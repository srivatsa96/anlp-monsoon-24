305/28840	Do not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a	32.021095275878906
306/28840	As for me I play my game squarely fairly and above board as I always	101.25440216064453
307/28840	Are you one of us Monsieur de Rochefort   I am very desirous of being so my lord but I am totally in the dark about	16.87601661682129
308/28840	In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort I am of Monsieur de Bassompierres	60.172630310058594
309/28840	Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France   He is dead sir a great	56.09529495239258
310/28840	His devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are	155.62014770507812
311/28840	I think so forsooth said Rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the Bast	36.363525390625
312/28840	However there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my	46.04640579223633
313/28840	Ah my dear Monsieur de Rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal Ah he was a great	22.45159149169922
314/28840	Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson   I never you know you may say anything to	64.00909423828125
315/28840	I try to be beloved not	604.2847900390625
316/28840	Well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says Like master like	96.7168197631836
317/28840	Pray what does that mean   It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of	31.722599029541016
318/28840	But those men you speak of said Mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against	70.10243225097656
319/28840	No in that case they would have met with more fitting	52.62085723876953
320/28840	They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking	98.15953826904297
321/28840	Ah said Mazarin with admirable suavity could I but find such men   My lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by	68.4756088256836
322/28840	Who is it   It is Monsieur dArtagn	6.030714988708496
323/28840	That Gascon cried Mazarin with well acted	64.75218963623047
324/28840	That Gascon has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a ty	60.42582321166992
325/28840	Really   It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excell	11.424931526184082
326/28840	Tell me a little about it my dear Monsieur de Roche	9.766766548156738
327/28840	That is somewhat difficult my lord said Rochefort with a	20.038362503051758
328/28840	Then he will tell it me	288.5398254394531
329/28840	Why do you doubt it   Because the secret does not belong to him because as I have told you it has to do with a great	25.44047737121582
330/28840	And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that   No my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just	65.41246032714844
331/28840	And were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united   As if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one	90.51776123046875
332/28840	You pique my curiosity dear Rochefort pray tell me the whole	113.1347427368164
333/28840	That is impossible but I will tell you a true story my	42.43035125732422
334/28840	Pray do so I delight in stories cried the	618.640625
335/28840	Listen then returned Rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals	54.19192886352539
336/28840	Once upon a time there lived a queena powerful monarchwho reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too	82.21654510498047
337/28840	Do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen re	112.3050765991211
338/28840	There came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like	62.805416107177734
339/28840	As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queens appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take	66.76993560791016
340/28840	There is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond	49.041587829589844
341/28840	This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from her high	133.61764526367188
342/28840	Indeed   Well my lord four men resolved to save	51.14515686035156
343/28840	These four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even	102.70906066894531
344/28840	They were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted	88.587158203125
345/28840	The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their	103.42964935302734
346/28840	Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop	74.98641967773438
347/28840	He crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the	42.331199645996094
348/28840	What do you think of that exploit my lord   It is magnificent said Mazarin thought	14.269661903381348
349/28840	Well I know of ten such	307.5589599609375
350/28840	You have nothing more to ask of me my lord said Roche	26.10332679748535
351/28840	And you say that Monsieur dArtagnan was one of those four men   He led the	15.662040710449219
352/28840	And who were the others   I leave it to Monsieur dArtagnan to name them my	20.815217971801758
353/28840	They were his friends and not	129.9330291748047
354/28840	He alone would have any influence with them I do not even know them under their true	49.047122955322266
355/28840	You suspect me Monsieur de Rochefort I want him and you and all to aid	61.40180587768555
356/28840	Begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to ones	64.01953887939453
357/28840	You my dear Monsieur de Rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go to Vincennes where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined you will guard him well for	17.169891357421875
358/28840	Well what is the matter   The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said Rochefort shaking his head with an air of	16.428924560546875
359/28840	What impossible And why is it impossible   Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends or rather I am one of	15.30945873260498
360/28840	Have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen   Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the	20.997343063354492
361/28840	That may be my lord but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your	35.06208419799805
362/28840	This then is what you call devotion I congratulate	139.36767578125
363/28840	Your devotion does not commit you too far Monsieur de Roche	57.11903381347656
364/28840	And then my lord continued Rochefort you understand that to emerge from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change ones	34.384552001953125
365/28840	Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said Maz	17.51649284362793
366/28840	My lord I have been so long shut up that I am only of one partyI am for fresh	82.37704467773438
367/28840	Employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high	73.10615539550781
368/28840	My dear Monsieur de Rochefort Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails	24.43592071533203
369/28840	Believe me you ought now to take a	239.2064208984375
370/28840	Here   You decide then nothing about me my lord   On the contrary I have come to a	29.3857421875
371/28840	Call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low	31.55689239501953
372/28840	Mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he	187.73944091796875
373/28840	I see my lord I am to be taken back to the Bast	22.347911834716797
374/28840	I shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ	33.915470123291016
375/28840	You the friend of my greatest foes Dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me Monsieur de Roche	27.299373626708984
376/28840	I shall find many men as able as you	64.34513854980469
377/28840	I wish you may my lord replied De Roche	34.79142761230469
378/28840	He was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where DArtagnan was	12.721181869506836
379/28840	In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his	37.52909851074219

384/28840	This is a detail preserved to us by Brien	108.90416717529297
385/28840	He now determined not to begin the game with DArtagnan till he knew completely all his adversarys	59.99402618408203

388/28840	Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the	55.394065856933594
389/28840	There was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of	38.38069534301758
390/28840	This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais	33.73727798461914
391/28840	Anne reclining in a large easychair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with	30.89496612548828
392/28840	This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with	214.01283264160156
393/28840	It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or	51.01315689086914
394/28840	When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his	27.847875595092773
395/28840	Why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience   Anne colored	117.90473175048828
396/28840	The prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the	63.013057708740234
397/28840	But Richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious	78.72972106933594
398/28840	How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did You were too young to know about such	41.186500549316406
399/28840	I do not remember what he did but I have inquired and I have been told all about	31.441560745239258
400/28840	And who told you about it asked Anne of Austria with a movement of impat	21.648059844970703
401/28840	I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if I do I shall learn nothing	97.33381652832031
402/28840	The king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand	47.95246124267578
403/28840	Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful	1074.9034423828125
404/28840	They explained what had occurred that	290.36956787109375
405/28840	He bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy Louis	65.45567321777344
406/28840	had entertained toward Mazarin and he endeavored to receive the ministers homage with civ	46.044979095458984
407/28840	Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had	83.44781494140625
408/28840	The minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais   It is time for the king to go to bed call Laport	25.000394821166992
409/28840	The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with	31.60679817199707
410/28840	In a few minutes Laporte came into the	14.65114974975586
411/28840	The child went directly to him without kissing his	119.1158447265625
412/28840	Well Louis said Anne why do you not kiss me   I thought you were angry with me madame you sent me	25.598773956298828
413/28840	I do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire	51.6341552734375
414/28840	You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to	54.07768249511719
415/28840	Sire interposed Laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle   To any one Laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except Manc	37.46728515625
416/28840	Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarins and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the	89.15142822265625
417/28840	And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the	21.91197967529297
418/28840	Good said Mazarin I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissim	13.570693016052246
419/28840	Why do you say that asked the queen almost timid	34.006404876708984
420/28840	Why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no	27.638837814331055
421/28840	Besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for	107.31970977783203
422/28840	That however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as I am to that of your	33.90990447998047
423/28840	I ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to	29.47947883605957
424/28840	But continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important	60.868045806884766
425/28840	What is it then   Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his count	19.396175384521484
426/28840	It is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to	59.00394058227539
427/28840	Why cried the queen how is that   Because as they say in the opera of Thisbe The whole world conspires to break our	56.53377151489258

464/28840	Which you answer according to your fancy replied Maz	141.6976776123047
465/28840	Tell me your wishes and I will comply with	75.9472885131836
466/28840	Well madame said Mazarin bowing I desire that you give me a share in your friends as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given	31.443082809448242
467/28840	The circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act	46.17721939086914
468/28840	I thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beau	26.96474838256836
469/28840	Yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still	98.65467834472656
470/28840	There is however a proverb current in France relating to water which is	115.0648422241211

473/28840	Do you think of him   Yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in Italy next after Monsieur de Condé comes the Duke of	35.27603530883789
474/28840	But he is mistaken I shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling	77.60761260986328
475/28840	Anne blushed and buried her face in her	58.93977355957031
476/28840	What am I to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her	133.1748046875
477/28840	Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to	43.512638092041016
478/28840	Anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful You are insulting me she	41.02167892456055
479/28840	I wish continued Mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut I wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your	90.03456115722656
480/28840	I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all I tell you   Madame I do not ask you to tell me said Mazarin astounded by this returning	37.94062423706055
481/28840	I will tell you all replied	27.745149612426758
482/28840	Listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my lifemy honor   Ah you confess it exclaimed Maz	77.07037353515625

484/28840	What relics are those by which you swear asked Mazarin	150.45567321777344
485/28840	The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the	67.83696746826172
486/28840	Open sir she said and look for	59.025272369384766
487/28840	Mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his	161.17633056640625
488/28840	What are these things replied Anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still	132.04539489746094
489/28840	These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to	54.62239074707031
490/28840	This knife is the knife with which Felton stabbed	99.49488830566406
491/28840	Read the letters and see if I have lied or spoken the	148.63632202148438
492/28840	But Mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the	50.10992431640625
493/28840	The blade was red for the blood had become rust after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary	62.66903305053711
494/28840	It is well madame I believe your	103.47444152832031
495/28840	No no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read I command you for I am resolved that everything shall be finished tonight and never will I recur to this subject	130.36123657226562
496/28840	Do you think she said with a ghastly smile that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations   Mazarin overcome by this determination read the two	50.04664611816406
497/28840	In one the queen asked for the ornaments back	124.142578125
498/28840	This letter had been conveyed by DArtagnan and had arrived in	14.844422340393066
499/28840	The other was that which Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too	33.779571533203125
500/28840	It is well madame said Mazarin nothing can gainsay such	85.83013916015625
501/28840	As she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her	35.05328369140625
502/28840	It appears she resumed that he sold ithe sold it in order to save me another timeto be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his dangerhe sold it to Monsieur des Essarts on whose finger I remarked	40.21601104736328
503/28840	I bought it from him but it belongs to DArtagn	18.35504150390625
504/28840	Give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him	46.85255813598633
505/28840	And now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me   Nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy	77.39485931396484
506/28840	I love you so tenderly that I cannot help being jealous even of the	30.098934173583984
507/28840	A smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the	29.322294235229492
508/28840	Since you have no further interrogations to make leave me I beseech you she	48.877723693847656
509/28840	I wish after such a scene to be	64.99483489990234
510/28840	Do you permit me to return   Yes	26.546186447143555
511/28840	The cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his	18.84511947631836
512/28840	Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sons room and inquired from Laporte if the king was in	36.7985725402832
513/28840	Laporte pointed to the child who was	61.88072967529297
514/28840	Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking Bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left	20.87885284423828
515/28840	When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antech	17.2696590423584
516/28840	There DArtagnan was asleep upon a	32.807464599609375
517/28840	The cardinal went up to him and touched his	29.702438354492188
518/28840	DArtagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under	50.26982879638672
519/28840	Who calls me   I said Mazarin with his most smiling	23.99846076965332
520/28840	I ask pardon of your eminence said DArtagnan but I was so fatigued   Dont ask my pardon monsieur said Mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my	15.365670204162598

522/28840	Come come murmured DArtagnan Rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he And he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of Roche	48.06470489501953
523/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable	14.726055145263672
524/28840	Possibly thought DArtagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for Mazarins	54.701393127441406
525/28840	Well continued Mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your val	62.77667236328125
526/28840	There was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of Mazarins	73.47516632080078
527/28840	Order my lord he said I am ready to obey your em	11.052425384521484
528/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last	16.494247436523438
529/28840	Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my	74.435546875
530/28840	It is true I fought with tolerable	170.17135620117188
531/28840	I dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said Mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by	60.38484191894531
532/28840	Well you do not reply resumed Maz	33.35284423828125
533/28840	I am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you	45.28329849243164
534/28840	I speak of the adventureEh you know well what I	40.49592971801758
535/28840	Alas no my lord replied DArtagnan	21.975204467773438
536/28840	I speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your	46.77186584472656
537/28840	Aha thought the Gascon is this a snare or not Let me be on my	148.1470947265625
538/28840	And he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have env	71.22163391113281
539/28840	Bravo cried Mazarin they told me that you were the man I	103.8641357421875
540/28840	Come let us see what you will do for	19.936025619506836
541/28840	Everything that your eminence may please to command me was the	39.59947204589844
542/28840	You will do for me what you have done for the queen   Certainly DArtagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak	16.818708419799805
543/28840	Hes not more cunning than De Richelieu was Devil take him Then he said aloud   The queen my lord I dont	36.56077194213867
544/28840	You dont comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me   Which of my friends my lord   Your three friendsthe friends of former	41.08049774169922
545/28840	Of former days my lord In former days I had not only three friends I had thirty at twoandtwenty one calls every man ones	97.83328247070312
546/28840	Well sir returned Mazarin prudence is a fine thing but today you might regret having been too	82.12313842773438
547/28840	My lord Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their	169.08428955078125
548/28840	But you have been silent for twenty years	40.03876876831055
549/28840	Speak now the queen herself releases you from your	254.80067443847656
550/28840	The queen said DArtagnan with an astonishment which this time was not	27.558109283447266
551/28840	Yes the queen And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you	47.89073181152344
552/28840	I remember well that diamond which belonged to the	53.73293685913086
553/28840	You see then that I speak to you in the queens	59.127559661865234
554/28840	Answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so	111.29219818115234
555/28840	Faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten	18.12169647216797
556/28840	We need only a week to amend all	216.4637908935547
557/28840	Come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends   I do not know my	12.74487590789795
558/28840	We have parted company this long time all three have left the	278.0778503417969
559/28840	Where can you find them then   Wherever they are thats my	77.66866302490234
560/28840	Well now what are your conditions if I employ you   Money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will	62.6138916015625
561/28840	I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which I was obliged to sell we should have remained on the	51.38761901855469
562/28840	The devil he does Money and a large sum said Maz	68.59622955322266
563/28840	Pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury   Do then as I did my	51.563377380371094
564/28840	Trust me dont let us try to do things	59.216976165771484
565/28840	Great undertakings come poorly off with paltry	221.93145751953125
566/28840	Well returned Mazarin we will satisfy	88.88706970214844
567/28840	Richelieu thought DArtagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in	24.507675170898438
568/28840	You will then be at my service asked Maz	31.18307876586914
569/28840	But if they refuse can I count on you   I have never accomplished anything alone said DArtagnan shaking his	24.971067428588867
570/28840	What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence   You know them better than	27.95549774169922
571/28840	Adapt your promises to their respective	183.12367248535156
572/28840	What shall I promise   That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be	65.7906723022461
573/28840	But what are we to do   Make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your	37.08346176147461
574/28840	My lord perhaps they are not in	89.90632629394531
575/28840	It is even probable that I shall have to make a	35.52397537231445
576/28840	I am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost	60.613834381103516
577/28840	My intention said Mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant	75.8841552734375
578/28840	Still my lord I cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and I cant travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service I have accumulated nothing but	40.79861831665039
579/28840	If these are Spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought DArtagnan we shall yet be able to do business	37.277854919433594
580/28840	He saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense	44.13016128540039
581/28840	Well then all is settled you are to set off said the	51.422454833984375
582/28840	Younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family	173.19851684570312
583/28840	These Gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the Italians in effron	74.89961242675781
584/28840	At all events answered DArtagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their	34.44850540161133
585/28840	He then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of	62.970947265625
586/28840	Crown pieces onlysilver pieces I suspected	1075.0828857421875
587/28840	Ah Mazarin Mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it   Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great	41.95745849609375
588/28840	In the meantime DArtagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne where he lived at the Hotel de la Chev	7.5824995040893555
589/28840	We will explain in a few words how DArtagnan had been led to choose that place of	53.03371047973633
590/28840	Years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of The Three Musketeers we took leave of DArtagnan at	73.36299896240234
591/28840	DArtagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to	30.502531051635742
592/28840	So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his	65.14889526367188
593/28840	He was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of	27.230300903320312
594/28840	Athos imparted to him his greatness of soul Porthos his enthusiasm Aramis his	105.63571166992188
595/28840	Had DArtagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior	39.21930694580078
596/28840	Athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois Porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly Aramis the third to take orders and become an abb	45.528865814208984
597/28840	From that day DArtagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from	50.67853927612305
598/28840	Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers DArtagnan felt completely	109.72530364990234
599/28840	For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees eff	92.09471893310547
600/28840	A garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly DArtagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became I know not how in the present age one would express it a typical	68.33183288574219
601/28840	These important advantages DArtagnan found to his own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the	24.13981819152832
602/28840	He was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken	92.59661102294922
603/28840	Bigamy my dear Come now you dont really wish it   But he is dead I am sure of	44.974937438964844
604/28840	He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us	116.60670471191406
605/28840	All right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so	68.29727172851562
606/28840	Peste my darling another way of getting	154.59371948242188
607/28840	So you refuse my request   To be sure I dofuriously   The pretty landlady was	29.60895347595215
608/28840	She would have taken DArtagnan not only as her husband but as her God he was so handsome and had so fierce a	49.897396087646484
609/28840	Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of FrancheCom	137.58258056640625
610/28840	DArtagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to	28.83458709716797
611/28840	There were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithfulall of course on the part of the host	111.28970336914062
612/28840	DArtagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his	55.18083953857422
613/28840	As to that we know DArtagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of	43.71615982055664
614/28840	He had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give	64.59703826904297
615/28840	One believes readily what he wishes to	593.0081787109375
616/28840	Now in the army from the divisiongenerals who desire the death of the generalinchief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some ones	53.034088134765625
617/28840	But DArtagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like	16.266115188598633
618/28840	After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield the cool freshness of the night brought him to	59.721702575683594
619/28840	He gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in	84.638427734375
620/28840	He was petted tended cured and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for	110.52473449707031
621/28840	Once in France he turned his course toward Paris and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiqueton	32.37579345703125
622/28840	But DArtagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the	54.01414108276367
623/28840	So much the worse and so much the better   It need not be said that DArtagnan was still thinking of the	16.174583435058594
624/28840	He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a	59.22126770019531
625/28840	Monsieur has returned then   Of course naively replied the	33.05309295654297
626/28840	If I had any money said DArtagnan to himself I would go away but I have	17.144407272338867
627/28840	I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune appar	40.12547302246094
628/28840	Is that monsieur said DArtagnan to	7.041749000549316
629/28840	Oh oh he has grown a good deal it seems to	38.246124267578125
630/28840	And he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous	33.136592864990234
631/28840	The hostess as she entered saw DArtagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon DArtagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tender	31.348033905029297
632/28840	The Swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned	16.225048065185547
633/28840	Ah it is you monsieur What do you want of me she asked in great	29.16765022277832
634/28840	Is monsieur your cousin Is monsieur your brother said DArtagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was	28.72931480407715
635/28840	And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian who received him with great cold	29.75600242614746
636/28840	Monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gas	32.43903350830078
637/28840	Your husband then is at last dead   How does that concern you replied the	63.994693756103516
638/28840	It concerns me much said DArtagnan since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since   And since asked the	55.43441390991211
639/28840	And sinceI do not give it said the musket	43.513607025146484
640/28840	The Swiss became as purple as a pe	164.51889038085938
641/28840	He wore his elegant uniform DArtagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the Swiss was six feet high DArtagnan was hardly more than five the Swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded DArtagnan as an	33.32342529296875
642/28840	Will you go away from here demanded the Swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously	63.21909713745117
643/28840	Some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so	59.42586898803711
644/28840	DArtagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction   Stay you where you are and dont you stir or I will pull this ear	92.30574798583984
645/28840	As for you illustrious descendant of William Tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another	101.82864379882812
646/28840	And why   Ah very well said DArtagnan I see that you understand	15.441780090332031
647/28840	Come then and take a turn with me and I will	26.8230037689209
648/28840	The hostess who knew DArtagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her	35.97426223754883
649/28840	DArtagnan turned toward her saying Then send him away mad	49.284210205078125
650/28840	It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of	38.574005126953125
651/28840	DArtagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the Swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his	33.894805908203125
652/28840	Then you will lie here said DArtagn	29.329076766967773
653/28840	It is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen	29.303598403930664
654/28840	With these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his	45.203697204589844
655/28840	He had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all	160.1532745361328
656/28840	The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit	59.537818908691406
657/28840	There said DArtagnan what did I tell you Fortunately you wont be laid up more than a	31.405494689941406
658/28840	Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the	105.1104507446289
659/28840	Goodby Oh by the way youd better take lodging in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pel	92.32599639892578
660/28840	You will be well fed there if the hostess remains the	52.22453308105469
661/28840	Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss the things that belonged to	51.46321105957031
662/28840	The boy found him sitting where DArtagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his	26.554351806640625
663/28840	The boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for DArtagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve lab	50.0889892578125
664/28840	But when he was alone with the hostess he said Now pretty Madeleine you know the difference between a Swiss and a	26.656885147094727
665/28840	As for you you have acted like a barm	64.02896881103516
666/28840	So much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my	68.28511810302734
667/28840	I have driven away the Swiss to humiliate you but I shall lodge here no	59.127220153808594
668/28840	I will not sleep where I must	75.5914077758789
669/28840	Ho there boy Have my valise carried to the Muid dAmour Rue des Bourdonna	131.895751953125
670/28840	In saying these words DArtagnan appeared at the same time majestic and g	24.882755279541016
671/28840	The hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet	75.71153259277344
672/28840	What more need be said The spit turned the stove roared the pretty Madeleine wept DArtagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and	75.01982116699219
673/28840	He pardoned and having pardoned he	95.75106811523438
674/28840	And this explains how DArtagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne at the Hotel de la Chev	10.196365356445312
675/28840	DArtagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying Mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that	37.44741439819336
676/28840	Then I should like to have three sons I should make the first a nobleman like Athos the second a good soldier like Porthos the third an excellent abbé like Aram	47.401145935058594
677/28840	Faith that would be a far better life than I lead now but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch who wont dispossess himself of his diamond in my	84.41972351074219
678/28840	On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the	29.670589447021484
679/28840	Oho said he is the hotel on fire On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was	93.20069885253906
680/28840	The people were shouting and running about with	138.146240234375
681/28840	By the light of one of these torches DArtagnan perceived men in	48.45844268798828
682/28840	In his youth DArtagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a	34.41530227661133
683/28840	There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good Burg	51.93178176879883
684/28840	He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his	69.04420471191406
685/28840	He had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the	73.52153778076172
686/28840	His first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to	61.237571716308594
687/28840	Not to reflect on what had passed as one might	205.57530212402344
688/28840	No DArtagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper	33.179473876953125
689/28840	He was hungry he supped he went to	85.13292694091797
690/28840	Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with	62.001888275146484
691/28840	In the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of	94.2075424194336
692/28840	It was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always slept all night	41.134803771972656
693/28840	At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his	58.86455535888672
694/28840	In 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal I received a letter from Ath	36.0563850402832
695/28840	Where was I then Let me	233.49859619140625
696/28840	Oh at the siege of Besancon I was in the	58.5452995300293
697/28840	Let me see with regard to Porthos I received a letter from him	50.093082427978516
698/28840	He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of September 16	56.58271789550781
699/28840	Unluckily as I was then in Bearn on account of my fathers death the letter followed me	50.29743194580078
700/28840	I had left Bearn when it arrived and I never received it until the month of April 1647 and as the invitation was for September 1646 I couldnt accept	71.81413269042969
701/28840	Let me look for this letter it must be with my title	136.52706909179688
702/28840	DArtagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his	24.692188262939453
703/28840	He uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy	39.849849700927734
704/28840	DArtagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the Chateau du Vall	16.123741149902344
705/28840	Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vall	30.201528549194336
706/28840	Devil take the vain fellow said DArtagn	82.97774505615234
707/28840	However I had better find him out first since he cant want	116.31049346923828
708/28840	Athos must have become an idiot by this time from	165.91085815429688
709/28840	Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflex	122.34147644042969
710/28840	He cast his eyes again on the	109.15559387207031
711/28840	There was a postscript   I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his	38.178497314453125
712/28840	In his convent What convent There are about two hundred in Paris and three thousand in France and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his	82.44268035888672
713/28840	Well suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries It would be a curious idea and maybe I should find my friend under the name of	66.04713439941406
714/28840	But no I should lose myself in the cardinals	87.94840240478516
715/28840	Great people only thank you for doing the impossible whats possible they say they can effect themselves and they are	132.40963745117188
716/28840	But let us wait a little and	69.77537536621094
717/28840	I received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact I rendered	46.5533561706543
718/28840	Yes yes but now what did I do with that letter   DArtagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old	24.30156135559082
719/28840	He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its	41.85578536987305
720/28840	As I am of the church and the affair might injure me if I should share it with any other than a sure friend like you I write to beg that you will serve me as	48.14133834838867
721/28840	You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine under the second lamp on the right you will find your	41.995567321777344
722/28840	I shall be with mine under the	62.795833587646484
723/28840	He had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty swordstroke on the arm then had gone toward Aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his	54.525108337402344
724/28840	I think I have killed the insolent	17.836854934692383
725/28840	But dear friend if you ever need me you know that I am entirely devoted to	19.469371795654297
726/28840	Thereupon Aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arc	31.15524673461914
727/28840	So then he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room	53.58073043823242
728/28840	He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was	110.3486328125
729/28840	He was not mistaken as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the	41.616302490234375
730/28840	Ah you scoundrel cried DArtagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his	21.870214462280273
731/28840	Sir cried the man in the name of Heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me	44.67401123046875
732/28840	Im no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my	84.3526840209961
733/28840	My name isah but surely you are Monsieur dArtagnan   And thouPlanchet cried the	22.31857681274414
734/28840	At your service sir said Planchet overwhelmed with joy if I were still capable of serving	32.90842056274414
735/28840	Sir said the prudent Planchet in the first place are you on good terms with Monsieur de Rochefort   Perfectly one of my dearest	16.592863082885742
736/28840	Ah so much the better   But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room   Ah sir I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is   Planchet	17.503063201904297
737/28840	Egad I know where he is said DArtagn	15.281557083129883
738/28840	That is to say he was there replied Planc	34.357208251953125
739/28840	But in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse	37.813072204589844
740/28840	The prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for	111.10465240478516
741/28840	I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the Duc de Beaufort who called for	15.247900009155273
742/28840	The people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and Monsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the	40.62477493286133
743/28840	At this moment a patrol passed	128.21832275390625
744/28840	I was obliged to sound a retreat toward the Rue Tiquetonne I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where I have been concealed between two matt	30.83677864074707
745/28840	This morning I ventured to run along the gutters and   Well interrupted DArtagnan I am delighted that De Rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the kings servants they will hang thee without	45.75044250488281
746/28840	Nevertheless I promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though I risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that I gave one rebel an	79.9863510131836
747/28840	Ah sir you know well I would risk my life for	76.68012237548828

750/28840	Sit down there and eat in	226.9309844970703
751/28840	I see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my	136.89906311035156
752/28840	Yes sir for all Ive had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on	79.06556701660156

754/28840	Ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried Planc	32.662940979003906
755/28840	And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the Rue des Fossoyeurs whilst DArtagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of Planchet under present	26.22833251953125
756/28840	While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up for lost time at	108.91419219970703
757/28840	At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his	37.40199661254883
758/28840	Come said DArtagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where Athos is   No sir replied Planc	16.186840057373047

765/28840	DArtagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go	17.685510635375977
766/28840	Sir said Planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate Think if I am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a	32.29469299316406

772/28840	DArtagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire Madeleine to come	30.387252807617188
773/28840	When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planc	57.81405258178711

778/28840	You must dress him up during my	213.62071228027344

785/28840	In this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet pleased with himself DArtagnan reached Notre	56.74665069580078
786/28840	He ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew Monsieur Baz	54.3867073059082
787/28840	Monsieur Bazin the beadle said the ver	44.64695358276367

789/28840	DArtagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding Bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other	45.43890380859375
790/28840	He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at Baz	34.33638381958008
791/28840	Bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propri	71.71410369873047

793/28840	It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone	87.58840942382812
794/28840	Bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a	44.99848937988281
795/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan he cried Vade retro Satanas   So my dear Bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old	17.0542049407959
796/28840	Sir replied Bazin the true friends of a Christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing	66.28233337402344
797/28840	I dont understand you Bazin nor can I see how I can be a stumblingblock in the way of your salvation said DArtagn	19.420209884643555
798/28840	You forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the	62.87199783325195
799/28840	My dear Bazin you ought to perceive said DArtagnan from the place in which you find me that I am greatly changed in	36.540260314941406
800/28840	Age produces good sense and as I doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation I want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to	44.81961441040039
801/28840	Rather say to take him back with you into the	90.10912322998047
802/28840	Fortunately I dont know where he	14.628616333007812
803/28840	How cried DArtagnan you dont know where Aramis is   Formerly replied Bazin Aramis was his name of perd	23.98914337158203
804/28840	By Aramis is meant Simara which is the name of a	45.007930755615234
805/28840	Happily for him he has ceased to bear that	61.78750228881836
806/28840	And therefore said DArtagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not Aramis I seek but the Abbé dHerbl	18.750308990478516
807/28840	Come my dear Bazin tell me where he	15.034408569335938
808/28840	Didnt you hear me tell you Monsieur dArtagnan that I dont know where he is   Yes certainly but to that I answer that it is	21.765867233276367
809/28840	It is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good	46.18259811401367
810/28840	DArtagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of Aramis but whose lies were bold and	49.978797912597656
811/28840	Well Bazin said DArtagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good	29.649248123168945

814/28840	Incorruptible murmured DArtagnan I am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind	47.17023849487305
815/28840	DArtagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the	15.777724266052246
816/28840	He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of	30.4291934967041

829/28840	On honor   What then is there surprising in that  	27.657882690429688
830/28840	And in whose behalf are you looking for them   You are in no doubt on that	19.665063858032227
831/28840	Unfortunately I have no idea where they	64.9513931274414
832/28840	And you have no way to get news of them Wait a week and I myself will give you	32.2578239440918

839/28840	Theres no second Constance in the	36.180458068847656
840/28840	On his return to the cathedral DArtagnan saw Bazin who was conversing with the sacrist	19.113262176513672
841/28840	Bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous	463.7489013671875
842/28840	DArtagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to	17.039121627807617
843/28840	DArtagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes it was impossible that Bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing	17.844974517822266
844/28840	In five minutes Bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no	39.031837463378906
845/28840	Calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre	94.77688598632812
846/28840	Afraid of making any inquiries at this house DArtagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocr	30.39516258239746
847/28840	This beverage required a good halfhour to	322.5790100097656
848/28840	And DArtagnan had time therefore to watch Bazin unsus	21.55597496032715
849/28840	He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chor	47.37580108642578
850/28840	He questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving DArtagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the	33.944820404052734
851/28840	Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of Bazins	117.74501037597656
852/28840	Look said the boy theres our beadle who is going a	83.41845703125
853/28840	And where is he going asked DArtagn	10.149276733398438
854/28840	Half a pistole if you can find out said DArtagn	15.392447471618652
855/28840	For me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if I can find out where Bazin is going That is not	36.93409729003906
856/28840	You are not joking are you   No on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it	34.123016357421875
857/28840	Just the very way not to	177.38902282714844
858/28840	Wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find	159.98916625976562
859/28840	The halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his	22.838088989257812
860/28840	I understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de	51.379512786865234
861/28840	Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding	45.76234436035156
862/28840	Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full	31.056005477905273
863/28840	Before ten minutes had elapsed the child	229.38589477539062
864/28840	Well answered the boy the thing is	74.67042541503906
865/28840	Where is he gone   The halfpistole is for me   Doubtless answer	26.032421112060547
866/28840	Give it me that I may see it is not	62.999088287353516
867/28840	The child put the piece of money into his	35.487430572509766
868/28840	And now where is he gone inquired DArtagn	24.885976791381836
869/28840	How dost thou know   Ah faith there was no great cunning	68.72533416748047
870/28840	I knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to	125.45933532714844
871/28840	Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was	64.03712463378906
872/28840	And he answered that Monsieur Bazin went to No	17.9387264251709

876/28840	DArtagnan wrote the childs name in his	31.619474411010742
877/28840	Please sir said the boy do you think I can gain any more halfpistoles in any way   Perhaps replied DArtagn	19.503002166748047
878/28840	And having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the Rue Tiqueton	35.99906539916992
879/28840	DArtagnan Going to a Distance to discover Aram	19.284385681152344
880/28840	On entering the hotel DArtagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the	22.4039363861084
881/28840	It was Planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that DArtagnan himself could hardly recognize	32.883419036865234
882/28840	Madeleine introduced him in presence of all the	141.57855224609375
883/28840	Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded Madeleines brother entered DArtagnans	75.96728515625
884/28840	The plan adopted by DArtagnan was soon	36.31711196899414
885/28840	He resolved not to reach Noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for Noisy is only three or four leagues from Paris on the road to Me	42.25667190551758
886/28840	A most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de la Chevrette for the discovery of Planc	26.928403854370117
887/28840	At about a league and a half from the city DArtagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing	31.394960403442383
888/28840	The inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly	49.8145866394043
889/28840	A man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to	34.82120895385742
890/28840	At four oclock DArtagnan recommenced his	18.397443771362305
891/28840	He proceeded slowly and in deep rever	69.54158020019531
892/28840	Planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the	43.14195251464844
893/28840	One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to DArtagnans deliberations this was the name of Madame de Longue	29.023334503173828
894/28840	That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce	472.9986267089844
895/28840	Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also one of the greatest beauties at	19.133888244628906
896/28840	She had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the Place Royale by the Duc de Gu	37.24354553222656
897/28840	He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful Madame de Longue	30.818323135375977
898/28840	He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when Planchet approached and said   I will lay a wager your honor that you and I are thinking of the same	37.96958923339844
899/28840	I doubt it Planchet replied DArtagnan but what are you thinking of   I am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we	29.932863235473633
900/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan Planchets recital agreeing with his own	24.65515899658203
901/28840	Well   One of these two men said He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening for I have seen his	47.441619873046875
902/28840	Art thou sure said the man in the	161.30050659179688
903/28840	If he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with	161.46302795410156
904/28840	What to do with him answered the	50.21957778930664
905/28840	Yes hes not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow hell defend	41.294559478759766
906/28840	Well we must try to take him	56.4590950012207
907/28840	Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth   We	123.20216369628906
908/28840	Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horse	48.973976135253906
909/28840	Yes yes my lord dont be	43.10107421875
910/28840	You will assure us that justice   Yes yes I answer for all that the prince	56.97722625732422
911/28840	Having said that they went out of the	34.66368103027344
912/28840	Well what matters all that to us said DArtagn	32.2057991027832
913/28840	This is one of those attempts that happen every	66.2176742553711
914/28840	Are you sure that we are not its objects   We Why   Just remember what they	79.38202667236328
915/28840	I have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to	47.95928955078125
916/28840	Well   He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to	40.178279876708984
917/28840	What else   Then the prince said Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musket	29.98193359375
918/28840	Now then what do you say to that   Alas my dear Planchet said DArtagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate	19.759044647216797
919/28840	Those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no gr	203.83848571777344
920/28840	Is your honor sure   I can answer for it they do	36.63166809082031
921/28840	Well we wont speak of it any more then and Planchet took his place in DArtagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not	42.028324127197266
922/28840	They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up to DArtagn	30.110353469848633
923/28840	Stop sir look yonder he whispered dont you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows I fancy I hear horses	177.0594482421875
924/28840	The ground is soaking wet yet I fancy as thou sayest that I see	221.6574249267578
925/28840	At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and	104.49596405029297
926/28840	There are men somewhere about but thats of no consequence to us said DArtagnan let us ride	49.123809814453125
927/28840	At about halfpast eight oclock they reached the first houses in Noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the	26.438627243041992
928/28840	The obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of	115.2052230834961
929/28840	Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like perid	115.72486114501953
930/28840	These were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the	83.59354400634766
931/28840	Toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous limet	51.44316482543945
932/28840	This he said to Planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair Madame de Longueville but the convent where is that   The convent your honor is at the other end of the village I know it	18.179737091064453
933/28840	Well then Planchet gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horses girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits	49.31986999511719
934/28840	Sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted	45.63337707519531

936/28840	If I were a monk I should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and	78.44181823730469
937/28840	Yes added Planchet like the famous ass of Bur	154.01231384277344
938/28840	Shall I knock   Hush replied DArtagnan the light no longer burns in yonder	30.783000946044922
939/28840	What is that noise   There came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded DArtagnan and Planc	40.17298126220703
940/28840	Heyday cried DArtagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken is it really for us that you mean your attack   Here he is we have him cried the horsemen rushing on DArtagnan with naked	37.92384338378906

942/28840	No my lord be assured we shall	38.72758483886719
943/28840	DArtagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the	21.301414489746094
944/28840	Halloo gentlemen he called out in his Gascon accent what do you want what do you demand   That thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horse	50.43614196777344
945/28840	Stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his	86.01995849609375
946/28840	Ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into a passion at random at Noisy Take care for I warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my swordand my sword is longI rip him	91.32406616210938
947/28840	The chieftain of the party drew	55.84519577026367
948/28840	What are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to	32.45726776123047
949/28840	And youwhat are you doing here replied DArtagn	15.046783447265625
950/28840	Be civil or I shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones	98.68046569824219
951/28840	You dont choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned DArtagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant I have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my	39.52197265625
952/28840	Do you know Monsieur dArtagnan   Lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are Monsieur dArtagnan   I	7.406383037567139

954/28840	It seems said DArtagnan that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of	43.718502044677734
955/28840	Come replied the same lofty tone answer Are you waiting for him underneath these windows Did you come to Noisy to defend him   I am waiting for no one replied DArtagnan who was beginning to be	30.077959060668945
956/28840	I propose to defend no one but myself and I shall defend myself vigorously I give you	42.59486770629883
957/28840	Very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to	57.713409423828125
958/28840	Our blow has failed for tonight let us	307.57244873046875
959/28840	We shall meet again Master dArtagnan continued the leader raising his	60.8140869140625
960/28840	Yes but never with the same advantages said DArtagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be	22.54361343383789
961/28840	Very good very good said the	193.40264892578125
962/28840	And the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to	30.004636764526367
963/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their	26.391347885131836
964/28840	Thou seest simpleton said DArtagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to	40.687374114990234
965/28840	But to whom then   Ifaith I neither know nor	44.90852355957031
966/28840	What I do care for now is to make my way into the Jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their	77.06746673583984
967/28840	Happen what will the devil take them they cant eat	212.21810913085938
968/28840	Planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank	29.895849227905273
969/28840	Hey your honor cried Planchet Ive a man behind	33.1399040222168
970/28840	DArtagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchets	38.201560974121094
971/28840	Tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new	51.581390380859375
972/28840	No no dear DArtagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis Aramis gallop fast Planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the	24.40506935119629
973/28840	And Planchet with Aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by DArtagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic	15.392024993896484
974/28840	At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of Aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in	34.756141662597656
975/28840	Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three	14.107725143432617
976/28840	Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from	209.8183135986328
977/28840	My friend said Aramis if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to receive	30.340803146362305
978/28840	Ah said DArtagnan is that the way you return to your apartment   After nine at night pardieu said Aramis the rule of the convent is very	33.06870651245117
979/28840	Pardon me my dear friend said DArtagnan I think you said pardieu   Do you think so said Aramis smiling it is	12.574177742004395
980/28840	You have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom I am obliged to	73.6310043334961
981/28840	But will you not go up   Pass on before me I beg of	38.01967239379883
982/28840	As the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way s	52.24479293823242
983/28840	And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an	44.87141036987305
984/28840	DArtagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was	36.90066909790039
985/28840	I beg your pardon said Aramis noticing his awkwardness if I had known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardeners ladder but for me alone this is good	34.78059387207031
986/28840	Sir said Planchet when he saw DArtagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you in case of necessity I might also climb up but my two horses cannot mount the	28.625553131103516
987/28840	Take them to yonder shed my friend said Aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and	52.985267639160156
988/28840	Marry forsooth people dont die of hunger	591.5463256835938
989/28840	And Aramis drawing in the ladder closed the	94.45435333251953
990/28840	Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more	71.71841430664062
991/28840	At each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de Lorraine the Cardinal de Richelieu the Cardinal de la Valette and the Archbishop of Borde	45.941627502441406
992/28840	Exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abb	52.741573333740234
993/28840	You are examining my den said Aram	87.13359832763672
994/28840	Ah my dear fellow excuse me I am lodged like a Chartre	33.90886306762695
995/28840	But what are you looking for   I am looking for the person who let down the	26.374181747436523
996/28840	I see no one and yet the ladder didnt come down of	168.60523986816406
997/28840	But continued Aramis Bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that I was not alone he discreetly	68.41431427001953
998/28840	Sit down my dear friend and let us	37.50608444213867
999/28840	And Aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which DArtagnan stretched himself	28.020471572875977
1000/28840	In the first place you will sup with me will you not asked Aram	19.007217407226562
1001/28840	Yes if you really wish it said DArtagnan and even with great pleasure I confess the journey has given me a devil of an	32.2821044921875
1002/28840	Ah my poor friend said Aramis you will find meagre fare you were not	46.36659622192383
1003/28840	Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur   Oh let us hope said Aramis that with the help of God and of Bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit	37.78573989868164
1004/28840	The door opened and Bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of	16.237504959106445
1005/28840	So far well said Aramis we are dying of	68.44496154785156
1006/28840	Serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good	140.58438110351562
1007/28840	Bazin bowed low sighed and left the	48.366214752197266
1008/28840	Now we are alone dear Aramis said DArtagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchets	22.63262939453125
1009/28840	Ifaith answered Aramis as you see from	225.53860473632812
1010/28840	From Heaven replied DArtagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going	23.320287704467773
1011/28840	My friend said Aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which DArtagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if I did not come from Heaven at least I was leaving Paradise which is almost the	23.690500259399414
1012/28840	Paradise is at Noisy le Sec upon the site of the archbishops chate	31.27022361755371
1013/28840	Aramis burst into a fit of	9.117462158203125
1014/28840	You were always a merry companion my dear DArtagnan he said and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted	42.4426155090332
1015/28840	Yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is Madame de Longueville with whom I am in	17.530832290649414
1016/28840	A plague ont I shall not do	37.80131149291992
1017/28840	Eventually she was obliged to leave	39.81486511230469
1018/28840	He was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued Aramis glancing at the portrait of the old	48.85456466674805
1019/28840	For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear Marie I know only one other woman who can do it as	122.83694458007812
1020/28840	So they made this song about her _Laboissiere dis moi	164.3357391357422
1021/28840	You know it dont you   No sing it	207.49293518066406
1022/28840	Aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively	69.49784851074219
1023/28840	Bravo cried DArtagnan you sing charmingly dear Aram	80.74775695800781
1024/28840	I do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your	130.19264221191406
1025/28840	My dear DArtagnan replied Aramis you understand when I was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could now when I am an abbé I say as few masses as I	31.477794647216797
1026/28840	Whichthe Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville   Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville Little flirtations perhaps and thats	12.413422584533691
1027/28840	No I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse did you see her after her return from Brussels after the kings death   Yes she is still	23.879409790039062
1028/28840	Yes said Aramis I saw her also at that	25.17580795288086
1029/28840	I gave her good advice by which she did not	75.2457046508789
1030/28840	I ventured to tell her that Mazarin was the lover of Anne of	17.128477096557617
1031/28840	She wouldnt believe me saying that she knew Anne of Austria who was too proud to love such a worthless cox	40.266571044921875
1032/28840	After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of Beaufort and the coxcomb arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de Chevre	30.06045150756836
1033/28840	You know resumed DArtagnan that she has had leave to return to France   Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or	41.07307434082031
1034/28840	Oh but this time perhaps she will follow your	63.092613220214844
1035/28840	Oh this time returned Aramis I havent seen her she is much	65.83229064941406
1036/28840	In that respect unlike you my dear Aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a pre	50.343833923339844
1037/28840	Yes replied Aramis I am extremely careful of my	39.256954193115234
1038/28840	Do you know that I am growing old I am nearly thirty	32.195556640625
1039/28840	Indeed Then tis I who am mistaken for you have always been a good chron	46.67589569091797
1040/28840	By your reckoning I must be fortythree at	102.70137023925781
1041/28840	The devil I am Dont let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abb	31.66939926147461
1042/28840	Why what in the world cried Aramis is that animal Bazin doing Bazin Hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst   Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each	53.55299377441406
1043/28840	But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on	45.648380279541016
1044/28840	Bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his	55.218666076660156
1045/28840	DArtagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abbé dHerblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the Musketeer Aramis remained staring with wideopen eyes at the face of his	30.3572940826416
1046/28840	Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that DArtagnan was quite	25.525808334350586
1047/28840	But you expected some one then asked the	132.79446411132812
1048/28840	Oh said Aramis I always try to be prepared and then I knew you were seeking	44.07608413696289
1049/28840	From whom   From Master Bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musket	38.80108642578125
1050/28840	Oh monsieur said Bazin clasping his hands supplicating	10.807671546936035
1051/28840	Come no hypocrisy you know that I dont like	64.06307983398438
1052/28840	You will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his	48.16049575805664
1053/28840	Planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed	50.80177307128906
1054/28840	Bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to Planchet who then went satisfied to his	51.844512939453125
1055/28840	The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable	42.14472961425781
1056/28840	The deuce cried DArtagnan do you live in this way always   Yes pretty	32.714534759521484
1057/28840	Nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said DArtagn	39.9907112121582
1058/28840	What can you expect replied Aramis in a tone of	38.46990966796875
1059/28840	Every man thats born must fulfil his	569.9146728515625
1060/28840	If it be not an indelicate question resumed DArtagnan have you grown rich   Oh Heaven	41.73513412475586
1061/28840	I make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave	34.241886138916016
1062/28840	And how do you make your twelve thousand francs By your poems   No I have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram I compose sermons my	66.82472229003906
1063/28840	What sermons Do you preach them   No I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great or	63.255943298339844
1064/28840	Ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself   I should my dear DArtagnan have been so but nature said	64.87240600585938
1065/28840	When I am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me I look at her again if she smiles I smile	106.73845672607422
1066/28840	Then I speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of	151.8388214111328
1067/28840	An event took place in the Church of	96.63932800292969
1068/28840	I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of	105.6676025390625
1069/28840	Tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbélike all other abb	40.806129455566406
1070/28840	And what was the end of the affair   We met in the Place RoyaleEgad you know about	27.944568634033203
1071/28840	Was I not your second cried DArtagn	66.2816390991211

1073/28840	Did he die   I dont	42.51243209838867
1074/28840	But at all events I gave him absolution in articulo mort	21.021286010742188
1075/28840	Tis enough to kill the body without killing the	104.3371353149414
1076/28840	Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was	98.36279296875
1077/28840	Bazin my friend said Aramis you dont seem to be aware that I can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all I have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprob	24.1757755279541
1078/28840	You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to	39.28086471557617
1079/28840	Besides my friend DArtagnan has something to say to me privately have you not DArtagnan   DArtagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired after placing on the table the Spanish	13.570560455322266
1080/28840	The two friends left alone remained silent face to	58.908363342285156
1081/28840	Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion DArtagnan to be preparing his exord	30.80280876159668
1082/28840	Each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly	53.941261291503906
1083/28840	It was Aramis who broke the	63.812015533447266
1084/28840	What are you thinking of DArtagnan he	23.404796600341797
1085/28840	I was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musket	27.377140045166016
1086/28840	Tis true man as you know said Aramis is a strange animal made up of	50.599388122558594
1087/28840	Since I became an abbé I dream of nothing but	65.0956039428711
1088/28840	That is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting	136.1278839111328
1089/28840	Do you still fence well   II fence as well as you did in the old timebetter still perhaps I do nothing else all	78.8797607421875
1090/28840	And with whom   With an excellent masteratarms that we have	48.119361877441406
1091/28840	What here   Yes here in this convent my dear	55.70301818847656
1092/28840	There is everything in a Jesuit	113.97254943847656
1093/28840	Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men   Undoubtedly said Aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if I could have drawn without being	28.249086380004883
1094/28840	Well I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please prince though he	41.27361297607422
1095/28840	Hold on wait said Aramis that is an idea   Of which I invite you to take advantage my	61.58745193481445
1096/28840	Let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich Answer	57.628047943115234
1097/28840	I I am as poor as Job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes I dont believe you would find a hundred pist	48.688968658447266
1098/28840	Peste a hundred pistoles said DArtagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as Job If I had them I should think myself as rich as Croes	30.473478317260742
1099/28840	Then aloud Are you ambitious   As Encelad	63.60820007324219
1100/28840	Well my friend I bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you	40.835365295410156
1101/28840	The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramiss face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape DArtagnans	45.93297576904297
1102/28840	Do you take any interest in politics   A gleam of light shone in Aramiss eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by DArtagn	25.208799362182617
1103/28840	Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but God   It is	79.46356201171875
1104/28840	Have you my dear Aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play   Certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious	87.48638916015625
1105/28840	Well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again I am commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you who were the very soul of our	98.88494110107422
1106/28840	Aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the	116.15474700927734
1107/28840	To meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easy	49.03321075439453
1108/28840	Ah dear DArtagnan see how regularly I live and how easy I am	42.17782974243164
1109/28840	We have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well	56.6719856262207
1110/28840	Yet the great sometimes repent of their ingrat	52.1213264465332
1111/28840	In that case it would be quite another	32.07126998901367

1113/28840	How can you know that You who never interest yourself in politics   Ah without caring about them myself I live among those who are much occupied in	72.94284057617188
1114/28840	I have no doubt of it said DArtagn	6.303891181945801
1115/28840	Now my dear friend look upon all I tell you as merely the statement of a monkof a man who resembles an echorepeating simply what he	98.73445129394531
1116/28840	I will not contradict you there said DArtagn	12.901046752929688
1117/28840	I must confess that I was	23.190141677856445
1118/28840	Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius as I thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio and he got on by	22.31025505065918
1119/28840	He is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in	33.68107223510742
1120/28840	He will amass wealth he will injure the kings revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to	136.88221740722656
1121/28840	He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantal	75.53426361083984
1122/28840	Do you know him I do	16.826679229736328
1123/28840	Hem said DArtagnan there is some truth in what you	24.30331039428711
1124/28840	Ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which I am endowed I am approved by a man like you fresh from the	56.261512756347656
1125/28840	But you speak of him not of his party his	149.40695190429688
1126/28840	It is truethe queen is for	163.71519470214844

1130/28840	He was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but	36.05274200439453
1131/28840	You see my poor friend that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to Maz	74.76469421386719
1132/28840	I cried DArtagnan not in the	14.758749008178711

1136/28840	Heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a	80.12801361083984
1137/28840	You are right DArtagnan I held a similar project but as I had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to	63.722862243652344
1138/28840	Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak	20.29306983947754
1139/28840	Monsieur de Gondy the cardinals enemy   No the kings friend said Aramis the kings friend you	17.55580711364746
1140/28840	Well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans	52.9710578918457
1141/28840	He is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the kings enemies are preparing for the poor	76.37210845947266
1142/28840	Ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear Aram	34.24454879760742
1143/28840	Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarins	15.012333869934082
1144/28840	But his heart will be in the army commanded by the Duc de Beau	22.614078521728516

1149/28840	Oh oh said Aramis there are questions between them at this very	37.84591293334961
1150/28840	And besides if it is not the prince then Monsieur de Gondy   But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for	18.019601821899414
1151/28840	And are there no cardinals that can fight Come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant and Monsieur de G	53.114173889160156
1152/28840	But a humpbacked general   Under the cuirass the hump will not be	67.54705047607422
1153/28840	Besides remember that Alexander was lame and Hannibal had but one	213.70811462402344
1154/28840	Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked DArtagn	45.307960510253906
1155/28840	I foresee in it the aid of powerful	495.81292724609375
1156/28840	That may be done if they can separate the king from his	79.32734680175781
1157/28840	You Aramis know Anne of Austria better than I	50.21793746948242
1158/28840	Perhaps you are right said Aramis thoughtfully therefore I shall not pledge	27.910869598388672
1159/28840	To them or to us do you mean Aramis   To no	25.43967056274414
1160/28840	What have I to do with politics I am not obliged to read any brev	37.64570617675781
1161/28840	I have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend I shall not meddle in	80.58048248291016
1162/28840	Well listen my dear Aramis said DArtagnan your philosophy convinces me on my	16.340377807617188
1163/28840	I dont know what devil of an insect stung me and made me	82.97145080566406
1164/28840	I have a post by which I live at the death of Monsieur de Tréville who is old I may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless Gas	25.136917114257812
1165/28840	Instead of running after adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos I shall go and shoot on his	53.975162506103516
1166/28840	You know he has estatesPorthos   I should think so	50.569053649902344
1167/28840	Ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon   Good said DArtagnan to	60.02490234375
1168/28840	Then aloud   And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon   To which he adds that of Bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my tro	28.840532302856445
1169/28840	So that Porthos will be a bar	14.973880767822266
1170/28840	The Baroness Porthos will sound particularly	275.2754211425781
1171/28840	And the two friends began to	16.806306838989258
1172/28840	So DArtagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of Mazarins   Nor you of the Prince de Condé   No let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frond	28.988426208496094
1173/28840	And DArtagnan poured out a glass of	10.302553176879883
1174/28840	At all events if you want me remember the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chev	20.395198822021484
1175/28840	And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits from six in the morning to eight at night come by the	39.881187438964844
1176/28840	From eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the	51.2874755859375
1177/28840	Oh I cant let you go so I will go with	30.09010124206543
1178/28840	And he took his sword and	36.80916976928711
1179/28840	He wants to be sure that I go away said DArtagnan to	20.45556640625
1180/28840	Aramis whistled for Bazin but Bazin was asleep in the antechamber and Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake	22.23435401916504
1181/28840	Bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep	31.9091796875
1182/28840	Come come sleepy head quick the ladder   But said Bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the	76.03984069824219
1183/28840	Didnt you see that Monsieur dArtagnan mounted with difficulty It will be even more difficult to	38.37472152709961
1184/28840	DArtagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced	25.139644622802734
1185/28840	Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the	55.557098388671875
1186/28840	Presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the	81.04359436035156
1187/28840	Now then said DArtagnan this is something like this is a means of	24.63509750366211
1188/28840	A woman could go up a ladder like	170.701171875
1189/28840	Aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but DArtagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable	27.760923385620117
1190/28840	Besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his	22.317916870117188
1191/28840	In a moment he was on the	21.61075210571289
1192/28840	Stay there said Aramis I shall return	41.29977035522461
1193/28840	The two friends went toward the	88.26695251464844
1194/28840	At their approach Planchet came out leading the two	169.1483917236328
1195/28840	That is good to see said Aram	49.12614059448242
1196/28840	There is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow Bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the	65.30537414550781
1197/28840	Follow us Planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the	29.906476974487305
1198/28840	They traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses   Go then dear friend said Aramis follow your own	57.30867004394531
1199/28840	Fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your	260.9622802734375
1200/28840	As for me I remain in my humility and indol	39.46368408203125
1201/28840	What I hate today I adore tomorrow and vice	258.0224914550781
1202/28840	You see that I cannot like you for instance settle on any fixed	148.70721435546875
1203/28840	Thou liest subtile one said DArtagnan to	52.766693115234375
1204/28840	Thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealth	139.34974670410156
1205/28840	They descended into the plain by the	87.51509094238281
1206/28840	Planchet met them hard by the	89.2657241821289
1207/28840	DArtagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook	57.78351593017578
1208/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to	11.142119407653809
1209/28840	But after he had gone about two hundred steps DArtagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddlebow to fasten them to his gird	15.95617961883545
1210/28840	This is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his du	151.3223114013672
1211/28840	Stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for	86.77469635009766
1212/28840	Having thus spoken DArtagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the	46.206424713134766
1213/28840	He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent of the Jesuits an open space surrounded by a	26.849443435668945
1214/28840	The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his	68.68561553955078
1215/28840	In truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low	100.99064636230469
1216/28840	Close to the hedge the steps	194.72547912597656
1217/28840	DArtagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the	10.919320106506348
1218/28840	Two men to the astonishment of DArtagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a caval	36.03302001953125
1219/28840	Calm yourself dear Rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen	152.9417266845703
1220/28840	I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an	38.99639129638672
1221/28840	Oh answered another voice which DArtagnan instantly recognized as that of Aram	25.782058715820312
1222/28840	Be prudent sensible   I always obey madame when I am commanded by so gentle a	82.33809661865234
1223/28840	Ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft	19.92487335205078
1224/28840	Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat   Aramis rushed after the fugitive	37.167938232421875
1225/28840	DArtagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed caval	47.2121696472168
1226/28840	At that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like DArtagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light DArtagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the Duchess de Longue	35.452110290527344
1227/28840	Aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the	44.02825164794922
1228/28840	Good said DArtagnan rising and brushing his knees now I have theethou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longue	26.648744583129883
1229/28840	Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierref	6.2750067710876465
1230/28840	It was then in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that	50.78943634033203
1231/28840	At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiriesthe host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to	36.1281852722168
1232/28840	The next morning DArtagnan summoned the host one of those sly Normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct	52.91236114501953
1233/28840	DArtagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his	53.21030044555664
1234/28840	At nine in the morning he reached Nanteuil and stopped for	107.52715301513672
1235/28840	His host here was a good fellow from Picardy who gave him all the information he	56.96896743774414
1236/28840	The Bracieux estate was a few leagues from VillarsCottere	8.983816146850586
1237/28840	DArtagnan was acquainted with VillarsCotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time VillarsCotterets was a royal	16.773738861083984
1238/28840	He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin d	64.2425537109375
1239/28840	There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that Porthos was not at Bracie	13.90174388885498
1240/28840	He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds and resided on his new	13.992612838745117
1241/28840	The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed	55.43335723876953
1242/28840	It is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after	65.0973129272461
1243/28840	There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry	49.987735748291016
1244/28840	Accordingly DArtagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for	54.054141998291016
1245/28840	It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by DArtagn	41.03553771972656
1246/28840	It was nearly eight oclock when they set out	22.843666076660156

1252/28840	At the extremity of the wood DArtagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal	20.050203323364258
1253/28840	Oh oh he said I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of	78.34844207763672

1358/28840	You say then he continued that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal   Yes and the queen	44.02530288696289

1399/28840	Besides which in a short time resumed DArtagnan We shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great	50.38796615600586
1400/28840	I have your word then   Yes tis	30.974842071533203
1401/28840	I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin but   But   But he must make me a bar	48.00493621826172
1402/28840	Zounds said DArtagnan thats settled already I will be responsible for the bar	61.340877532958984
1403/28840	On this promise being given Porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the	73.13735961914062
1404/28840	As they returned toward the castle DArtagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has	47.48969268798828
1405/28840	Whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie	426.75885009765625
1406/28840	When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton	25.443138122558594
1407/28840	The face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute fel	77.79415893554688
1408/28840	Here is what I am looking for thought DArtagnan but alas the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which I am	24.92154312133789
1409/28840	He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to	15.943380355834961
1410/28840	Sir said the servant I have a favour to ask	16.70507049560547
1411/28840	Perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me   Art thou happy friend asked DArtagn	31.456661224365234
1412/28840	As happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than I	87.50086975097656
1413/28840	Well speak if it depends on	90.05186462402344
1414/28840	Oh sir it depends on you	133.244873046875
1415/28840	Sir the favor I have to ask of you is not to call me Mousqueton but M	42.641902923583984
1416/28840	Since I have had the honor of being my lords steward I have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect	35.589080810546875
1417/28840	You sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of	88.9775619506836
1418/28840	DArtagnan smiled Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names Mousqueton to cut his	41.252845764160156
1419/28840	Well my dear Mouston he said rest	105.67289733886719
1420/28840	I will call thee Mouston and if it makes thee happy I will not tutoyer you any	37.722076416015625
1421/28840	Oh cried Mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor I shall be grateful all my life it is too much to	42.23405838012695
1422/28840	Alas thought DArtagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed	25.75524139404297
1423/28840	Will monsieur remain long with us asked Mousqueton with a serene and glowing count	32.212158203125
1424/28840	I go tomorrow my friend replied DArtagn	26.36542510986328
1425/28840	Ah monsieur said Mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our	22.24481964111328
1426/28840	I fear that is true said DArtagnan in a low	7.353140354156494
1427/28840	What time is it then   Eh why it is after one o	61.17190170288086
1428/28840	Your home is a paradise Porthos one takes no note of	151.9652862548828
1429/28840	I follow you though I am not	43.04444885253906
1430/28840	Come if one cant always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor Athos the truth of which I have discovered since I began to be	68.45804595947266
1431/28840	DArtagnan who as a Gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of Athoss maxim but he did his best to keep up with his	34.74008560180664
1432/28840	He could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of	233.10733032226562
1433/28840	But he said Mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active	51.20779037475586
1434/28840	That may be true replied Porthos but I am used to him and besides he wouldnt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so	33.83091735839844
1435/28840	And you asked Porthos havent you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligentwhat then is his name   Planchetyes I have found him again but he is lackey no	48.954410552978516
1436/28840	Ah he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards How does it happen then that he is in your service   He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be	20.57796287536621
1437/28840	And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchets	24.363325119018555
1438/28840	Well said Porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when Planchet would rescue Rochefort and that you would protect him in it   I should not have believed him but men are changed by	37.387508392333984
1439/28840	There is nothing truer than that said Porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is	70.40070343017578
1440/28840	Taste of this it is a Spanish wine which our friend Athos thought much	115.95663452148438
1441/28840	At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been	62.62240219116211
1442/28840	Tell me Mouston said Porthos are my arms in good condition   Your arms my lordwhat arms   Zounds my	56.555419921875

1450/28840	Polish up or make some one else polish my	264.9339599609375
1451/28840	Then take pistols with thee and a hunting	212.79559326171875
1452/28840	Are we then going to travel my lord asked Mousqueton rather	47.98857879638672
1453/28840	An expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into l	191.49603271484375
1454/28840	We are going to return to the service Mouston replied Porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long	37.42178726196289
1455/28840	Into the servicethe kings service Mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at DArtagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost	38.406585693359375
1456/28840	We shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to our former	134.41439819335938
1457/28840	These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunder	46.86408996582031
1458/28840	It was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the	91.60738372802734
1459/28840	The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the	50.79911422729492
1460/28840	Oh said DArtagnan we dont now make war as we did	35.023494720458984
1461/28840	Today its a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask Planc	114.41023254394531
1462/28840	Mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of DArtagn	37.759193420410156
1463/28840	But he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being	137.91073608398438
1464/28840	The deuce they do said Mousqueton I think I should like the siege of Rochelle better than this war then   Porthos meantime asked DArtagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his	22.971702575683594
1465/28840	Four days replied his friend are necessary to reach Blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to	78.98657989501953
1466/28840	Set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the Hotel de la Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and there await	19.142057418823242
1467/28840	As to myself I shall go around to see Athos for though I dont think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said DArtagn	89.93805694580078
1468/28840	The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of Pierrefonds to which Porthos escorted his	20.397003173828125
1469/28840	At least DArtagnan said to himself as he took the road to VillarsCotterets at least I shall not be alone in my	16.968950271606445
1470/28840	That devil Porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if Athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis that little coxcomb with his too good	45.587646484375
1471/28840	At VillarsCotterets he wrote to the cardinal   My LordI have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty	32.03384780883789
1472/28840	I am just setting out for Bl	44.61688232421875
1473/28840	The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne in the environs of that	10.000028610229492
1474/28840	He had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his	28.95170021057129
1475/28840	It was many years since DArtagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated	76.2112045288086
1476/28840	Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound	40.614585876464844
1477/28840	Without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that DArtagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of Bl	40.046966552734375
1478/28840	Going along DArtagnan shaking his head said   I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd but still I owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of	45.844364166259766
1479/28840	Oh Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman said Planchet was he not Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles	59.83403396606445
1480/28840	I was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying Oh Tis a noble gentlemanMonsieur Ath	77.5353012084961
1481/28840	Yes true as Gospel said DArtagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine	33.95400619506836
1482/28840	I remember well said Planchet he was fond of drinkingin truth he drank but not as other men	112.83637237548828
1483/28840	One seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say Come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrow	68.52633666992188
1484/28840	And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle There was no one like him for	69.49397277832031
1485/28840	And now replied DArtagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits	38.72271728515625
1486/28840	God knows Planchet that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de la Fere whom we loved so	34.80033493041992
1487/28840	Planchet shook his head and said	9.284238815307617
1488/28840	It was evident that he shared his masters apprehens	33.57891845703125
1489/28840	Probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that I have heard described at Chamb	68.73961639404297
1490/28840	A man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the	42.38751220703125
1491/28840	Whats your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de lUnivers	47.176727294921875
1492/28840	We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagn	8.170181274414062
1493/28840	The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered	60.400299072265625
1494/28840	Gentlemen he said the wood that I am carting is his I cut it in his copse and I am taking it to the chate	101.06324005126953
1495/28840	DArtagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to Planc	22.782155990600586
1496/28840	He had a heavy handdear old Athosafter	256.7561340332031
1497/28840	DArtagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a	48.81926345825195
1498/28840	He checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep	51.69327926635742
1499/28840	On beholding this house DArtagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of	53.94931411743164
1500/28840	He proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the	90.72820281982422
1501/28840	Through the gate was seen kitchengardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the	53.363182067871094
1502/28840	This cannot be the establishment of Ath	64.94164276123047
1503/28840	Good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his	71.6060562133789
1504/28840	Alight Planchet and inquire for I confess that I have scarcely courage so to	86.72166442871094
1505/28840	Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here asked Planc	12.802323341369629
1506/28840	Yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to Planchet who was not in l	32.6491813659668
1507/28840	A nobleman retired from service is he not  	88.82817077636719
1508/28840	And who had a lackey named Grimaud persisted Planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much	29.586414337158203
1509/28840	Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine Planchet from head to	50.784423828125
1510/28840	Then cried Planchet joyously I see well that it is the same Comte de la Fere whom we	20.58023452758789
1511/28840	Be good enough to open to me for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet	37.24717712402344
1512/28840	Why didnt you say so said the servitor opening the	48.68966293334961
1513/28840	But where is your master   He is following	30.78475570678711
1514/28840	The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet who made a sign to DArtagn	16.79291534423828
1515/28840	The latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismount	31.164377212524414
1516/28840	He vaulted hastily from his horse whilst Planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the	32.59312057495117
1517/28840	But I know you my lad said Athos appearing on the	47.85609817504883
1518/28840	Oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and I know	9.93566608428955
1519/28840	I am PlanchetPlanchet whom you know	16.4172420501709
1520/28840	But the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected	81.61727905273438
1521/28840	What Planchet is Monsieur dArtagnan here   Here I am my friend dear Athos cried DArtagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from	13.194737434387207
1522/28840	At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of Ath	66.02269744873047
1523/28840	He rushed toward DArtagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his	22.312292098999023
1524/28840	DArtagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his	84.72099304199219
1525/28840	Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawingroom where there were several	21.10881996154785
1526/28840	I present to you he said Monsieur le Chevalier DArtagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that I have ever	15.929094314575195
1527/28840	DArtagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at Ath	23.268953323364258
1528/28840	Strange Athos was scarcely aged at all His fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than	75.94685363769531
1529/28840	His face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish	114.26007843017578
1530/28840	His hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by Titian and Vandy	105.61834716796875
1531/28840	Meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment   Ah tis Raoul who is come	34.30976104736328
1532/28840	Athos as the name of Raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at DArtagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his	24.594850540161133
1533/28840	But DArtagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet	44.83600997924805
1534/28840	Nevertheless DArtagnan was struck by the appearance of this new person	22.118715286254883
1535/28840	It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated	66.15454864501953
1536/28840	Here you are home again Raoul said the com	92.73616027832031
1537/28840	Yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and I have performed the commission that you gave	42.11555862426758
1538/28840	But whats the matter Raoul said Athos very anx	48.03108215332031
1539/28840	Sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little	21.02741241455078
1540/28840	To Mademoiselle de la Valliere asked Athos	18.76605987548828
1541/28840	What is it cried many persons	390.756591796875
1542/28840	She was walking with her nurse Marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback I	89.16754150390625
1543/28840	She saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise	50.80376434326172
1544/28840	I fear that she has badly sprained her	48.74189758300781

1551/28840	The guests now all took leave of Athos excepting the old Duc de Barbe who as an old friend of the family of La Valliere went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his	49.631072998046875
1552/28840	She will be the sooner with her	102.28678131103516
1553/28840	As for you Raoul I am sure it is your fault some giddiness or	36.869384765625
1554/28840	No sir I assure you muttered Raoul it is	27.07012367248535
1555/28840	Oh no no I declare it is not cried the young girl while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her	49.7564582824707
1556/28840	Nevertheless Raoul you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de SaintR	28.550966262817383
1557/28840	Whilst this scene was going on DArtagnan remained with open mouth and a confused	75.30155944824219
1558/28840	Everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with	51.65483856201172
1559/28840	Athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the	35.8713493347168
1560/28840	Whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared	162.03085327148438
1561/28840	True monsieur le comte replied DArtagnan who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over	17.301111221313477
1562/28840	First and foremost dear DArtagnan we have no title such as count	76.42992401123047
1563/28840	When I call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you	46.6313362121582
1564/28840	But to you DArtagnan I am I hope still dear Athos your comrade your	39.830718994140625
1565/28840	Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were   Oh God forbid   Then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each	30.033199310302734
1566/28840	You are surprised at what you see here   Extreme	25.67360496520996
1567/28840	But above all things I am a marvel to you   I confess	43.45884323120117
1568/28840	I am still young am I not Should you not have known me again in spite of my eightandforty years of age   On the contrary I do not find you the same person at	27.15679168701172
1569/28840	I understand cried Athos with a gentle	67.86780548095703
1570/28840	Everything DArtagnan even folly has its	70.82270050048828
1571/28840	Then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own I presume You have a park and horses	244.86947631835938
1572/28840	Yes I inherited this little property when I quitted the army as I told	34.063106536865234
1573/28840	The park is twenty acrestwenty comprising kitchengardens and a	52.85249710083008
1574/28840	I have two horsesI do not count my servants bobtailed n	62.656394958496094
1575/28840	My sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two set	91.4971923828125
1576/28840	But then all this extravagance is not for myself added Athos	51.49150085449219
1577/28840	Yes I see for the young man Raoul said DArtagn	18.229095458984375
1578/28840	You guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country	91.61541748046875
1579/28840	It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see I was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to	89.4659652709961
1580/28840	This child has caused me to recover what I had	58.71794128417969
1581/28840	I had no longer any wish to live for myself I have lived for	28.58656883239746
1582/28840	I have corrected the vices that I had I have assumed the virtues that I had	42.23912811279297
1583/28840	I may be mistaken but I believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could	72.65233612060547
1584/28840	The remembrance of Milady recurred to DArtagn	20.4074764251709
1585/28840	And you are happy he said to his	41.960269927978516
1586/28840	As happy as it is allowed to one of Gods creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think DArtagnan for you have not yet done	52.887298583984375
1587/28840	You are too bad Athos one can hide nothing from you answered DArtagn	32.73115158081055
1588/28840	I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling   Remorse I finish your	56.072509765625
1589/28840	I do not feel remorse because that woman I profoundly hold deserved her	81.63615417480469
1590/28840	Had she one redeeming trait I doubt	379.3865966796875
1591/28840	I do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of	76.44530487060547
1592/28840	But I do not mean my friend that we were right in what we	36.732967376708984
1593/28840	Hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish	240.28616333007812
1594/28840	I have sometimes thought as you do Ath	74.63768005371094
1595/28840	She had a son that unhappy woman  	75.55724334716797
1596/28840	Have you ever heard of him  	51.15359878540039
1597/28840	He must be about twentythree years of age said Athos in a low	9.630510330200195
1598/28840	I often think of that young man DArtagn	13.54525375366211
1599/28840	Strange for I had forgotten him said the	47.273197174072266
1600/28840	And Lord de Winterdo you know anything about him   I know that he is in high favor with Charles	19.17109489440918
1601/28840	The fortunes of that monarch now are at low	410.10150146484375
1602/28840	He shed the blood of Strafford that confirms what I said just nowblood will have	80.16014862060547
1603/28840	And the queen   What queen   Madame Henrietta of England daughter of Henry	19.639318466186523
1604/28840	She is at the Louvre as you	24.505558013916016
1605/28840	Yes and I hear in bitter	117.549560546875
1606/28840	Her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in	161.68052673339844
1607/28840	Do you grasp that said Athos shrugging his shoulders the daughter of Henry	19.50814437866211
1608/28840	shivering for want of a fagot Why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from Mazarin She should have wanted	114.50099182128906
1609/28840	Have you ever seen the queen of England inquired DArtagn	24.38797378540039
1610/28840	No but my mother as a child saw	81.74058532714844
1611/28840	Did I ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici  	46.111663818359375
1612/28840	You know Athos you never spoke much of such	139.9103546142578
1613/28840	Ah mon Dieu yes you are right Athos replied but then there must be some occasion for	40.30732345581055
1614/28840	Porthos wouldnt have waited for it so patiently said DArtagnan with a	17.56353187561035
1615/28840	Every one according to his nature my dear DArtagn	22.957712173461914
1616/28840	Porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent	88.46183013916016
1617/28840	I sometimes wonder replied Athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound	72.55232238769531
1618/28840	Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts DArtagn	407.8636474609375
1619/28840	Believe me it is only the evilminded who deny friendship they cannot understand	167.6275634765625
1620/28840	And Aramis   I have seen him also said DArtagnan but he seemed to me	15.055363655090332
1621/28840	Ah you have seen Aramis said Athos turning on DArtagnan a searching	18.36659049987793
1622/28840	Why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the Temple of Friendship as the poets would	39.36399459838867
1623/28840	Aramis you know continued Athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with	57.44732666015625
1624/28840	I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said DArtagn	15.827702522277832
1625/28840	Athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of	86.7242660522461
1626/28840	You see said he calling DArtagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my	32.043121337890625
1627/28840	All is charming and everything savors of nobility replied DArtagn	34.79982376098633
1628/28840	At this instant they heard the sound of horses	43.32723617553711
1629/28840	Tis Raoul who has come back said Athos and we can now hear how the poor child	29.862154006958008
1630/28840	In fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and DArtagn	22.193286895751953
1631/28840	Monsieur said Athos placing his hand on DArtagnans shoulder monsieur is the Chevalier DArtagnan of whom you have often heard me speak Ra	11.23888111114502
1632/28840	Monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous	29.149263381958008
1633/28840	That little compliment could not fail to move DArtagn	39.067562103271484
1634/28840	But he will make it up in you I am	55.5676383972168
1635/28840	I like your manner Raoul and your politeness has touched	49.42872619628906
1636/28840	Athos was more delighted than can be	133.48385620117188
1637/28840	He looked at DArtagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive	17.629146575927734
1638/28840	Now said DArtagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance I am sure of	17.862409591674805
1639/28840	I hope the accident has been of no consequence   They dont yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been	72.35939025878906
1640/28840	At this moment a little boy half peasant half footboy came to announce	104.04833221435547
1641/28840	Athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hothouse full of magnificent	51.26026153564453
1642/28840	The plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the	139.32302856445312
1643/28840	DArtagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of	29.272464752197266
1644/28840	Yes a chef doeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini replied Ath	25.627626419067383
1645/28840	What battle does it represent   That of Marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to Francis	80.26380157470703
1646/28840	It was on that occasion that my ancestor Enguerrand de la Fere was made a knight of the Order of	21.555315017700195
1647/28840	Michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of work	78.4240951538086
1648/28840	Men were giants in those times said Athos now we are pigmies in	47.83061599731445
1649/28840	Call Charles he added addressing the boy who	158.12155151367188
1650/28840	My good Charles I particularly recommend to your care Planchet the laquais of Monsieur DArtagn	37.62723922729492
1651/28840	He likes good wine now you have the key of the	88.49845123291016
1652/28840	He has slept a long time on a hard bed so he wont object to a soft one take every care of him I beg of	97.67121124267578
1653/28840	You think of everything said DArtagnan and I thank you for Planchet my dear Ath	13.30008602142334
1654/28840	Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus	58.26610565185547
1655/28840	My friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when I hear	71.78868865966797
1656/28840	Tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to	66.3224868774414
1657/28840	What do you mean sir inquired Ra	19.522459030151367
1658/28840	He was eighteen only three years older than you are Raoul when I saw him set to work pitted against tried	63.464141845703125
1659/28840	And did Monsieur DArtagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening	30.043930053710938
1660/28840	I killed one man if I recollect rightly replied DArtagnan with a look of inquiry directed to Athos another I disarmed or wounded I dont remember	46.37687683105469
1661/28840	Wounded said Athos it was a phenomenon of	54.171573638916016
1662/28840	The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need rep	64.77831268310547
1663/28840	DArtagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but Athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by Ra	27.16904640197754
1664/28840	DArtagnan retired to bednot to sleep but to think over all he had heard that	46.78240203857422
1665/28840	Being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for Athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunk	121.06471252441406
1666/28840	He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his	120.62493133544922
1667/28840	Nevertheless it seemed to him that Athos was not in all respects sincere and	31.256956100463867
1668/28840	It was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that Athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenants	35.1049690246582
1669/28840	He could not help thinking of	29.656972885131836
1670/28840	The clear and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would	104.64765167236328
1671/28840	He would enter into the ministers schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by	74.35693359375
1672/28840	Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day DArtagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after	45.30244064331055
1673/28840	He determined to cultivate the goodwill of the youth Raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the	97.25137329101562
1674/28840	But DArtagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of Ath	42.11421203613281
1675/28840	Besides to tell truth whilst DArtagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos truehearted open Ath	40.57789611816406
1676/28840	It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that Athos on the contrary would despise	33.97583770751953
1677/28840	Ah why is not Grimaud the taciturn Grimaud here thought DArtagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence   There reigned a perfect stillness in the	67.69352722167969
1678/28840	DArtagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn	40.23407745361328
1679/28840	At last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen	78.98243713378906
1680/28840	Not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber aboveas he supposed the bedroom of Ath	54.04057312011719
1681/28840	He is walking about and thinking thought DArtagnan but of what It is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not	40.8038330078125
1682/28840	At length Athos went to bed apparently for the noise	109.22978210449219
1683/28840	Silence and fatigue together overcame DArtagnan and sleep overtook him	111.7294921875
1684/28840	He was not however a good	82.79424285888672
1685/28840	Scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the	118.6858139038086
1686/28840	Somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealth	420.64410400390625
1687/28840	True to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know DArtagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of Ra	66.18721008300781
1688/28840	The young man was opening the door of the	35.6059455871582
1689/28840	The road as DArtagnan had observed was the way to Bl	34.88011169433594
1690/28840	So thought the Gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who doesnt at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair	102.53846740722656
1691/28840	Hes not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms hes not going on a message for he goes	111.93580627441406
1692/28840	Why does he go in secret Is he afraid of me or of his father for I am sure the count is his	36.65925598144531
1693/28840	By Jove I shall know about that soon for I shall soon speak out to Ath	60.49570846557617
1694/28840	Day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the	37.375648498535156

1696/28840	The latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the	168.52430725097656
1697/28840	The Gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went	50.34375
1698/28840	Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the	42.337093353271484
1699/28840	Goodday to you have you slept well   Excellently Athos but what are you looking for You are perhaps a tulip fancier   My dear friend if I am you must not laugh at me for being	48.45237731933594
1700/28840	In the country people alter one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that God causes to spring from the earth which are despised in	167.18724060058594
1701/28840	I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this	55.48225784301758
1702/28840	These gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water theyve allowed him to walk over the	118.64698791503906
1703/28840	Ah you think so do you   And he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were	62.7180290222168

1714/28840	You do not make Raoul work so he takes his own way of employing	94.29967498779297
1715/28840	Exactly therefore I think of sending him away from	82.75662994384766

1742/28840	Athos was for a few moments	70.54840087890625
1743/28840	Good DArtagnan is for Mazarin he said to	18.852270126342773
1744/28840	From that moment he grew very	227.18150329589844
1745/28840	On his side DArtagnan became more cautious	41.45952224731445

1754/28840	And what makes me all the more wretched sir is that I was the cause of this	59.46022415161133

1759/28840	They breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor Raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at	87.63723754882812
1760/28840	The other was in a feminine hand long and	290.3800964355469
1761/28840	Come said DArtagnan to Raoul seeing that Athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse	19.290864944458008
1762/28840	And they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing	59.220420837402344
1763/28840	In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles brought in a letter for DArtagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly	31.26150894165039
1764/28840	It was now Athoss turn to take a sly	124.09658813476562
1765/28840	DArtagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head   See dear friend what it is to belong to the	21.851316452026367
1766/28840	Faith you are indeed right not to return to	47.60496139526367

1768/28840	Egad yes but why dont you come there also   Athos colored a little and answered   Should I go I shall be delighted to see you	37.50519561767578

1770/28840	Then turning to Athos he added   I seem to miss something	60.1563606262207

1774/28840	The friends embraced cordially DArtagnan pressed Raouls	30.572412490844727
1775/28840	Will you not come with me he said I shall pass by Bl	42.450923919677734
1776/28840	Raoul turned toward Athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to	25.274885177612305
1777/28840	No monsieur replied the young man I will remain with monsieur le com	6.861163139343262
1778/28840	Adieu then to both my good friends said DArtagnan may God preserve you as we used to say when we said goodbye to each other in the late cardinals	33.03608703613281
1779/28840	Athos waved his hand Raoul bowed and DArtagnan and Planchet set	13.588010787963867
1780/28840	The count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said   Raoul we set out tonight for	29.052780151367188
1781/28840	Eh cried the young man turning	13.289413452148438
1782/28840	You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de SaintR	25.356069564819336
1783/28840	I shall wait for you here till	49.00710678100586
1784/28840	The young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his	29.30144691467285
1785/28840	As to DArtagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again   Return immediately to	28.415006637573242
1786/28840	The epistle is laconic said DArtagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably I should not have understood it but happily there is a post	24.11631965637207
1787/28840	And he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the	38.36802673339844
1788/28840	Go to the kings treasurer at Blois tell him your name and show him this letter you will receive two hundred pist	32.948368072509766
1789/28840	Assuredly said DArtagnan I admire this piece of	91.2779541015625
1790/28840	The cardinal writes better than I	124.7151870727539
1791/28840	Come Planchet let us pay a visit to the kings treasurer and then set	15.710142135620117
1792/28840	Toward Paris sir   Toward	235.9384765625
1793/28840	And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could	128.22535705566406
1794/28840	There was a dispute among the	111.11663055419922
1795/28840	I tell you one of them was saying that if Coysel predicted that tis as good as true I know nothing about it but I have heard say that hes not only an astrologer but a	38.96894454956055
1796/28840	Deuce take it friend if hes one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying	122.65069580078125
1797/28840	Why   Because he may be tried for	28.44805908203125
1798/28840	Ah absurd they dont burn sorcerers	165.2159881591797
1799/28840	No Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier	32.20588302612305
1800/28840	My friend Urban Grandier wasnt a sorcerer he was a learned	74.20099639892578
1801/28840	He didnt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous	174.84933471679688
1802/28840	Mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same	157.19288635253906
1803/28840	I dont say resumed the guard that Coysel is not a sorcerer but I say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming	81.85432434082031
1804/28840	How so   Why in this way if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not	43.762001037597656
1805/28840	He was an Italian and therefore superst	39.635093688964844
1806/28840	He walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were	32.213932037353516
1807/28840	What were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that Monsieur de Beaufort had escaped were you not   Oh no my lord said the incredulous	28.824853897094727

1810/28840	My lord said the guard I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsunt	80.33628845214844
1811/28840	Coysel is a madman returned the	136.400390625
1812/28840	Well the queen has not only one son but two then Monsieur de Coligny was killed and   Yes said Mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal   No my lord but he will be answered the	23.637155532836914
1813/28840	After Whitsuntide it would be another	39.443058013916016

1815/28840	It has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous Mazarin was superst	59.35832977294922
1816/28840	He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should	28.653125762939453
1817/28840	The guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest	81.74507141113281
1818/28840	During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his	22.257970809936523
1819/28840	It was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry	36.18782424926758
1820/28840	especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of	45.514190673828125
1821/28840	But like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his	58.72642135620117
1822/28840	Often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of Monsieur de Beau	19.85854148864746

1828/28840	Escape my lordescape Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is   Yes I do sir in the donjon of Vinc	22.72405433654785
1829/28840	Yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my	158.05845642089844
1830/28840	Sir replied Mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watchspring one may saw through an iron	103.9324951171875

1833/28840	No no cried Mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his	63.850303649902344
1834/28840	He then asked with whom he	187.2638702392578
1835/28840	My lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with	104.35499572753906
1836/28840	But does he not approach the walls while playing   Your eminence doesnt know those walls they are sixty feet high and I doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping	51.08620834350586
1837/28840	Hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more	96.85458374023438
1838/28840	You mean to say then my dear Monsieur la Ramee   That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird I will continue answerable for	28.635635375976562
1839/28840	Take care you assert a great deal said Maz	91.34932708740234
1840/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of	32.309303283691406
1841/28840	My lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long	162.9645233154297
1842/28840	Come come not such a fool as I fancied thought Maz	91.61602783203125
1843/28840	Besides my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes continued La Ramee and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beau	7.747114181518555
1844/28840	Yes but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes	10.163932800292969

1849/28840	And who is this Cerberus   A certain Monsieur Grimaud my	29.704145431518555
1850/28840	And what was he before he went to Vincennes   He was in the country as I was told by the person who recommended him to	23.56640625

1867/28840	But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the	45.89422607421875
1868/28840	After having failed in poetry Monsieur de Beaufort tried	75.76043701171875
1869/28840	He drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb Maz	44.616127014160156
1870/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny the governor of Vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath	23.07810401916504
1871/28840	The next day the prisoners room was full of pictures and mott	56.57265853881836
1872/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of	61.59770202636719
1873/28840	de Beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat	83.07735443115234
1874/28840	The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawingpaper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarins	37.011085510253906
1875/28840	The governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that	53.6212272644043
1876/28840	To this Monsieur de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a Bayard he would become a Raphael or a Michael	37.13957595825195
1877/28840	Nevertheless one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly	67.85550689697266
1878/28840	His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keep	141.53878784179688
1879/28840	With this animal which he called Pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its	122.08255767822266
1880/28840	At last when Pistache was sufficiently well trained Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his	37.11565017700195
1881/28840	The party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the	37.217037200927734
1882/28840	Having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over	56.08547592163086

1884/28840	Nothing could be better done a sundial could not have shown the hour with greater	89.3529052734375
1885/28840	Then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in	55.33527755737305
1886/28840	Then the duke put to Pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world   Pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and	54.66202163696289
1887/28840	de Beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what I ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his	282.3213195800781

1889/28840	Then said the prisoner lets think who it can	147.09454345703125
1890/28840	Can it be can it possibly be the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina hey   Pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times success	42.85179901123047
1891/28840	Gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the Illustrious Coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to Pist	43.72068405151367
1892/28840	Let us go on to another of his	148.56398010253906

1894/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beau	6.605548858642578
1895/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one	29.958402633666992

1897/28840	But interposed Monsieur de Chavigny it seems to me that Pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de P	25.2574520111084
1898/28840	Stop said the duke Pistache jump for the	33.42437744140625
1899/28840	And he raised his cane six inches	62.67826461791992
1900/28840	The dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over	79.07283782958984
1901/28840	And now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the	42.61277389526367
1902/28840	The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the	103.93721008300781
1903/28840	Now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground Pistache my friend jump for the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Pisc	23.941591262817383
1904/28840	The dog turned his back to the	64.96666717529297
1905/28840	What asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pist	31.37670135498047
1906/28840	But Pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the	67.97468566894531
1907/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time Pistaches patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his	24.376253128051758
1908/28840	Three days afterward Pistache was found deadpoison	92.74942779541016
1909/28840	Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned	43.61879348754883
1910/28840	This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him	71.6792984008789
1911/28840	So it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as t	65.96495819091797
1912/28840	Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent Pist	72.22357940673828
1913/28840	De Chavigny who according to report was a son of Richelieus and had been a creature of the late cardinals understood	31.379179000854492
1914/28840	He took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at Vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting	31.88876724243164
1915/28840	A fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future	54.79754638671875
1916/28840	One morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial	32.675540924072266
1917/28840	Now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beau	33.50971984863281
1918/28840	He assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows   Gentlemen will you permit a grandson of Henry	60.20253372192383
1919/28840	to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy   Odds fish as my grandfather used to say I once reigned in Paris do you know that I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my	59.70065689086914
1920/28840	The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the	50.192657470703125
1921/28840	Gentlemen and citizens set me free I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Maz	88.90347290039062
1922/28840	I will make you all captains with good pensions Odds fish On march forward   But eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of Henry	40.560951232910156
1923/28840	did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so Monsieur de Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the	48.64046859741211
1924/28840	Sometimes when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians all fully armed appear at Vincennes to deliver him from	27.39728355407715
1925/28840	My lord answered De Chavigny with a low bow I have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand	40.310813903808594
1926/28840	I should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexpl	161.63072204589844
1927/28840	Yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken I should be obliged to let them hang youat which I should be most unhappy	65.08744049072266
1928/28840	And in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavign	8.138529777526855
1929/28840	And once more he bowed low before his high	55.508426666259766
1930/28840	These bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus   Monsieur de Chavigny turning toward the door used to call out Halloo La Ramee   La Ramee came into the	23.556194305419922
1931/28840	La Ramee I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an	64.63665771484375
1932/28840	La Ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper the shadow of his person but La Rameegay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the dukes eyeshis incorrupt	119.96831512451172
1933/28840	Now although La Ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry	39.9176025390625
1934/28840	hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his	41.62395477294922
1935/28840	One may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and	42.52677917480469
1936/28840	La Ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the mo	30.26138687133789
1937/28840	Twas too brief an enjoyment and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of	52.662452697753906
1938/28840	But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second	104.10833740234375
1939/28840	Grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of Vinc	77.2977523803711
1940/28840	He addressed about twelve words to him Grimaud answered in	288.6582946777344
1941/28840	Heres a promising fellow and it is I who have found out his merits said Monsieur de Chavign	19.92758560180664

1943/28840	Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a	274.65576171875
1944/28840	So after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply La Ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged Grim	70.6883773803711
1945/28840	They are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keep	79.96167755126953
1946/28840	Good answered Grimaud and he went right to the	38.07883834838867
1947/28840	The duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach Mazarin with his wretched appearance and	40.88410186767578
1948/28840	The comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing	140.43992614746094
1949/28840	As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the teatable he took it up and as he took it he made a low	41.58726119995117
1950/28840	The duke looked at this strange figure with	55.731895446777344

1952/28840	Ho hey whats that cried the d	160.80125427246094
1953/28840	Who is this creature   Grimaud did not answer but bowed a second	31.676904678344727
1954/28840	Grimaud made a sign that he was	56.770301818847656

1961/28840	Grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word Point	86.572509765625

1967/28840	A fresh practical joke now occurred to the d	113.35397338867188
1968/28840	The day was employed in preparations for the	78.56808471679688
1969/28840	Every one grows childish in prison but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was particularly disposed to become	25.101821899414062
1970/28840	In the course of his mornings walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted	70.90483856201172
1971/28840	When he came home he formed his handkerchief into a	61.497066497802734
1972/28840	Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud but La Ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his	37.20262145996094
1973/28840	The guards looked on it with	186.49911499023438
1974/28840	Who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frown	42.30718994140625
1975/28840	Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done	49.65876770019531
1976/28840	What thou again Why didst thou take it   Yeswhy asked La Rame	40.74498748779297
1977/28840	Grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said	77.36013793945312
1978/28840	I will shape it out for you with my	46.5313835144043
1979/28840	And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as	41.6280632019043

1981/28840	La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a	31.856842041015625
1982/28840	Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with	30.19274139404297
1983/28840	La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus Grimaud however did not even	98.58099365234375

1986/28840	La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the	23.0185546875
1987/28840	He was going to throw the crawfish out also when Grimaud snatched it from his	46.04164123535156
1988/28840	Good to eat he said and put it in his	47.44923400878906
1989/28840	This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his	64.99653625488281
1990/28840	But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even	46.776390075683594
1991/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate	23.992431640625
1992/28840	The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the more and more odious to	78.59576416015625
1993/28840	One morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when Grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the	39.38932418823242
1994/28840	You are insupportable cried the duke I shall beat	33.33159255981445

1997/28840	And he extended his hands toward Grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind	36.52599334716797
1998/28840	At the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone   Hush smiling as he uttered the	34.43684005737305
1999/28840	A gesture a smile and a word from Grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short ast	72.26698303222656
2000/28840	Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a	63.943626403808594

2012/28840	Whereupon Grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to	19.237009048461914
2013/28840	Here is what you are looking for he	51.26345443725586
2014/28840	The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimauds hands but Grimaud shook his	52.601802825927734
2015/28840	Thank you monseigneur he said drawing back I am	97.29566955566406
2016/28840	The duke went from one surprise to	124.91969299316406
2017/28840	Grimaud drew near and kissed it	243.54360961914062
2018/28840	The grand manner of Athos had left its mark on Grim	100.9968032836914
2019/28840	What shall we do and when and how proceed   It is now eleven answered Grim	72.65462493896484
2020/28840	Let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramp	29.837158203125
2021/28840	And then   Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back	36.61671829223633
2022/28840	Grimaud made a sign that he was going	51.00221252441406
2023/28840	Ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me   I wish my lord would make me one	25.76393699645996
2024/28840	True on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost	33.55582809448242
2025/28840	Now resumed Grimaud Ive only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest	44.71617889404297
2026/28840	At this moment La Ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the	29.286705017089844
2027/28840	The duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his	48.3288459777832
2028/28840	La Ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward	32.76948165893555
2029/28840	Then turning to Grimaud   Very good my friend very	38.14298629760742
2030/28840	You have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon I hope have news that will be agreeable to	62.68454360961914
2031/28840	Grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his	188.3195343017578
2032/28840	Well my lord said La Ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow   So tis you La Ramee in faith tis time you came back	35.1107292175293
2033/28840	I threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that I mightnt break my promise and strangle Grim	43.81882095336914
2034/28840	I doubt however said La Ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your high	38.8549919128418
2035/28840	Pardieu you are righta mute from the East I swear it was time for you to come back La Ramee and I was eager to see you	25.705060958862305
2036/28840	Monseigneur is too good said La Ramee flattered by the	26.86406135559082
2037/28840	Yes continued the duke really I feel bored today beyond the power of	66.5950927734375
2038/28840	Then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed La Rame	32.08467483520508
2039/28840	I am at your service my	9.78573989868164
2040/28840	I protest my dear La Ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that I would stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure of your	16.1248722076416
2041/28840	My lord replied La Ramee I think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be	38.16590118408203
2042/28840	What do you mean Have you seen him lately   He sent for me	22.679737091064453
2043/28840	Really to speak to you about me   Of what else do you imagine he would speak to me Really my lord you are his	30.78144645690918
2044/28840	Ah La Ramee if you would but accept my offers I would make your	46.19681167602539
2045/28840	How you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be	130.464599609375
2046/28840	I shall no sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of	33.214569091796875
2047/28840	Pshaw pshaw I cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king I see my lord I shall be obliged to fetch a second Grimaud   Very well let us say no more about	39.88169860839844
2048/28840	Monseigneur I see well that I must call Grim	54.137149810791016
2049/28840	And what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me   I admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre	50.356021881103516
2050/28840	What did he say to me He told me to watch	42.55610275268555
2051/28840	And why so why watch me asked the duke uneas	59.86225891113281
2052/28840	Because an astrologer had predicted that you would	87.49214935302734
2053/28840	Ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of	28.388442993164062
2054/28840	Oh mon Dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest	116.73665618896484
2055/28840	And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence   That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not to buy	56.22080612182617
2056/28840	Why not   Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a	58.27771759033203
2057/28840	Let us go and have a game at tennis La Rame	25.143342971801758
2058/28840	My lordI beg your highnesss pardonbut I must beg for half an hours leave of	70.71106719970703
2059/28840	Why   Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to	25.870746612548828
2060/28840	I bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor Monsieur de Chavigny though Ive been here a week has not ordered so much as a tart	51.90567398071289
2061/28840	But I then replied probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not	41.25822067260742
2062/28840	My pastry not good Well Monsieur La Ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at	63.30302047729492
2063/28840	I cannot I replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chate	22.10163688659668
2064/28840	Very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an	38.418582916259766
2065/28840	In half an hour Yes have you breakfasted Faith	145.90933227539062
2066/28840	Well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old Burg	24.65070152282715
2067/28840	So you see my lord since I am hungry I would with your highnesss leave And La Ramee bent	37.026702880859375
2068/28840	Go then animal said the duke but remember I only allow you half an	64.56603240966797
2069/28840	May I promise your custom to the successor of Father Marteau my lord   Yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of Vincennes are fatal to my	30.98617935180664
2070/28840	La Ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a	37.76585388183594
2071/28840	But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from Madame de Montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew	30.174968719482422
2072/28840	But his confidence in Grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his	90.87220764160156
2073/28840	Pâtés made by the Successor of Father Marteau are	106.1022720336914
2074/28840	In half an hour La Ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts	54.52129364013672
2075/28840	The pates were excellent the wine	266.5536804199219
2076/28840	The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open	102.15240478515625
2077/28840	The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of	15.088078498840332
2078/28840	The peasant the gardener was Rochefort whom he believed to be in the Bast	45.20909881591797
2079/28840	Well Whos up there said the	302.317626953125
2080/28840	Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the d	76.84538269042969
2081/28840	The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by La Ramee and the	35.615447998046875
2082/28840	One however fell at the dukes feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his	32.33783721923828
2083/28840	La Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the	47.58745193481445
2084/28840	The duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books	67.11349487304688
2085/28840	La Ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not	35.344825744628906
2086/28840	Ask day after tomorrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than Noirmont your former maitre dhot	59.993309020996094
2087/28840	Do not open the pie till you are	161.20216369628906
2088/28840	I hope you will be satisfied with its	25.496267318725586
2089/28840	Your highnesss most devoted servant   In the Bastile as elsewhere   Comte de Roche	38.64773941040039
2090/28840	The duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his	96.6077651977539
2091/28840	La Ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive	60.920894622802734
2092/28840	He endeavored to cheer him up in his	80.55136108398438
2093/28840	Ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if I could but do as you do and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father Marteaus	42.695594787597656
2094/28840	Tis true my lord answered La Ramee that his pates are famous and his wine	37.11343765258789
2095/28840	In any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur de Chavign	34.222110748291016
2096/28840	Well my lord said La Ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them Besides I have promised him your	45.950927734375
2097/28840	If I am to remain here permanently as Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand I must provide myself with a diversion for my old age I must turn gour	42.560096740722656
2098/28840	My lord said La Ramee if you will take a bit of good advice dont put that off till you are	45.64891815185547
2099/28840	Good said the Duc de Beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that Master La Ramees is glutton	51.99886703491211
2100/28840	Let us then take advantage of	67.37353515625
2101/28840	Then aloud   Well my dear La Ramee the day after tomorrow is a	19.903541564941406
2102/28840	Will you give me a lesson the day after tomorrow   In what   In gastronomy   Willingly my	23.481548309326172
2103/28840	Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny well have a supper here under your	31.780593872070312
2104/28840	The proposal was seductive but La Ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to	43.25843048095703
2105/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of	15.401676177978516
2106/28840	Did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem He reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the	80.31736755371094
2107/28840	As to getting him drunk the duke couldnt hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of	96.12261962890625
2108/28840	Then an idea came to him which harmonized	94.61676788330078
2109/28840	The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his	46.577293395996094
2110/28840	But presently the exempts face suddenly bright	783.6398315429688
2111/28840	Well he asked that will do will it not   Yes my lord on one	55.856754302978516
2112/28840	What   That Grimaud shall wait on us at	55.82347106933594
2113/28840	Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim   To the devil with your Grimaud He will spoil the	70.98680877685547
2114/28840	I will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesnt speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles	74.90300750732422
2115/28840	Do you know my friend I find one thing very evident in all this you distrust	49.533958435058594
2116/28840	My lord the day after tomorrow is Pentec	39.882843017578125
2117/28840	Well what is Pentecost to me Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison   No my lord but I have already told you what that damned magician	25.188312530517578
2118/28840	And what was it   That the day of Pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of Vinc	23.201108932495117
2119/28840	You believe in sorcerers then you fool   II mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my Lord Giulio who cares about them as an Italian he is superst	69.86756896972656
2120/28840	Well then with well acted goodhumor I allow Grimaud but no one else you must manage it	66.34513854980469
2121/28840	Order whatever you like for supperthe only thing I specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his piesnot only now but when I leave my	52.51152038574219
2122/28840	Then you think you will some day leave it said La Rame	36.897457122802734
2123/28840	The devil replied the prince surely at the death of Maz	65.19286346435547
2124/28840	I am fifteen years younger than he	17.379770278930664
2125/28840	At Vincennes tis true one lives faster   My lord replied La Ramee my lord   Or dies sooner for it comes to the same	20.128250122070312
2126/28840	He stopped however at the door for an	54.75570297241211
2127/28840	Whom does your highness wish me to send to you   Any one except Grim	45.20759201049805
2128/28840	The officer of the guard then with his chessboard  	44.57742691040039
2129/28840	Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of	50.762840270996094
2130/28840	A strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a	159.27015686035156
2131/28840	The duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the fortyeight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his	69.73194122314453
2132/28840	Besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected They had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious p	77.9371109008789
2133/28840	And what friends awaited him without He had friends then after five years in prison If that were so he was indeed a highly favored	168.825439453125
2134/28840	He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered	161.5335693359375
2135/28840	It is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was	40.439815521240234
2136/28840	So the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy	100.6419677734375
2137/28840	But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one waythey killed time for him till eight oclock in the evening then would come night and with night	78.00139617919922
2138/28840	So at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him	51.15232849121094
2139/28840	The duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like	161.1292266845703
2140/28840	He dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly	177.58055114746094
2141/28840	For a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed	162.35659790039062
2142/28840	His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really	57.927772521972656
2143/28840	He fell asleep again and another vision	200.13653564453125
2144/28840	He was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave Vinc	15.424330711364746
2145/28840	Grimaud was walking before him with a	156.52391052246094
2146/28840	By degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his	102.87007141113281
2147/28840	At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to	121.94664764404297
2148/28840	The sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against	266.4458923339844
2149/28840	He made fruitless efforts to go on it was	122.07796478271484
2150/28840	Nevertheless he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front	54.94121170043945
2151/28840	He wished to call out to him but could not utter a	28.469709396362305
2152/28840	Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing	29.51894187927246
2153/28840	He was discovered all hope of flight was	233.0105438232422
2154/28840	Still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his	57.39617919921875
2155/28840	At last he heard the voice of La Rame	24.418128967285156
2156/28840	La Ramee took his hand and laughed	62.938499450683594
2157/28840	He was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which Ornano Puylaurens and his uncle had	69.38056945800781
2158/28840	Their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly	53.33647537231445
2159/28840	The duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was	34.594417572021484
2160/28840	In fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for	43.23538589477539
2161/28840	What is the matter with your highness asked La Rame	10.96519947052002
2162/28840	Tis your fault you simpleton answered the d	48.88300323486328
2163/28840	With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing	84.2160415649414

2324/28840	And therefore Marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbé and not from the good abbé	52.38838577270508
2325/28840	And that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came   It was I the Comte de la Fere said Athos rising and bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevre	25.46019744873047
2326/28840	The duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter   Ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad Marie Michon fared better than she	37.63383102416992

2328/28840	At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault mad	93.84330749511719
2329/28840	I have told you that I was traveling on an important	26.05620765686035
2330/28840	At daybreak I left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion	186.17266845703125
2331/28840	In the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her	84.10929107666016
2332/28840	Her pretty face arrested my attention I approached and recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with	277.4328308105469
2333/28840	In that way I discovered that the charming traveler was   Marie Michon said Madame de Chevreuse	31.877737045288086
2334/28840	Then I went out of the house I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey	21.904499053955078
2335/28840	And have you never revisited that village eagerly asked Madame de Chevre	44.67163848876953
2336/28840	Well   I wanted to see the good curé	30.21993064880371
2337/28840	I found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all	64.89948272705078
2338/28840	A week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 October 16	53.7454833984375
2339/28840	It was the date of that strange adventure interrupted Madame de Chevre	29.74639892578125
2340/28840	Yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his	33.29695510864258
2341/28840	You must know monsieur that Marie Michon when she returned to France in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near	46.10879135131836
2342/28840	And what said the abbé asked Ath	39.32051086425781

2346/28840	Take care madame said Athos for he knows neither his father nor his	38.94839096069336

2349/28840	Tomorrow I plunge into an adventurous affair in which I may be	74.62205505371094

2351/28840	Rest assured cried the duchess I shall do what I	28.494558334350586
2352/28840	I have but little influence now but all that I have shall most assuredly be	63.70524215698242
2353/28840	As to his title and fortune   As to that madame I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicom	24.83828353881836
2354/28840	Upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman But I am eager to see our young vicom	18.156572341918945

2356/28840	I will have him come in if you really wish	40.75917434692383
2357/28840	Athos moved toward the door the duchess held him	26.654451370239258
2358/28840	So he opened the door and beckoned the young man	14.391992568969727
2359/28840	The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to	22.666637420654297
2360/28840	Vicomte come here said Athos the duchess permits you to kiss her	52.31279754638672
2361/28840	The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevre	22.45762062072754
2362/28840	If I were I should do for you at once the most that you	99.20793914794922

2364/28840	Athos standing looked at them both with indescribable	25.927539825439453
2365/28840	Madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the	35.69625473022461
2366/28840	I have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention I believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the	24.24467658996582
2367/28840	Personally I am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between Madame de Montbazon my motherinlaw and Madame de Longue	14.749114990234375
2368/28840	But the Prince de Marsillac Yes indeed thats the right	61.82404708862305
2369/28840	The Prince de Marsillacmy old friendwill recommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes	26.221731185913086
2370/28840	You know Bragelonne said Athos I never speak without	34.53573226928711
2371/28840	Well comte I am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the Prince de Marsillac who is happily in Paris just	26.149738311767578
2372/28840	What are you going to do this evening   We intend to visit the Abbé Scarron for whom I have a letter of introduction and at whose house I expect to meet some of my	16.662019729614258
2373/28840	Tis well I will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess do not quit his salon until you have seen	24.85603904724121
2374/28840	There was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of Paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich	58.46688461303711
2375/28840	There was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that	89.36078643798828
2376/28840	Nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went	54.373741149902344
2377/28840	It was the abode of the little Abbé Scar	16.089759826660156
2378/28840	The diminutive Abbé Scarron who however was an abbé only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans which he	49.02619171142578
2379/28840	On a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and	69.37451934814453
2380/28840	He had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to	96.77693176269531
2381/28840	He then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange	49.230224609375
2382/28840	At first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the	87.0699691772461
2383/28840	As soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides Scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy	107.20779418945312
2384/28840	Scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself	108.84083557128906
2385/28840	Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his	61.997718811035156
2386/28840	He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to Paris where the fame of his wit had preceded	47.271785736083984
2387/28840	There he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting Anne of Austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a	56.21546936035156
2388/28840	Yes your majesty there is a title which I covet much replied Scar	81.84140014648438
2389/28840	And what is that   That of being your invalid answered Scar	32.5421142578125
2390/28840	So he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred franc	45.84867477416992
2391/28840	From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life spending both income and	302.6568603515625
2392/28840	One day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so	38.709259033203125
2393/28840	And why asked Scarron is he not a man of good birth  	30.594587326049805
2394/28840	Witty   He has unfortunately too much	130.177490234375
2395/28840	Well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man   Because he is an	16.56488037109375
2396/28840	Of whom   Of the	41.49930953979492
2397/28840	What answered Scarron I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles Despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another	33.6555061340332
2398/28840	Impossible   The conversation had rested there and Scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more	48.422000885009766
2399/28840	It was on Thursday the abbés reception day people went there in	188.38832092285156
2400/28840	The cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehem	46.027923583984375
2401/28840	In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he	28.62997055053711
2402/28840	One of them hat in hand said to him   Would you believe it monsieur that contemptible Mazarin has stopped poor Scarrons	39.18002700805664
2403/28840	That is unreasonable said Athos saluting in his turn the two caval	28.00797462463379
2404/28840	It happens well that we are going there this evening said Athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor	34.424591064453125
2405/28840	Do gentlemen then make verses asked Raoul naively I thought it was	69.43965148925781
2406/28840	So it is my dear vicomte said Athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases famewitness Monsieur de Rot	19.99574851989746
2407/28840	Nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice I think it is better not to make	31.500993728637695
2408/28840	Then said Raoul this Monsieur Scarron is a poet   Yes you are warned vicom	19.98328971862793
2409/28840	Consider well what you do in that	62.10032653808594
2410/28840	Talk only by gestures or rather always	274.4664611816406
2411/28840	You will see me talking with one of my friends the Abbé dHerblay of whom you have often heard me	19.30405616760254
2412/28840	Come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not	45.36684799194336

2414/28840	Very well monsieur I will obey you at all	26.04691505432129
2415/28840	Athos made two visits in Paris at seven oclock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and foot	35.4574089050293
2416/28840	Athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young	35.12248992919922
2417/28840	This was the Abbé Scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand toying nervously with a small	61.82917785644531
2418/28840	Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and	471.2055358886719
2419/28840	Large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent	57.9002685546875

2422/28840	Raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esp	51.00215148925781
2423/28840	After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle Pau	14.37455940246582
2424/28840	Athos touched the shoulder of the vicom	26.044095993041992
2425/28840	Look at this lady Raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her King Henry	68.36243438720703
2426/28840	Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet for she was always very much the	49.131004333496094
2427/28840	She was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens	56.577781677246094
2428/28840	This fawncolored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of La Lion	69.70352172851562
2429/28840	Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queenlike grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on Ra	34.98828887939453

2431/28840	When shall we two walk together Athos then said to Aram	63.00028991699219
2432/28840	Presentlythere are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be	77.55533599853516

2434/28840	At this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated	113.01057434082031
2435/28840	He knew the Abbé de Gondy only by	28.787349700927734

2437/28840	Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his	49.150882720947266
2438/28840	Well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé   This was the orthodox	25.522029876708984
2439/28840	It had been said that evening a hundred timesand Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved	44.73745346069336
2440/28840	Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he	15.63957691192627
2441/28840	But how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre	29.37009620666504
2442/28840	Oh no cried Scarron I should compromise you too	95.71263885498047
2443/28840	Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant   I shall borrow from the	35.15442657470703
2444/28840	But her majesty has no property interposed Aram	66.01848602294922
2445/28840	At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was	10.479181289672852
2446/28840	Scarron turned his chair toward the door Raoul blushed Athos made a sign to Aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a	24.20118522644043
2447/28840	Is he then so ill dear Voiture asked Aramis half hidden by the window	149.0725555419922

2452/28840	You are not called Lionne for nothing observed Madame de Chevreuse your teeth are	50.78035354614258
2453/28840	You are unjust to a great poet it seems to me Raoul ventured to	40.239715576171875

2455/28840	A great poet he is scarcely five feet	226.42295837402344
2456/28840	Bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair Paulet it is high time to put little Voiture in his right	84.1412582397461
2457/28840	For my part I always thought his poetry detestable and I think I know something about	77.59355163574219
2458/28840	Raoul turned and saw two faces just	344.5152282714844
2459/28840	One was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden pet	110.67967987060547
2460/28840	The other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devote	133.12123107910156
2461/28840	Meantime Aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his	64.7979965209961
2462/28840	Aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could not refrain from a slight movement of	17.62495231628418
2463/28840	Laugh then said Monsieur de Retz they are looking at	26.564990997314453
2464/28840	And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse who was in the midst of a large	18.76311683654785
2465/28840	As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gestic	93.35143280029297
2466/28840	Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to	115.25330352783203

2469/28840	Raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round Madame de Chevre	48.158016204833984
2470/28840	Well then asked Athos in a low	9.780818939208984

2540/28840	In recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that Raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young	45.3366813659668

2552/28840	The servant then approached Athos and said hesitatingly   Monsieur le vicomte has no	19.553770065307617

2558/28840	Athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their	79.9039306640625
2559/28840	Raoul delighted at the counts companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this by	259.9901123046875
2560/28840	They set out passing over the Pont Neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called LAbreuvoir Pepin and went along by the walls of the Grand Chate	30.987873077392578
2561/28840	They proceeded to the Rue Saint	28.02338981628418
2562/28840	After passing through the Porte Saint Denis Athos looked at Raouls way of riding and observed   Take care Raoul I have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a	28.992773056030273

2569/28840	I have remarked also another thing said Athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far out	69.53852844238281
2570/28840	This tension lessens the accuracy of the	870.8031005859375
2571/28840	So in twelve times you thrice missed the	165.02072143554688
2572/28840	Which you sir struck twelve times answered Raoul	136.89898681640625
2573/28840	Because I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what I mean   Yes	33.28563690185547
2574/28840	I have fired since in that manner and have been quite	114.08271026611328
2575/28840	What a cold wind resumed Athos a wintry	59.823795318603516

2634/28840	It would be a still worse affair for Mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had	40.327674865722656
2635/28840	It may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the ministertoward the subordinate and the	60.07939147949219
2636/28840	The only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableausuch is the instability of the human mindwas the sullen face of Grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his	63.2546501159668
2637/28840	It is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish	36.21577072143555
2638/28840	And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his	35.66283416748047
2639/28840	He had but one faulthe was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine	88.73270416259766
2640/28840	Now the successor of Pere Marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and Chambertin wine instead of Mac	22.524320602416992
2641/28840	He therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke	44.90835189819336
2642/28840	Since daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of Pere Marte	34.59029769897461
2643/28840	The latter had surpassed himself he showed La Ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with Monsieur de Beauforts coatof	35.39202880859375
2644/28840	It was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near	70.20018005371094
2645/28840	La Ramees mouth watered and he returned to the dukes chamber rubbing his	46.34969711303711
2646/28840	To crown his happiness Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputygovernor of the chate	27.843807220458984
2647/28840	As for Grimaud he seemed more sullen than	28.412704467773438
2648/28840	In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis with La Ramee a sign from Grimaud put him on the	19.813058853149414
2649/28840	Grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the	168.9283447265625
2650/28840	The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so	53.58854675292969
2651/28840	There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different	168.31260681152344
2652/28840	When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle	90.26117706298828
2653/28840	It was evident that there the rope ladder was to be	72.09908294677734
2654/28840	This manoeuvre transparent to the Duc de Beaufort was quite unintelligible to La Rame	14.80679988861084
2655/28840	The game at tennis which upon a sign from Grimaud Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play began in the	43.61924362182617
2656/28840	The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee	58.33123779296875
2657/28840	Four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis	42.90510177612305
2658/28840	When the game was over the duke laughing at La Ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other	86.62870788574219
2659/28840	The guards asked permission of La Ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left	37.18408966064453
2660/28840	Six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served	47.22194290161133
2661/28840	Upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the	60.525543212890625
2662/28840	The rest of the dinner was to	202.4653778076172
2663/28840	Every one was impatient La Ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to	30.744537353515625
2664/28840	One might have fancied that Athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great	37.77289581298828
2665/28840	There were moments when looking at Grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for	69.47114562988281
2666/28840	The prince looked at Grimaud Grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarterpast	34.666351318359375
2667/28840	The escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to	27.139801025390625
2668/28840	La Ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his	49.04155731201172
2669/28840	It was Caesars Commentaries which La Ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey these inj	37.92580795288086
2670/28840	Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was	150.8222198486328
2671/28840	At halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely   Certainly Caesar was the greatest man of ancient	44.762760162353516
2672/28840	You think so my lord answered La Rame	16.67662811279297
2673/28840	Well as for me I prefer	56.66266632080078
2674/28840	And why pray Master La Ramee asked the d	18.81905746459961
2675/28840	Because he left no Commentaries replied La Ramee with his coarse	27.136281967163086
2676/28840	The duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that La Ramee should seat himself	21.562789916992188
2677/28840	There is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so La Ramee when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud presented a type of perfect	65.69596862792969
2678/28840	you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one	109.43942260742188
2679/28840	The duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of Grimaud who kept behind La Rame	20.643352508544922
2680/28840	My dear La Ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless	27.076457977294922
2681/28840	No my lord duke replied La Ramee in the fullness of his heart I say what I think there is no compliment in what I say to you   Then you are attached to me asked the d	15.73163890838623
2682/28840	To own the truth I should be inconsolable if you were to leave Vinc	69.17674255371094
2683/28840	A droll way of showing your aff	353.48809814453125
2684/28840	But my lord returned La Ramee what would you do if you got out Every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the Bastile instead of Vinc	46.73957061767578
2685/28840	Now Monsieur de Chavigny is not amiable I allow but Monsieur du Tremblay is considerably	16.703998565673828
2686/28840	Indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slown	48.99434280395508
2687/28840	Still by one of your forty methods your highness   Yes yes	22.6531925201416
2688/28840	My lord said La Ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your high	28.746129989624023
2689/28840	In ten minutes it would strike	198.7913818359375
2690/28840	Thank you La Ramee said the	37.4500846862793
2691/28840	Well my lord this famous invention of yours   Must I tell you replied the duke on what I most reckon and what I determine to try first   Yes thats the thing my lord cried his custodian g	56.21976089477539
2692/28840	Well I should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like	141.42578125
2693/28840	Well   Having then a keeper like La Ramee I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my	35.02239990234375
2694/28840	Come come said La Ramee thats not a bad	28.335845947265625
2695/28840	Capital isnt it for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to Mazarin as every gentleman ought to	72.24555206298828
2696/28840	Hush dont let us talk politics my	127.27580261230469
2697/28840	Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and I should have news from those without the prison	112.90424346923828
2698/28840	Ah yes but how can the news be brought to you   Nothing easier in a game of tennis for	43.898319244384766
2699/28840	In a game of tennis asked La Ramee giving more serious attention to the dukes	20.587575912475586
2700/28840	Yes see I send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a	65.4453125
2701/28840	Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a	66.70807647705078
2702/28840	Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do	79.48848724365234
2703/28840	The devil it does The devil it does said La Ramee scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that my	31.792591094970703
2704/28840	I shall have to watch the men who pick up	121.91094970703125
2705/28840	But resumed La Ramee that is only a way of	36.138946533203125
2706/28840	And that is a great deal it seems to	13.00350284576416
2707/28840	Pardon me for instance I say to my friends Be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two	41.63312530517578
2708/28840	Well what then La Ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch	43.007591247558594
2709/28840	I have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramp	31.34527587890625
2710/28840	Yes but answered La Ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes cant be sent around a ball like a	54.60978698730469
2711/28840	No but it may be sent in something	98.54193878173828
2712/28840	In something elsein something else In what   In a pate for	135.70809936523438
2713/28840	Let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre dhotel Noirmont has purchased the shop of Pere Marteau   Well said La Ramee shudder	25.00908660888672
2714/28840	Well La Ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall try	37.03358459472656
2715/28840	I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with	54.42577362060547
2716/28840	That we may be more at our ease La Ramee removes the guards keeping only Grimaud to wait on	37.05830001831055
2717/28840	Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in	199.87005615234375
2718/28840	The moment for my escape is fixedseven o	122.6042709350586
2719/28840	Well at a few minutes to seven   At a few minutes to seven cried La Ramee cold sweat upon his	19.483806610107422
2720/28840	At a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words I raise the crust of the pie I find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a	52.23344802856445
2721/28840	He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to La Ramees heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his	23.724349975585938
2722/28840	Meanwhile Grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the	54.564064025878906
2723/28840	La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment	129.24609375
2724/28840	Oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you havent the heart to kill me   No not if thou dost not oppose my	25.143936157226562
2725/28840	But my lord if I allow you to escape I am a ruined	28.37380027770996
2726/28840	I will compensate thee for the loss of thy	59.197776794433594
2727/28840	You are determined to leave the chateau   By Heaven and earth This night I am determined to be	37.6529426574707
2728/28840	And if I defend myself or call or cry out   I will kill thee on the honor of a	37.70323944091797
2729/28840	Seven oclock said Grimaud who had not spoken a	35.20283889770508
2730/28840	La Ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his	79.36302185058594
2731/28840	The duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his	55.28065490722656
2732/28840	Why bind thee   That I may not be considered as your accompl	54.629032135009766
2733/28840	With your belt my lord replied La Rame	25.308856964111328
2734/28840	The duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud who tied La Ramee in such a way as to satisfy	19.65308380126953
2735/28840	La Ramee stretched out his legs Grimaud took a tablecloth tore it into strips and tied La Ramees feet	45.883056640625
2736/28840	Now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangois	43.70757293701172
2737/28840	I ask for it without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I did not raise the	50.470733642578125
2738/28840	Thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it	361.41900634765625
2739/28840	Grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to	57.62302017211914
2740/28840	Now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that I have a wife and four	36.313758850097656
2741/28840	Rest assured put the gag in Grim	205.75750732421875
2742/28840	In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid pro	28.302202224731445
2743/28840	Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a	62.01664352416992
2744/28840	At last they reached the tennis	182.54043579101562
2745/28840	No sentinels no one at any of the	37.85679626464844
2746/28840	The duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding	29.16377830505371
2747/28840	The duke exchanged a signal with	93.53777313232422
2748/28840	It was indeed for him that they were	54.9749641418457
2749/28840	Grimaud meantime undid the means of	380.814453125
2750/28840	This was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the	77.94049072265625
2751/28840	If I am caught I risk nothing but being taken back again to	90.47987365722656
2752/28840	If they catch thee thou wilt be	120.69490051269531
2753/28840	And instantly Grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous	54.82438659667969
2754/28840	The duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary	30.134023666381836
2755/28840	He had gone down about threequarters of the length of the wall when the cord	51.47041320800781
2756/28840	The duke uttered a cry but Grimaud did not give a single	24.464380264282227
2757/28840	He must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he	41.003047943115234
2758/28840	Immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under Grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew Grimaud to	65.20588684082031
2759/28840	Descend my lord said the man in the mo	95.53558349609375
2760/28840	There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is	98.78375244140625
2761/28840	The duke had already begun to	40.3304443359375
2762/28840	His task was the more difficult as there was no board to support	83.99569702148438
2763/28840	He was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty	78.89555358886719
2764/28840	But as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of	38.273563385009766
2765/28840	In less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the	21.23058319091797
2766/28840	He was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told	50.20930480957031
2767/28840	He let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any	166.44573974609375
2768/28840	He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met De Roche	32.27102279663086
2769/28840	The other two gentlemen were unknown to	70.5506591796875
2770/28840	Grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a	168.26968383789062
2771/28840	Gentlemen said the duke I will thank you later now we have not a moment to	66.31803131103516
2772/28840	The timely Arrival of DArtagnan in	61.51736068725586
2773/28840	At Blois DArtagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any future service he might render the	36.79191207885742
2774/28840	From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but DArtagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint	32.79286575317383
2775/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos recognized	16.817581176757812
2776/28840	Thank God you have come   Eh goodday dear friend replied DArtagn	28.683116912841797
2777/28840	Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the	22.60732650756836
2778/28840	Ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses	69.49788665771484
2779/28840	Indeed said DArtagnan I am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine	21.618759155273438
2780/28840	The pretty Madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthoss words for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be	51.42150115966797
2781/28840	When will you do that   Immediately I	46.67119598388672
2782/28840	Ah so much the better   To that exclamation of Porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a	37.21330261230469
2783/28840	DArtagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of Mousqueton whose downdrawn mouth emitted sounds of	26.768465042114258
2784/28840	And you too my poor Monsieur Mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked DArtagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or	33.062625885009766
2785/28840	He finds the cooking detestable replied Porth	53.895179748535156
2786/28840	As for the cellar I have searched every part and poor stuff I	146.09335327148438
2787/28840	Monsieur Mouston said DArtagnan I should indeed condole with you had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend	31.75525665283203
2788/28840	Then taking Porthos aside   My dear Du Vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for I am going to take you to the card	31.523014068603516
2789/28840	Gracious me really exclaimed Porthos opening his great wondering	63.88173294067383
2790/28840	A presentation indeed   Does that alarm you   No but it agitates	59.559852600097656
2791/28840	Oh dont be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another	141.7144317626953

2793/28840	Tis the same thingyou understand me DArtagnana	35.331817626953125

2795/28840	The queen Rest assured we shall not see	39.55644607543945
2796/28840	And you say that we are going from here to the Palais Royal  	16.919897079467773
2797/28840	Only that there may be no delay I shall borrow one of your	32.3147087097168
2798/28840	Certainly all the four are at your	72.4630126953125
2799/28840	Oh I need only one of them for the time	78.0116195678711

2801/28840	As to Planchet he has certain reasons for not going to	45.73153305053711
2802/28840	And what are they   Oh he doesnt stand well with his em	38.83474349975586
2803/28840	Mouston said Porthos saddle Vulcan and Bay	92.56178283691406
2804/28840	And for myself monsieur shall I saddle Rustaud   No take a more stylish horse Phoebus or Superbe we are going with some	53.30839157104492
2805/28840	Ah said Mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit   Oh yes of course Mouston nothing	37.64390182495117
2806/28840	But to avoid risk put the pistols in the hol	116.79016876220703
2807/28840	You will find mine on my saddle already	181.15330505371094
2808/28840	Mouston breathed a sigh he couldnt understand visits of ceremony made under	198.1597442626953
2809/28840	Indeed said Porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right DArtagnan Mouston will do Mouston has a very fine	18.903390884399414
2810/28840	But you my friendare you not going to change your dress   No I shall go as I	31.371644973754883
2811/28840	This traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his	173.80287170410156
2812/28840	They set out on Vulcan and Bayard followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to	18.919063568115234
2813/28840	Mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of Don Quixote was then the fashion they said that he was Sancho who after having lost one master had found	113.8070297241211
2814/28840	On reaching the palace DArtagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without	27.253416061401367
2815/28840	He was soon ordered to the presence of the	43.271244049072266
2816/28840	Courage he whispered to Porthos as they	26.468294143676758
2817/28840	Believe me the eye of the eagle is closed	239.83355712890625
2818/28840	We have only the vulture to deal	65.56856536865234
2819/28840	Hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of	49.193416595458984
2820/28840	Gervais and do not bow too low to this Italian that might give him a poor idea of	111.21305084228516
2821/28840	Good   Mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the	39.88825988769531
2822/28840	He saw DArtagnan and Porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his count	41.21485137939453
2823/28840	Ah you is it Monsieur le lieutenant you have been very	68.89936828613281
2824/28840	Here I am at your eminences service as well as Monsieur du Vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of Porth	22.00556755065918
2825/28840	Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of	24.828283309936523
2826/28840	The best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said DArtagn	25.24725914001465
2827/28840	Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times Frederick of Prussia used to	199.6309051513672
2828/28840	He admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of Porth	122.11941528320312
2829/28840	He seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and	111.70499420166016
2830/28840	He remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four	45.67270278930664
2831/28840	And your two other friends he	258.8927917480469
2832/28840	Porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn DArtagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his	23.990623474121094
2833/28840	They are prevented at this moment but will join us	99.55562591552734
2834/28840	And this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he	85.8713150024414
2835/28840	Yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for Monsieur de Bracieux is	18.095149993896484
2836/28840	Rich said Mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great	124.9113540649414
2837/28840	Fifty thousand francs a year said Porth	65.62252044677734
2838/28840	These were the first words he had	40.93744659423828
2839/28840	From pure zeal resumed Mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then   My lord has perhaps no faith in those words said DArtagn	44.115936279296875
2840/28840	Have you Monsieur le Gascon asked Mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his	23.802989959716797
2841/28840	I replied the Gascon I believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to	89.71024322509766
2842/28840	Now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a bar	35.97751235961914
2843/28840	Only that said Mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthoss devotion without opening his purse only that That can be	61.75150680541992
2844/28840	I shall be baron explained Porthos stepping	63.287109375
2845/28840	I told you so said DArtagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms	14.984258651733398
2846/28840	And you Monsieur DArtagnan what do you want   My lord said DArtagnan it is twenty years since Cardinal de Richelieu made me	11.153705596923828
2847/28840	Yes and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you	48.48048782348633
2848/28840	We will see gentlemen we will	77.52949523925781
2849/28840	Now Monsieur de Vallon said Mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country   Porthos opened his mouth to	18.306852340698242
2850/28840	My lord said DArtagnan Monsieur de Vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and	56.643192291259766
2851/28840	That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin he fell into	99.67799377441406
2852/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the	24.737695693969727
2853/28840	Well sir exclaimed Mazarin whats the matter and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded marketplace   My lord replied the messenger I wish to speak to your eminence in	28.414505004882812
2854/28840	I am Monsieur du Poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of Vinc	28.230091094970703
2855/28840	Mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that DArtagnan and Porthos should give	28.725391387939453
2856/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the	9.101780891418457
2857/28840	Speak monsieur speak at once said Mazarin What is the matter   The matter is my lord that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to escape from the Chateau of Vinc	13.850746154785156
2858/28840	Mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the	73.73805236816406
2859/28840	He fell back almost fainting in his	34.75547409057617
2860/28840	Escaped Monsieur de Beaufort escaped   My lord I saw him run off from the top of the terr	25.98017692565918
2861/28840	And you did not fire on him   He was out of	49.847721099853516
2862/28840	Monsieur de Chavignywhere was he  	13.48796558380127
2863/28840	And La Ramee   Was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near	32.920509338378906
2864/28840	But the man who was under him   Was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with	48.787776947021484
2865/28840	My lord said DArtagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious	15.032831192016602
2866/28840	It may still be possible to overtake the	92.45296478271484
2867/28840	France is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues	100.186767578125
2868/28840	And who is to pursue him cried Maz	62.7286491394043
2869/28840	So would you said Mazarin looking with astonishment at those two	37.722801208496094
2870/28840	But the duke will not yield himself without a furious	72.40194702148438
2871/28840	Very well said DArtagnan his eyes aflame battle It is a long time since we have had a battle eh Porthos   Battle cried Porth	20.16729736328125
2872/28840	And you think you can catch him   Yes if we are better mounted than	27.54619789123535
2873/28840	Go then take what guards you find here and pursue	152.9921112060547
2874/28840	As for you my dear lieutenant I promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you	27.421737670898438
2875/28840	To horse Porthos said DArtagnan taking his friend by the	17.200275421142578
2876/28840	Here I am smiled Porthos with his sublime	89.65524291992188
2877/28840	They descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out To arms To arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the speed of the	53.41392517089844
2878/28840	Well baron I promise you some good exercise said the Gas	57.90324783325195
2879/28840	As they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers	136.7939910888672
2880/28840	At the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean DArtagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get	49.59926223754883
2881/28840	The troop continued its course as though their steeds had	156.67311096191406
2882/28840	Alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the	59.74517059326172
2883/28840	The musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and of the road to Vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a	19.62774658203125
2884/28840	The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furn	94.3951416015625
2885/28840	DArtagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most Mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective	27.991165161132812
2886/28840	From the top of an eminence DArtagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint	23.713268280029297
2887/28840	He rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the	85.11141204833984
2888/28840	In five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by	46.32255554199219
2889/28840	The several members of that group were much	173.79434204101562
2890/28840	They looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the	59.67501449584961
2891/28840	Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conject	135.4434356689453
2892/28840	On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened	30.583223342895508
2893/28840	A few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his	34.733924865722656
2894/28840	My officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop	52.70595169067383
2895/28840	That prohibition is not for me said DArtagn	44.919525146484375
2896/28840	Have the fugitives been pursued   Yes my officer unfortunately they are well	92.03782653808594
2897/28840	How many are there   Four and a fifth whom they carried away	169.4739990234375
2898/28840	Do you hear baron They are only four   A joyous smile lighted Porthoss	51.46569061279297
2899/28840	How long a start have they   Two hours and a quarter my	111.56977844238281
2900/28840	Two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not Porthos   Porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor	37.49769592285156
2901/28840	Very good said DArtagnan and now in what direction did they set out   That I am forbidden to	23.92860984802246
2902/28840	DArtagnan drew from his pocket a	9.732355117797852
2903/28840	And where is the governor   In the	28.757884979248047
2904/28840	Anger mounted to DArtagnans face he frowned and his cheeks were	72.9664306640625
2905/28840	Ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant I believe you are impudent to me Wait   He unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked	22.470849990844727
2906/28840	Order of the king I tell	52.586795806884766
2907/28840	Read and answer or I will blow out your brains   The sergeant saw that DArtagnan was in	26.57937240600586
2908/28840	And by what gate did they go out   By the Saint Maur	34.75981521606445
2909/28840	If you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged	47.14102554321289
2910/28840	And if you catch up with them you wont come back to hang me murmured the	58.438228607177734
2911/28840	DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and	15.391904830932617
2912/28840	This way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed	59.48648452758789
2913/28840	But now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double	30.615259170532227
2914/28840	It was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten	54.169593811035156
2915/28840	This last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell	95.69903564453125
2916/28840	DArtagnan who never turned his head did not perceive	25.48040008544922
2917/28840	Porthos told him of it in his calm	46.060340881347656
2918/28840	If only we two arrive said DArtagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are only four in	54.763275146484375
2919/28840	That is true said Porthos   And he spurred his courser	36.91902542114258
2920/28840	At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their	55.4439582824707
2921/28840	Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said Porth	95.5982437133789
2922/28840	Let us rather kill them yes kill them cried DArtagnan I see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this	38.89326095581055
2923/28840	In fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of	154.9656982421875
2924/28840	They set out after a run of two leagues Mousquetons horse	129.9862060546875
2925/28840	Gracious me said Porthos theres Phoebus	34.33928298950195
2926/28840	The cardinal will pay you a hundred pist	19.098735809326172
2927/28840	Let us set out again at full gall	48.13534927368164
2928/28840	But at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him	41.71010208129883
2929/28840	The devil exclaimed Porthos theres Vulcan found	46.07404708862305
2930/28840	Zounds cried DArtagnan then we must stop Give me your horse Porth	34.653682708740234
2931/28840	What the devil are you doing   By Jove I am falling or rather Bayard is falling answered Porth	21.924222946166992
2932/28840	What is it   I hear a	34.36962127685547
2933/28840	It belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking	46.732093811035156
2934/28840	No said DArtagnan it is in	12.345234870910645
2935/28840	That is another thing said Porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by DArtagn	26.137367248535156
2936/28840	Monsieur said Mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master Phoebus could no longer hold out and   Silence said Porth	21.345523834228516
2937/28840	In fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night	57.174598693847656
2938/28840	It is five hundred feet from here in advance said DArtagn	21.22187614440918
2939/28840	True monsieur said Mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting	19.141019821166992
2940/28840	Good said DArtagnan seizing his own now you understand Porthos   Not too	21.74765396118164
2941/28840	We are out on the kings	128.34481811523438
2942/28840	Well   For the kings service we need	60.68000411987305
2943/28840	Then not a word but set to work   They went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some	44.21091079711914
2944/28840	Yonder is the house Porthos said the Gascon let me do what I please and do you what I	42.33787155151367
2945/28840	They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine	70.02863311767578
2946/28840	A groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and brid	85.4666976928711
2947/28840	DArtagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps	28.237092971801758
2948/28840	I buy those horses he said to the	81.85779571533203
2949/28840	The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no	21.275814056396484
2950/28840	Didnt you hear fellow   Yes I	207.32174682617188

2955/28840	Half an hours rest is enough replied the Gas	91.90757751464844
2956/28840	A kind of steward appeared just as DArtagnan and his companions were prepared to	48.88926696777344
2957/28840	My dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word I will blow out your	33.13973617553711
2958/28840	But sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon   So much the better they must be good animals	14.30627155303955
2959/28840	And I mine Ive ten guards behind me dont you hear them gallop and Im one of the kings musket	62.39516067504883
2960/28840	They all mounted the horses as quickly as	122.3774185180664
2961/28840	Halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines   On on cried DArtagnan therell be firing on   They all set off swift as the	42.80824661254883

2963/28840	Take care of your horses cried DArtagnan to	28.11701202392578
2964/28840	A gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the	30.577054977416992
2965/28840	Ah I understand replied Porthos she has ordered relays of	68.74401092529297
2966/28840	And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left   My dear Porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said DArtagnan with a look as if he spoke against his	22.214487075805664
2967/28840	Pooh replied Porthos I am what I	27.13251495361328
2968/28840	They rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and	46.09983825683594
2969/28840	You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said Porth	31.42125129699707

2971/28840	Ah ah have we overtaken them   Good a dead horse said DArtagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as	57.51853942871094
2972/28840	I seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed Porthos leaning over his horses man	33.53300094604492
2973/28840	Saddled   Yes saddled and brid	48.79289245605469
2974/28840	Courage we have them   But if they are numerous observed Mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have	25.17220687866211
2975/28840	Nonsense cried DArtagnan theyll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as were in pursuit theyll be afraid and will	73.52935791015625
2976/28840	Ah do you see cried the	50.0149040222168
2977/28840	The lights again this time I too saw them said Porth	102.6268081665039
2978/28840	On on forward forward cried DArtagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five	47.15956497192383
2979/28840	The horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the	29.32703971862793
2980/28840	They rode on in this way for ten	74.63134765625
2981/28840	Suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horse	95.4352798461914
2982/28840	Aha cried DArtagnan theyre coming toward	33.83368682861328
2983/28840	So much the worse for them said Porth	14.967381477355957
2984/28840	Who goes there cried a hoarse	32.782501220703125
2985/28840	The three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were	28.819055557250977
2986/28840	Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their	43.59996795654297
2987/28840	Who goes there was asked a second	84.39637756347656
2988/28840	Not a step forward or youre dead	115.69903564453125
2989/28840	Stuff cried Porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his	60.29955291748047
2990/28840	Stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our	141.29730224609375
2991/28840	Hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their	76.67427825927734
2992/28840	As for Porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from	42.64217758178711
2993/28840	Finish Mouston finish the work cried Porth	132.95196533203125
2994/28840	And he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh	77.55929565429688
2995/28840	Ive broken my mans skull cried DArtagn	71.01115417480469
2996/28840	And you   Ive only thrown the fellow down but hark   Another shot of a carbine was	63.58090591430664
2997/28840	It was Mousqueton who was obeying his masters	27.372426986694336
2998/28840	On on cried DArtagnan all goes well we have the first	40.5587158203125
2999/28840	Ha ha answered Porthos behold other players	360.1664123535156
3000/28840	And in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the	66.11052703857422
3001/28840	This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to	104.12079620361328
3002/28840	Stand aside he cried stand off the road   What do you want asked a	29.293527603149414
3003/28840	The duke Porthos and DArtagnan roared out both at	15.541210174560547
3004/28840	A burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a gro	100.0298080444336
3005/28840	DArtagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had	47.55055618286133
3006/28840	At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and DArtagnan turned to	15.99590015411377
3007/28840	What would you have my dear fellow One doesnt hit the bullseye every time it is something to hit inside the	128.68946838378906
3008/28840	Ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse   Your horse is falling said Porthos reining in his	34.82341003417969
3009/28840	In truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to	35.716373443603516
3010/28840	He had received in the chest the bullet of DArtagnans first	84.46006774902344
3011/28840	DArtagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the	18.243873596191406
3012/28840	Does your honor want a horse asked Mousqu	68.90495300292969
3013/28840	Heres one your honor   How the devil hast thou two horses asked DArtagnan jumping on one of	27.481828689575195
3014/28840	Their masters are dead I thought they might be useful so I took	116.5361557006836
3015/28840	Be on the qui vive cried DArtagn	27.819992065429688
3016/28840	As he spoke two horsemen advanced at full	103.90653228759766
3017/28840	Ho your honor cried Mousqueton the man you upset is getting	63.85538864135742
3018/28840	Why didnt thou do as thou didst to the first man said Porth	67.93366241455078
3019/28840	I held the horses my hands were full your	408.7962951660156
3020/28840	A shot was fired that moment Mousqueton shrieked with	70.81668090820312
3021/28840	Ah sir Im hit in the other side exactly opposite the other This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the road to Am	92.74080657958984
3022/28840	Mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the	56.65105056762695
3023/28840	On perceiving the cavaliers DArtagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh besides his horse he found had a carbine on the bow of the	43.877479553222656
3024/28840	Shall we wait or shall we charge   Let us charge them answered the Gas	30.018239974975586
3025/28840	They spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from	44.851280212402344
3026/28840	The king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of	52.34854507446289
3027/28840	Tis well we will see if the kings name is not a passport everywhere replied the Gas	30.493568420410156
3028/28840	Two shots were fired at once one by DArtagnan the other by the adversary of Porth	15.904111862182617
3029/28840	DArtagnans ball took off his enemys	28.910619735717773
3030/28840	The ball fired by Porthoss foe went through the throat of his horse which fell gro	70.31686401367188
3031/28840	For the last time where are you going   To the devil answered DArtagn	21.091081619262695
3032/28840	Good you may be easy thenyoull get	116.20427703857422
3033/28840	DArtagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his hol	24.077465057373047
3034/28840	He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once given him and made his horse	49.928993225097656
3035/28840	The ball struck the animal full in	338.64556884765625
3036/28840	DArtagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one	51.5512580871582
3037/28840	Ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between	66.84578704833984
3038/28840	To the sword sir the sword   And he jumped off his	57.413700103759766
3039/28840	To the swords be it so replied DArtagnan that is exactly what I	28.43906593322754
3040/28840	DArtagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him	74.37590789794922
3041/28840	Twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one	458.00787353515625
3042/28840	Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting	232.98031616210938
3043/28840	At last DArtagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in	42.46531677246094
3044/28840	He brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove	73.79894256591797
3045/28840	Sdeath he cried with his Gascon	57.69989776611328
3046/28840	At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the	75.67930603027344
3047/28840	As to DArtagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the	38.99399948120117
3048/28840	Have a care cried Porthos to his opponent Ive still two pistols	128.25929260253906
3049/28840	The more reason you should fire the first cried his	237.62245178222656
3050/28840	Porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of	50.487030029296875
3051/28840	As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two	66.1627197265625
3052/28840	Athos raised his sword DArtagnan lowered	25.861391067504883
3053/28840	Aramis cried Athos dont fire   Ah ha is it you Aramis said Porth	12.531624794006348
3054/28840	Aramis pushed his back into his saddlebags and sheathed his	27.689598083496094
3055/28840	My son exclaimed Athos extending his hand to DArtagn	7.917604923248291
3056/28840	This was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender	66.69442749023438
3057/28840	So you defend him And I who have sworn to take him dead or alive I am dishonoredand by you   Kill me replied Athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my	43.721153259277344
3058/28840	Oh woe is me woe is me cried the lieutenant theres only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my	104.9696044921875
3059/28840	Fifty cavaliers cried the Gascon and Porth	61.82195281982422
3060/28840	Look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the d	79.78057861328125
3061/28840	The two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horse	27.87504005432129
3062/28840	Hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke I fancied you had about twenty men with you so I came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only	52.97604751586914
3063/28840	Yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said Ath	48.04120635986328

3066/28840	Some of the men moved toward	63.91000747680664
3067/28840	One moment my lord whispered Athos and he said something in a low	37.557796478271484
3068/28840	I am too much indebted to you to refuse your first	22.987810134887695
3069/28840	Gentlemen he said to his escort	487.15875244140625
3070/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan Monsieur du Vallon you are	5.529790878295898
3071/28840	The order was obeyed DArtagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large	22.818885803222656
3072/28840	Now DHerblay said Athos dismount and come	41.99165344238281
3073/28840	Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos whilst Athos approached DArtagn	9.062844276428223
3074/28840	Friends said Athos do you regret you have not shed our blood   No replied DArtagnan I regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each	23.105587005615234
3075/28840	Ah nothing will ever go well with us hereafter   Oh Heaven No all is over said Porth	62.67483139038086
3076/28840	Well be on our side now resumed Aram	47.933441162109375
3077/28840	Silence DHerblay cried Athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as	53.36845397949219
3078/28840	Tis a matter of conscience with them as with	76.21833038330078
3079/28840	Meantime here we are enemies said Porth	89.47531127929688
3080/28840	Gramercy who would ever have thought it   DArtagnan only	118.9516372680664
3081/28840	Athos looked at them both and took their hands in	34.05519104003906
3082/28840	Gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and	105.7042465209961
3083/28840	Yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth But we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is	93.10488891601562
3084/28840	For my own part I demand it said Aram	71.29095458984375
3085/28840	Let us choose a place of rendezvous continued Athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each	114.9891586303711
3086/28840	Well then the place   Will the Place Royale suit you asked DArtagn	33.704986572265625
3087/28840	Athos and Aramis looked at each	8.087067604064941

3094/28840	DArtagnan recognized the voice of De Roche	16.08498764038086

3098/28840	Adieu we shall meet soon I trust in Paris where you shall have your	83.83032989501953
3099/28840	The duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and	41.01540756225586
3100/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to	15.101829528808594
3101/28840	What do I see cried the	89.92558288574219
3102/28840	Grimaud is it thou   Grimaud signified that he was not	60.42277526855469
3103/28840	And whose horses are these cried DArtagn	28.626529693603516

3107/28840	It is IMousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the	42.50126647949219
3108/28840	Art thou dangerously wounded my dear Mousqueton he	45.347049713134766
3109/28840	What can we do said DArtagnan we must return to	14.090994834899902
3110/28840	I will take care of Mousqueton said Grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could Grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him	29.712759017944336
3111/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos went on meantime to	12.148992538452148
3112/28840	They were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of DArtagnan and Porth	14.872273445129395
3113/28840	Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against	59.23798370361328
3114/28840	What consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase DArtagnan has done me one good turnhe has destroyed Brous	52.756614685058594
3115/28840	This Gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of	93.78081512451172
3116/28840	The cardinal referred to that man whom DArtagnan upset at the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris and who was no other than the Councillor Brous	17.275894165039062
3117/28840	The four old Friends prepare to meet	353.8393859863281
3118/28840	What are you eating there Porthos   I am dipping a biscuit in a glass of Spanish wine do the	28.824600219726562
3119/28840	Well how has all gone off   Zounds you know theres only one way of saying things so I went in and said My lord we were not the strongest	58.23530197143555
3120/28840	Yes I know that he said but give me the	33.582149505615234
3121/28840	You know Porthos I could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so I merely said they were fifty and we were	61.47835922241211
3122/28840	There was firing nevertheless I heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day I presume   That is the night my lord I	70.6259536743164
3123/28840	Ah cried the cardinal I thought you were a Gascon my friend   I am a Gascon said I only when I	25.67562484741211
3124/28840	The answer pleased him and he	265.17816162109375
3125/28840	Well theres nothing bad in that it seems to me said Porth	31.375041961669922
3126/28840	Oh mon Dieu no nothing at	125.56352996826172
3127/28840	It was the way in which he	33.528926849365234
3128/28840	It is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine They are veritable sponges Gimblou another	122.2952880859375
3129/28840	The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration DArtagnan enjoyed in the	47.684547424316406
3130/28840	He continued   So I was going away but he called me	43.932987213134766
3131/28840	You have had three horses foundered or killed he asked	247.004150390625
3132/28840	How much were they worth   Why said Porthos that was very good of him it seems to	25.615631103515625
3133/28840	Oh oh that is a large	126.37876892089844
3134/28840	If he knew anything about horses he would dispute the	91.2850112915039
3135/28840	Faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible	45.517784118652344
3136/28840	He made a great start and looked at	45.77312469482422
3137/28840	I also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in	48.75774002075195
3138/28840	For a thousand pistoles   For a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too	44.171897888183594
3139/28840	And you have them   They are	24.759859085083008
3140/28840	Upon my word I think he acted very	153.44947814941406
3141/28840	Generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service   A great servicewhat was that   Why it seems that I crushed for him a parliament	41.429012298583984
3142/28840	What that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint Jean Cemetery   Thats the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the	48.73988723754883
3143/28840	It seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an	37.559146881103516
3144/28840	See that now said Porthos and I turned my horse aside from going plump on to him That will be for another	100.23287200927734
3145/28840	He owed me for the councillor the pettifogger   But said Porthos if he was not crushed completely   Ah Monsieur de Richelieu would have said Five hundred crowns for the	30.122480392456055
3146/28840	Well lets say no more about	107.93595886230469
3147/28840	How much were your animals worth Porthos   Ah if poor Mousqueton were here he could tell you to a	35.882022857666016
3148/28840	No matter you can tell within ten crown	230.1507568359375
3149/28840	Why Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the	69.81249237060547
3150/28840	There will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said DArtagnan content	21.68311882019043
3151/28840	Yes said Porthos but there are the equip	26.279666900634766
3152/28840	Well how much for the equipments   If we say one hundred pistoles for the three   Good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and	36.57771301269531
3153/28840	We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said DArtagnan and share the three	29.64113998413086
3154/28840	A paltry piece of business murmured DArtagnan crumpling his	44.469669342041016
3155/28840	Pooh said Porthos it is always	29.22372817993164
3156/28840	Stop I want to remember his exact	134.15257263183594
3157/28840	He said As to your friend tell him he may sleep in	120.4659423828125
3158/28840	Good very good said Porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a bar	41.31285095214844
3159/28840	Ah yes said Porthos there is nine o	19.86988639831543
3160/28840	We have a rendezvous you remember at the Place	56.823848724365234
3161/28840	Ah stop hold your peace Porthos dont remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since	90.54473876953125
3162/28840	Because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our	50.38322067260742
3163/28840	And yet said Porthos neither of them had any advantage over	67.05316162109375
3164/28840	I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in	142.56613159179688
3165/28840	We must go said the superb lord of Bracieux lest they should say we were	43.020381927490234
3166/28840	We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place	67.09224700927734
3167/28840	Yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of	90.47616577148438
3168/28840	Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms	49.002906799316406
3169/28840	We discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going today to learn something else   You really have some distrust then said Porth	50.373924255371094
3170/28840	Of Aramis yes since he has become an abb	24.95704460144043
3171/28840	You cant imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he	98.50153350830078
3172/28840	He sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his	37.05147933959961
3173/28840	Ah as regards Aramis that is another thing said Porthos and it wouldnt surprise me at	24.447628021240234
3174/28840	Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on	17.436113357543945
3175/28840	Nonsense He had us in his power and he let us	107.02228546142578
3176/28840	Besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let Planchet post himself behind us with his carb	54.91646194458008
3177/28840	Devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said Porth	102.16817474365234
3178/28840	Ah if Mousqueton were here theres a fellow who will never desert me   So long as you are rich Ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites	40.88233947753906
3179/28840	It is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfish	64.33403015136719
3180/28840	Yes you are right let us go Porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were	32.18364715576172
3181/28840	Halloo Planchet here saddle our horses take your carb	70.83816528320312
3182/28840	Whom are we going to attack sir   No one a mere matter of precaution answered the Gas	48.538631439208984
3183/28840	You know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor Broussel the father of the people   Really did they said DArtagn	55.092159271240234
3184/28840	He was carried home in the arms of the	34.19166564941406
3185/28840	His house has been full ever	464.77056884765625
3186/28840	He has received visits from the coadjutor from Madame de Longueville and the Prince de Conti Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his	13.779711723327637
3187/28840	And now whenever he wishes   Well whenever he wishes   Planchet began to sing   Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce matin Je crois quil gronde Contre le Maz	25.98143196105957
3188/28840	Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce mat	32.318077087402344
3189/28840	It doesnt surprise me said DArtagnan in a low tone to Porthos that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the life out of his	25.38504409790039
3190/28840	From Friquet I know that name   A son of Monsieur de Broussels servant and a lad that I promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the	36.90815353393555
3191/28840	Is he not a singing boy at Notre Dame asked DArtagn	53.5815315246582
3192/28840	Yes that is the very boy hes patronized by Baz	88.31704711914062
3193/28840	Of what importance is this little reptile to you asked Porth	30.503145217895508
3194/28840	Gad replied DArtagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same	35.394989013671875
3195/28840	Whilst all this was going on Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by the Faubourg	33.7680549621582
3196/28840	They had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed	37.10745620727539
3197/28840	Bazin was their only attendant for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of Mousqu	46.26275634765625
3198/28840	As they were passing onward Athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the	58.33449172973633
3199/28840	Oh no dear count cried Aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to   What do you mean Aramis   That the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois and nothing	21.895692825317383
3200/28840	What our friends   Are become our most dangerous enemies Ath	104.5680923461914
3201/28840	Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble	84.47102355957031
3202/28840	What can you expect Athos Men are so made and we are not always twenty years	61.06008529663086
3203/28840	We have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which DArtagnan is blindly	40.28520584106445
3204/28840	Did you not observe his despair on the journey As to Porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that	74.19221496582031
3205/28840	Well he found us on his road and will not be baron this	42.35285568237305
3206/28840	Perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this	37.07865524291992
3207/28840	But suppose they come unarmed What a disgrace to	253.5774688720703
3208/28840	Oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents	110.54803466796875
3209/28840	Go in whatever guise you choose for my part I shall go	43.78578567504883
3210/28840	No for I will not allow you to do	12.552023887634277
3211/28840	Tis not one man not Athos only not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon	38.015342712402344
3212/28840	Be it so then replied Athos sorrow	80.28604888916016
3213/28840	And they pursued their road in mournful	45.603912353515625
3214/28840	They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the	17.33624267578125
3215/28840	Athos therefore commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same	31.903854370117188
3216/28840	They then advanced two and two and saluted each other	91.80770874023438
3217/28840	The gate is shut said Aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion I will get the key from the Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well	48.4747200012207
3218/28840	DArtagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the	25.288223266601562
3219/28840	Porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the	48.7775993347168
3220/28840	If you prefer any other place said Athos in his persuasive voice choose for	78.21652221679688
3221/28840	This place if Monsieur dHerblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the	43.71510696411133
3222/28840	Aramis went off at once begging Athos not to remain alone within reach of DArtagnan and Porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous	20.12885856628418
3223/28840	Aramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan who was saying to him   You swear sir that it is not so   Stop and Aramis gave him a louis d	33.241859436035156
3224/28840	Ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his	20.186073303222656
3225/28840	Well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are excellent	86.07017517089844
3226/28840	Yes certainly added Athos and the other	72.96375274658203
3227/28840	DArtagnan had heard the conversation and had understood	23.921491622924805
3228/28840	What do I see   That he wouldnt	53.734127044677734
3229/28840	Swear what   That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place Royale to	51.526954650878906
3230/28840	And Aramis wouldnt swear  	57.51234436035156
3231/28840	Attention then   Athos did not lose sight of the two	46.51409149169922
3232/28840	Aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that DArtagnan and Porthos might	14.066156387329102
3233/28840	Do you see whispered Aramis to Athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the Gascon wore under his	18.70231819152832
3234/28840	Alas I do replied Athos with a deep	21.843717575073242
3235/28840	He entered third and Aramis who shut the gate after him	109.34245300292969
3236/28840	The two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective	92.86444091796875
3237/28840	They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the limet	37.47410202026367
3238/28840	There were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from Athos Porthos and DArtagnan sat down the two others stood in front of	27.57915687561035
3239/28840	After a few minutes of silent embarrassment Athos	93.84053802490234
3240/28840	Gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach	88.9497299194336
3241/28840	Hear me count replied DArtagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest	49.104244232177734
3242/28840	I wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or Monsieur dHerblay If so speak out answered Ath	25.215892791748047
3243/28840	You asked for candor and you have	93.61180114746094
3244/28840	You ask what I have against you I tell	52.785213470458984
3245/28840	And I have the same sincerity to show you if you wish Monsieur dHerblay I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived	24.74202537536621
3246/28840	Really monsieur you say strange things said Aram	32.374427795410156
3247/28840	You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them No you sounded me nothing	129.16925048828125
3248/28840	Very well what did I say to you that Mazarin was contemptible and that I wouldnt serve Maz	28.311906814575195
3249/28840	Did I tell you that I wouldnt serve any other On the contrary I gave you to understand I think that I adhered to the	37.694480895996094
3250/28840	We even joked very pleasantly if I remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my	64.58120727539062
3251/28840	Were you a party man There is no doubt of	75.23286437988281
3252/28840	Well why should not we too belong to a party You had your secret and we had ours we didnt exchange	144.78318786621094
3253/28840	So much the better it proves that we know how to keep our	41.90834045410156
3254/28840	I do not reproach you monsieur said DArtagnan tis only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your	15.260010719299316
3255/28840	And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked Aramis haught	49.81058120727539
3256/28840	The blood mounted instantly to the temples of DArtagnan who arose and replied   I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jes	56.444854736328125
3257/28840	On seeing DArtagnan rise Porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each	41.106842041015625
3258/28840	Upon hearing DArtagnans reply Aramis seemed about to draw his sword when Athos prevented	36.41960906982422
3259/28840	DArtagnan he said you are here tonight still infuriated by yesterdays	21.11595916748047
3260/28840	I believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an	51.6901741027832
3261/28840	Come do you really think you have anything to say against me Say it then if I am in fault I will avow the	33.1998405456543
3262/28840	The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of Aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated	53.42194366455078
3263/28840	At that time I was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me However because I was prudent you must not take me for a	33.737083435058594
3264/28840	If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur dHerblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder I could have spoken	35.591033935546875
3265/28840	What are you meddling with cried Aramis pale with anger suspecting that DArtagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longue	23.400678634643555
3266/28840	Porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a	41.879703521728516
3267/28840	He said yes and he put his hand on his	24.724994659423828
3268/28840	DArtagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his	54.8763313293457
3269/28840	Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his	36.91980743408203
3270/28840	Then turning to Aramis   Aramis he said break your	35.994232177734375
3271/28840	It must be done said Athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he	47.96755599975586
3272/28840	Then Aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with	49.867454528808594
3273/28840	These proceedings made DArtagnan and Porthos draw	22.00688934326172
3274/28840	DArtagnan did not draw his sword Porthos put his back into the she	14.71635627746582
3275/28840	DArtagnan I have always loved you as my son Porthos we slept six years side by side Aramis is your brother as well as mine and Aramis has once loved you as I love you now and as I have ever loved	37.58353042602539
3276/28840	I repeat my words Aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old	43.931270599365234
3277/28840	There was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by Aram	99.62400817871094
3278/28840	I swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion I swear that I no longer bear animosity to those who were once my	46.4249153137207
3279/28840	I regret that I ever crossed swords with you Porthos I swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now Athos	52.27117919921875
3280/28840	And he threw himself into the arms of Ath	6.271914482116699
3281/28840	My son exclaimed Athos pressing him in his	46.435367584228516
3282/28840	And as for me said Porthos I swear nothing but Im	23.517507553100586
3283/28840	Forsooth If I were obliged to fight against you I think I should allow myself to be pierced through and through for I never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced Ath	47.65781021118164
3284/28840	My friends said Athos this is what I expected from such hearts as	44.558799743652344
3285/28840	Yes I have said it and I now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent	39.45926284790039
3286/28840	I respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain	164.36997985839844

3288/28840	Yes replied DArtagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battlestandard that famous napkin of the bastion	25.870634078979492

3291/28840	And whenever added Athos we meet in battle at this word Place Royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest	56.139739990234375
3292/28840	And are the first of men added DArtagn	25.26076889038086
3293/28840	Gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good Christians   Egad said DArtagnan by Heaven	79.82441711425781
3294/28840	We should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said Aram	36.71017074584961
3295/28840	Ah Im ready to do what you will cried Porthos even to swear by Mah	70.6725082397461
3296/28840	Devil take me if Ive ever been so happy as at this	75.4088134765625
3297/28840	And he wiped his eyes still	55.299560546875
3298/28840	Has not one of you a cross asked Ath	92.44952392578125
3299/28840	Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pear	36.11499786376953
3300/28840	Ah traitor muttered DArtagnan leaning toward Aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Fronde	32.58527374267578
3301/28840	We hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to F	57.152244567871094
3302/28840	In losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican Raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from Olivain the emotion his face might	47.124229431152344
3303/28840	With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had	63.62345504760742
3304/28840	Very well sir said the host Ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the	39.257755279541016
3305/28840	Do as you like said Raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant	56.4951286315918
3306/28840	The host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the	94.60594177246094
3307/28840	By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul began to	88.82889556884766
3308/28840	The host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of	53.44755554199219
3309/28840	Beauty has always been and always will be all	174.58999633789062
3310/28840	Hes not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to Olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no	61.42863082885742
3311/28840	My master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do he lost it the day before	142.894775390625
3312/28840	I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward	63.092193603515625
3313/28840	You will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in	47.35166931152344
3314/28840	I entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if I may venture to tell you so I also feel	29.714693069458008
3315/28840	It seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which I did not dare to question you since you told me	37.641727447509766
3316/28840	I have therefore as you see great need of hearing from	93.89420318603516
3317/28840	Now that you are no longer beside me I am afraid every moment of er	46.13870620727539
3318/28840	You sustained me powerfully sir and I protest to you that today I feel very	89.06424713134766
3319/28840	During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also	85.81879425048828
3320/28840	Raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at Sen	56.04206466674805
3321/28840	The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round	94.96842193603516
3322/28840	Let us try and overtake this gentleman said Raoul to Olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable	57.42646026611328
3323/28840	It was about four oclock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of	25.274059295654297
3324/28840	He had stopped like Raoul at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle the best at Compiegne and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at Noy	32.73566436767578
3325/28840	Well let us sleep at Noyon said Ra	23.25847053527832
3326/28840	Sir replied Olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this	43.45519256591797
3327/28840	I think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early	57.07321548461914
3328/28840	Eighteen leagues is enough for the first	162.6156005859375
3329/28840	The horses will have a long nights rest and at five oclock tomorrow morning we can be again on the	34.78176498413086
3330/28840	Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master gr	652.438720703125
3331/28840	Go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day tomorrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after tomorrow five and in three days you will be in	52.88731384277344
3332/28840	There you must rest young people are such bragg	138.2330780029297
3333/28840	It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the Planchets and the Grimaud	25.765750885009766
3334/28840	Raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his	55.54920196533203
3335/28840	DArtagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with	53.19259262084961
3336/28840	A little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to	47.66099166870117
3337/28840	Raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for Oliv	52.935340881347656
3338/28840	At this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the	35.05103302001953
3339/28840	Raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his	40.434059143066406
3340/28840	Olivain he exclaimed what do I see below there   A second scream more piercing than the first now	237.42922973632812
3341/28840	Oh sir cried Olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is	54.25941848754883
3342/28840	But what do I see in the watersomething struggling   Oh yes exclaimed Raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider   They are sinking cried Olivain in his	31.881332397460938
3343/28840	Ah sir cried Olivain what are you doing Good God   Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in	30.235633850097656
3344/28840	This was in fact a custom familiar to	54.70379638671875
3345/28840	Having been brought up on the banks of the Loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum	41.18185806274414
3346/28840	Athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undert	53.88844299316406
3347/28840	Oh heavens continued Olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now   The count would do as I do replied Raoul urging his horse vigorously	56.211875915527344
3348/28840	A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but	63.28795623779297
3349/28840	Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently	91.10749816894531
3350/28840	The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms	44.6014404296875
3351/28840	One moment longer and all would	744.45458984375
3352/28840	Courage cried Raoul courage   Too late murmured the young man too late   The water closed above his head and stifled his	37.00925064086914
3353/28840	Raoul at the same time seized one of the young mans hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning	37.798011779785156
3354/28840	Thus sure that the rider would not release his hold Raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with	84.01376342773438
3355/28840	All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the	56.61499786376953
3356/28840	Saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched	431.4528503417969
3357/28840	A moment later the grayheaded man was beside	120.6103286743164
3358/28840	Olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the	81.7185287475586
3359/28840	Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved	28.37578773498535
3360/28840	Ah sir he exclaimed it was you Without you I was a dead manthrice	59.477352142333984
3361/28840	But one recovers sir as you perceive replied Raoul and we have but had a little	86.5419692993164
3362/28840	Oh sir what gratitude I feel exclaimed the man with gray	125.1361083984375
3363/28840	Ah there you are my good DArminges I have given you a great fright have I not but it is your own	41.925540924072266
3364/28840	You were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim   Oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal	21.256793975830078
3365/28840	But how did the accident happen asked Ra	56.28410720825195
3366/28840	Oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of	65.71702575683594
3367/28840	We were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat	63.78910446166992
3368/28840	Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the	69.09920501708984
3369/28840	I cannot swim and dared not throw myself into the	43.989681243896484
3370/28840	Sir replied Raoul bowing I am entirely at your service I assure	13.709277153015137
3371/28840	I am called the Count de Guiche continued the young man my father is the Marechal de Grammont and now that you know who I am do me the honor to inform me who you	16.566333770751953
3372/28840	I am the Viscount de Bragelonne answered Raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the Count de Guiche had	15.560845375061035
3373/28840	Viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already	149.75595092773438
3374/28840	Sir said Raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand I like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend I beseech	41.92169952392578
3375/28840	And now where are you going viscount inquired De Gu	20.79012680053711
3376/28840	To join the army under the prince	520.982666015625
3377/28840	And I too exclaimed the young man in a transport of	28.291778564453125
3378/28840	Oh so much the better we will fire the first shot	33.34260177612305
3379/28840	It is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to	137.29527282714844
3380/28840	And now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom I gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the	62.23829650878906
3381/28840	Linen and wine are both being warmed	1229.560791015625
3382/28840	The young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very	50.250083923339844
3383/28840	They mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between	175.96560668945312
3384/28840	They were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent	161.70989990234375
3385/28840	De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than Raoul who was only	20.22951316833496
3386/28840	The halt at Noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound	126.22067260742188
3387/28840	Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive but Grimaud did not	91.78984832763672
3388/28840	Doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted	124.61870574951172
3389/28840	The Count de Guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by Raoul who came to wish him good	30.09505844116211
3390/28840	They breakfasted in haste and at six oclock had already gone ten	57.704463958740234
3391/28840	The young counts conversation was most interesting to Raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and	252.9137725830078
3392/28840	Scarrons house he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen	84.99217987060547
3393/28840	Guiche knew everybodyMadame de Neuillan Mademoiselle dAubigne Mademoiselle de Scudery Mademoiselle Paulet Madame de Chevre	14.692401885986328
3394/28840	Raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her	57.2426872253418
3395/28840	Then came the question of gallantry and love	348.8005676269531
3396/28840	Under this head also Bragelonne had much more to hear than to	94.12820434570312
3397/28840	He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his	44.344295501708984
3398/28840	De Guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to	22.225013732910156
3399/28840	The young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of	86.23944091796875
3400/28840	The day passed away as rapidly as an	57.061485290527344
3401/28840	The horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at Arras at four oclock in the	34.98890686035156
3402/28840	They were approaching the scene of war and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras they determined to remain in the town until the mor	46.708858489990234
3403/28840	The French army held all between PontaMarc as far as Valenciennes falling back upon Dou	98.74687194824219
3404/28840	The prince was said to be in person at Beth	44.11193084716797
3405/28840	An approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached	105.96924591064453
3406/28840	The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportune	66.28720092773438
3407/28840	The evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the	70.96575927734375
3408/28840	In the morning it was rumored that Prince de Condé had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former	44.549015045166016
3409/28840	But as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if	69.1971664428711
3410/28840	The counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of Lens and that of Beth	52.363136291503906
3411/28840	They obtained information at Ablain and a statement of their route was left for Grim	252.3567352294922
3412/28840	About seven oclock in the morning they set	17.878631591796875
3413/28840	De Guiche who was young and impulsive said to Raoul Here we are three masters and three	49.431610107421875
3414/28840	Our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough	72.66553497314453
3415/28840	I have never seen him put to the test replied Raoul but he is a Breton which promises	53.0699577331543
3416/28840	Yes yes resumed De Guiche I am sure he can fire a musket when	73.56529998779297
3417/28840	On my side I have two sure men who have been in action with my	53.6176872253418
3418/28840	We therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them Raoul   Certainly sir replied the vis	66.2630615234375

3422/28840	Therefore leaving directions at every place for Grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the	50.707027435302734

3424/28840	Here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were	108.61074829101562
3425/28840	In anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band thus forming the advance	75.22977447509766
3426/28840	Himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst Olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the	56.955196380615234
3427/28840	They had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it Monsieur dArminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the counts two gro	41.04277801513672
3428/28840	The servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards	35.741790771484375
3429/28840	Olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six muskets	114.23382568359375
3430/28840	The tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gall	31.540794372558594
3431/28840	The young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the	92.60191345214844
3432/28840	Were you stopped eagerly inquired the two	286.9407043457031
3433/28840	No replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your	23.77019500732422
3434/28840	My advice is this said Monsieur dArminges and if needs be my will that we beat a	49.46004867553711

3439/28840	The two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were	31.3463077545166
3440/28840	Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready	282.6303405761719
3441/28840	In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced	34.96161651611328

3450/28840	The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered	109.84329223632812
3451/28840	De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the Spaniard who had advanced to meet Raoul aimed in his turn and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a	41.420249938964844
3452/28840	He let off his fire at but four p	220.58953857421875
3453/28840	Struck in the breast and extending his arms the Spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him	46.049625396728516
3454/28840	Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of Athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was	44.9968376159668
3455/28840	His horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling Raouls leg under its	194.2571258544922
3456/28840	The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike Raoul on the head with the	39.69408416748047
3457/28840	In the position in which Raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their hol	28.591087341308594
3458/28840	The butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard and placed a pistol at his	42.97449493408203

3460/28840	Guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached Ra	71.91665649414062
3461/28840	Faith sir said Raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to	40.18415069580078

3463/28840	My antagonist took flight replied De Guiche and left me at liberty to come to your	82.06336212158203
3464/28840	But are you seriously wounded I see you are covered with blood   I believe said Raoul that I have got something like a scratch on the	42.512393951416016

3467/28840	At last Raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet	77.08158111572266
3468/28840	Faith no thank Heaven replied Raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering   I fear we arrived too	38.0406379699707
3469/28840	They have killed them I think and taken flight carrying off their boot	132.16143798828125
3470/28840	Let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested Ra	40.826446533203125

3472/28840	Take for yourself the better of the two and give me	128.22389221191406
3473/28840	They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims	75.69424438476562
3474/28840	Two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was	73.97016143798828
3475/28840	The other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to	50.2016716003418
3476/28840	He had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the	69.53215789794922

3484/28840	Where you can be relieved asked De Gu	44.20590591430664
3485/28840	But perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said Ra	37.682945251464844

3487/28840	Are you a surgeon asked De Gu	29.65184783935547
3488/28840	No but I know a little about wounds and mine I know is	90.2016372680664
3489/28840	Try therefore either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me	70.49581146240234
3490/28840	It is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is	86.18714904785156

3495/28840	My God my God Good God good God added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that that would be too terrible   Calm yourself sir replied De Gu	38.696903228759766

3508/28840	The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the	38.11912155151367
3509/28840	Raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything need	47.92969512939453
3510/28840	He desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the	164.69134521484375
3511/28840	The host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward Gre	79.93357849121094
3512/28840	Chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously	159.7149200439453
3513/28840	He was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much older from ascetic	34.218040466308594
3514/28840	Sir began Raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic   Why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely	26.509925842285156
3515/28840	Because we want to know said De Guiche haught	24.764415740966797
3516/28840	The stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his	107.70542907714844
3517/28840	In a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his	66.43849182128906
3518/28840	Answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an	99.10675811767578
3519/28840	I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask	51.865299224853516
3520/28840	It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monks	96.5486831665039
3521/28840	In the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Gu	23.018779754638672
3522/28840	Nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the	80.31476593017578
3523/28840	The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that Raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an	33.748226165771484
3524/28840	He is some Spanish or Flemish spy said he putting his hand to his	36.73931884765625
3525/28840	A glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to Ra	193.513916015625
3526/28840	Well sir said De Guiche are you going to reply   I am a priest said the young	8.616474151611328
3527/28840	Then father said Raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your v	49.621238708496094
3528/28840	At the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of	63.25444030761719
3529/28840	The monks eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase I will goand he	198.36819458007812
3530/28840	Let us follow him said De Guiche it will be the surest	68.5059814453125
3531/28840	I was about to propose so doing answered De Bragel	25.991409301757812
3532/28840	In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or	29.53207778930664
3533/28840	You see said Raoul we have done	70.65980529785156
3534/28840	What a horrible face that monk has said De Gu	123.92735290527344

3536/28840	I confess I am accustomed to priests of a very different	75.45683288574219

3538/28840	As ugly   No but reasonably	355.521484375
3539/28840	What a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar   Pshaw said De Gu	24.426774978637695
3540/28840	Absolution comes not from him who administers it but from	186.7846221923828
3541/28840	However for my part I would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a conf	30.69256019592285
3542/28840	You are of my opinion are you not viscount and I see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy fathers	31.585601806640625
3543/28840	Yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder	26.99480628967285
3544/28840	Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path   Never answered De Gu	74.28797149658203
3545/28840	Well I vow I felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said Why do you ask me that and looked so strangely at	66.62091064453125
3546/28840	Then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels   Faith yes almost said Ra	70.76183319091797
3547/28840	They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur dArming	26.5902042388916
3548/28840	There is the wounded man said De Guiche passing close to the Augustine	31.473682403564453
3549/28840	Be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur	90.1242446899414
3550/28840	As for Raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in rep	70.93155670166016
3551/28840	The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the	32.22252655029297

3574/28840	Render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritor	60.74493408203125
3575/28840	The monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a	40.322906494140625
3576/28840	DArminges and Olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his	25.99201011657715
3577/28840	Just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the	28.998703002929688
3578/28840	What does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just	69.28975677490234
3579/28840	The traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing	26.736841201782227
3580/28840	Ah diable said the host to himself this man seems	181.5315399169922
3581/28840	And where will your worship drink   There answered the traveler pointing to the	40.28788757324219
3582/28840	I was mistaken said the host hes not quite	46.00416946411133
3583/28840	And what else does your worship wish for   To know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom   The Viscount de Bragelonne   Just	13.40668773651123
3584/28840	Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud   The traveler made a sign of ass	15.839117050170898
3585/28840	Well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambr	18.4902400970459
3586/28840	How far is Mazingarbe   Two miles and a	52.06501388549805
3587/28840	Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying	58.67746353149414
3588/28840	What is that said he whence comes that cry   From the wounded mans room replied the	60.23705291748047
3589/28840	What wounded man   The former executioner of Bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by Spaniards and who is now being confessed by an Augustine fri	25.665422439575195
3590/28840	The old executioner of Bethune muttered Grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard   That is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the	32.604408264160156
3591/28840	I have seen him once replied Grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of	79.5195083618164
3592/28840	At this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was	64.8852767944336
3593/28840	The three listeners looked at one another in	204.6062469482422
3594/28840	We must see what it is said Grim	30.030487060546875
3595/28840	It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the	74.56724548339844
3596/28840	Mon Dieu said the woman crossing	166.3335418701172
3597/28840	If Grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other	51.479888916015625
3598/28840	Open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk   No	156.3410186767578
3599/28840	Unfasten it or I will break it in said Grim	129.94851684570312
3600/28840	The same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the	51.0781135559082
3601/28840	The room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had	57.99252700805664
3602/28840	The monk cried the host where is the monk   Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the	21.401241302490234
3603/28840	He has escaped by this means exclaimed	175.50672912597656
3604/28840	Do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the	48.23052215576172
3605/28840	There is no mule cried he to whom this question was	76.2894515991211
3606/28840	The host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst Grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the	30.443580627441406
3607/28840	There can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said	43.653282165527344
3608/28840	Does he still live inquired the inn	118.83355712890625
3609/28840	Making no reply Grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming pall	61.6959114074707
3610/28840	The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the execution	53.96149826049805
3611/28840	Run run for help cried Grimaud and I will remain beside him	109.29141998291016
3612/28840	The host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands	41.00075149536133
3613/28840	This is what had taken place We have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a	37.12689208984375
3614/28840	Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing	53.9376220703125
3615/28840	He was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their	43.57143020629883
3616/28840	And besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as conf	87.91880798339844
3617/28840	The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded	24.462881088256836
3618/28840	The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to	21.83636474609375
3619/28840	He made a movement of surprise and said   Father you are very	30.699886322021484
3620/28840	Men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dry	198.15255737304688
3621/28840	Alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments I need a	143.50961303710938
3622/28840	Do you suffer much asked the	82.40824127197266
3623/28840	Yes but in my soul much more than in my	73.53791046142578
3624/28840	I still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno	366.0060729980469
3625/28840	Tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely	56.75070571899414
3626/28840	That is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession I have distributed to the poor I have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing	46.603214263916016
3627/28840	All have forgiven me some have even loved me but I think that God has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that womans ghost rising before	50.39089584350586
3628/28840	A woman You have assassinated a woman then cried the	183.51939392089844
3629/28840	You also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my earsassassinated I have assassinated then and not executed I am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a gro	74.5909652709961
3630/28840	The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly   Go on I know nothing as yet when you have finished your story God and I will	57.95915985107422
3631/28840	The executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his	18.1135196685791
3632/28840	Delirium he repeated delirium do you say Oh no I remember too	62.2890625
3633/28840	It was evening I had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride	103.7785873413086
3634/28840	After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of	97.2454833984375
3635/28840	But let me see how was it done Speak said the	77.38127899169922
3636/28840	A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed	49.641414642333984
3637/28840	I reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem	222.11163330078125
3638/28840	We traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without	221.64517211914062
3639/28840	At length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be	62.75239944458008
3640/28840	And you obeyed   Father that woman was a	63.5955810546875
3641/28840	It was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brotherinlaw she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving England she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be	53.66106414794922
3642/28840	The woman was English then   No she was French but she had married in	69.5269546508789
3643/28840	The monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the	73.9114990234375
3644/28840	The executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his	49.974308013916016
3645/28840	No no I am here said the monk quickly coming back to	44.96987533569336

3651/28840	I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so	71.87908172607422
3652/28840	The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not	109.40169525146484
3653/28840	At length with a violent effort at selfcontrol   The name of that woman he	42.97935104370117

3658/28840	Oh yes it is she   A voice of strange sweetness   How do you know it   The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became l	19.095462799072266
3659/28840	And you killed her the monk	283.55120849609375

3661/28840	With your brother   Yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his	52.432369232177734
3662/28840	Oh father do not look in that way at me Oh I am guilty then you will not pardon me   The monk recovered his usual	48.975807189941406
3663/28840	Yes yes he said I will pardon you if you tell me	14.488639831542969

3671/28840	Her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name Speak or no absolution   The dying man collected all his	64.36612701416016
3672/28840	Anne de Bueil murmured the wounded	27.46999740600586
3673/28840	Anne de Bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to	34.70343017578125

3684/28840	The executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his	37.819671630859375
3685/28840	Grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his	57.2688102722168

3687/28840	Who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on Grim	43.210086822509766
3688/28840	You and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before	39.260162353515625
3689/28840	Under what circumstances did we meet he asked	105.88520050048828
3690/28840	One night twenty years ago my master fetched you from Bethune and conducted you to Armentie	48.651885986328125
3691/28840	I know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four gro	28.859609603881836
3692/28840	Where do you come from now   I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my	72.55529022216797
3693/28840	They told me the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing	71.46797180175781
3694/28840	At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it	67.21052551269531
3695/28840	And the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk   What monk   The monk that was shut in with	33.414878845214844
3696/28840	No he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the	30.939531326293945
3697/28840	Was he the man that stabbed you   Yes said the execution	45.628273010253906
3698/28840	Grimaud moved as if to leave the	118.37703704833984
3699/28840	What are you going to do asked the wounded	10.6226167678833
3700/28840	Do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done	61.039093017578125
3701/28840	Now I may hope that God will forgive me since my crime is exp	92.86151885986328
3702/28840	The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill   Milady   Yes Milady it is true you called her	72.1220932006836
3703/28840	What has the monk to do with this Milady   She was his	28.753429412841797
3704/28840	Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden	101.51056671142578
3705/28840	But does he know this secret then   I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in	66.32109832763672
3706/28840	Grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the	123.9614486694336
3707/28840	Touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn I shall	60.8634033203125
3708/28840	Grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed   Oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is	63.74821090698242
3709/28840	Haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends	125.46005249023438
3710/28840	My death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misad	31.732540130615234
3711/28840	Where was the monk going asked Grim	201.25372314453125
3712/28840	Who stopped him   Two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mentionthe Viscount de Bragel	29.792604446411133
3713/28840	And it was this young man who brought the monk to you Then it was the will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued Grim	45.821048736572266
3714/28840	And yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so   On ones deathbed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with ones own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his	59.70970916748047
3715/28840	Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la F	42.7337646484375
3716/28840	Whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the	76.68476867675781
3717/28840	The surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have f	38.9566650390625
3718/28840	We must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant	61.54414749145508
3719/28840	The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud who turned away his	36.96998977661133
3720/28840	The weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly fright	47.73246765136719
3721/28840	Then Grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his	49.01172637939453
3722/28840	Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself travelstained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy execution	32.639095306396484
3723/28840	Grimaud my good Grimaud exclaimed Raoul here you are at last Excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a	53.93939971923828
3724/28840	How did you leave the count continued	72.42131805419922

3728/28840	I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would	50.784542083740234
3729/28840	At the mention of the monk Grimaud became	88.49443817138672
3730/28840	Come come continued DArminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a rep	67.72196960449219
3731/28840	Come Grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can	102.36338806152344
3732/28840	I cannot stop a moment I must start for Paris again	140.5826416015625
3733/28840	What You start for Paris You are mistaken it is Olivain who leaves me you are to	61.04584884643555
3734/28840	On the contrary Olivain is to stay and I am to	62.33378219604492
3735/28840	I have come for nothing else but to tell you	26.800907135009766
3736/28840	But what is the meaning of this change   I cannot tell	14.43738842010498
3737/28840	Come tell me what is the joke   Monsieur le vicomte knows that I never	17.92584228515625
3738/28840	Yes but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to	15.321577072143555
3739/28840	Perhaps you mean to disobey me   Yes monsieur I	14.825698852539062
3740/28840	You persist then   Yes I am going may you be happy monsieur and Grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go	35.802371978759766
3741/28840	Raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the	53.58678436279297
3742/28840	Grimaud he cried remain I wish	528.7521362304688
3743/28840	Then replied Grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be	16.646434783935547
3744/28840	He saluted and made a movement to	80.92908477783203
3745/28840	Grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety Speak speak in Heavens name And Raoul fell back trembling upon his	59.09691619873047
3746/28840	I can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my	25.434144973754883
3747/28840	You met a monk did you not  	65.73683166503906
3748/28840	The young men looked at each other with an expression of	9.416502952575684
3749/28840	You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet	35.981998443603516
3750/28840	And without adding another word Grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the	45.02654266357422
3751/28840	Two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was Grimaud on his way to	37.304996490478516
3752/28840	When once in the saddle Grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no	79.39197540283203
3753/28840	But Grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post	64.73406219482422
3754/28840	Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out The Spaniards the Spaniards   That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccup	49.339962005615234
3755/28840	The young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of Houdin and Beth	54.187591552734375
3756/28840	While Monsieur dArminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body of infantry and	27.25974464416504
3757/28840	This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire	62.989986419677734
3758/28840	There was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur dArminges and beat a	27.213607788085938
3759/28840	Olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his	105.32066345214844
3760/28840	As a further precaution they had bound his	174.9459991455078
3761/28840	The little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin where they expected to find the	26.733869552612305
3762/28840	But he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemys	33.06003189086914
3763/28840	He questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been	118.89164733886719
3764/28840	The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of	111.29341888427734
3765/28840	Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely	96.7408447265625
3766/28840	The prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to Marshal de Grammont that some one wished to see	36.098876953125
3767/28840	The Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went	46.93674850463867
3768/28840	The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing	29.653440475463867
3769/28840	Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was	57.539085388183594
3770/28840	The prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking itit was the noise of	33.188350677490234
3771/28840	The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the	48.184478759765625
3772/28840	Speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual	145.76254272460938
3773/28840	The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is	66.12591552734375
3774/28840	It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his	51.95718002319336
3775/28840	Besides he had long known the prince whilst Raoul now saw him for the first	40.7998046875
3776/28840	He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingar	36.88093185424805
3777/28840	Meanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of Rocroy Fribourg and Nordling	82.95752716064453
3778/28840	At the first words of the Count de Guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood	53.77336120605469
3779/28840	The enemy was marching upon Lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from France the army of	85.19530487060547
3780/28840	But in what force was the enemy Was it a corps sent out to make a diversion Was it an entire army To this question De Guiche could not	73.29194641113281
3781/28840	Now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise	163.44142150878906
3782/28840	Certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a	46.58049011230469
3783/28840	My lord said Raoul blushing might examine the Spanish	51.629356384277344
3784/28840	Have you a Spanish prisoner cried the	80.34919738769531
3785/28840	Ah that is true said De Guiche I had forgotten	24.1170597076416
3786/28840	That is easily understood it was you who took him count said Raoul	59.29676818847656
3787/28840	The old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed   The young man is right let the prisoner be brought	46.725555419921875
3788/28840	Meanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man	35.94355392456055
3789/28840	Monsieur said the prince turning toward Raoul I know that you have a letter from my sister Madame de Longueville but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good	19.721359252929688
3790/28840	My lord said Raoul coloring up I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the	34.330867767333984
3791/28840	Very well said the prince give it to me	83.68128204345703
3792/28840	Here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most	170.84523010253906
3793/28840	The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spo	49.54957580566406
3794/28840	Since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he	31.49800682067871
3795/28840	The prince looked at him with unspeakable	17.348554611206055
3796/28840	Of what country are you asked the	42.80900192260742
3797/28840	The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign	52.37540817260742
3798/28840	Ah ah it seems that he is a Spani	52.75266647338867
3799/28840	Do you speak Spanish Grammont   Faith my lord but indifferent	27.108274459838867
3800/28840	And I not at all said the prince	40.62799072265625
3801/28840	Gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak Spanish and serve me as interpreter   I can my lord said Ra	75.02937316894531
3802/28840	Ah you speak Spanish   Enough I think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this	82.65023040771484
3803/28840	Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking	26.621978759765625
3804/28840	My lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest Cast	41.26304626464844
3805/28840	Ich bin ein Deutscher replied the	1224.559326171875
3806/28840	What in the devil does he say asked the	34.58400344848633
3807/28840	What new gibberish is that   He says he is German my lord replied Raoul but I doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation	49.18299102783203
3808/28840	Then you speak German also asked the	291.9598083496094
3809/28840	Well enough to question him in that language   Yes my	33.667720794677734
3810/28840	Raoul began the examination but the result justified his	436.33099365234375
3811/28840	The prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what Raoul said to him and Raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsat	41.61841583251953
3812/28840	However amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination Raoul had recognized his natural	91.10758209228516
3813/28840	Non siete Spagnuolo he said non siete Tedesco siete Italian	120.19649505615234
3814/28840	The prisoner started and bit his	64.03782653808594
3815/28840	Ah that said the prince I understand that language thoroughly and since he is Italian I will myself continue the	104.54924774169922
3816/28840	Thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and I appoint you from this moment my	62.11077880859375
3817/28840	But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the	86.45939636230469
3818/28840	Therefore he knew nothing either of the enemys numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the	44.05662536621094
3819/28840	Very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he doesnt wish to	72.55691528320312
3820/28840	The two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to Marshal de Grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had	34.72609329223633
3821/28840	When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner	33.03191375732422
3822/28840	The soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him	144.12901306152344
3823/28840	One moment said the prisoner in	323.778564453125
3824/28840	I am ready to speak my	21.654787063598633
3825/28840	Ah ah said the prince laughing I thought we should come to	41.50373458862305
3826/28840	I have a sure method of limbering	57.31391525268555
3827/28840	Young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in	82.88809204101562
3828/28840	But on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be	72.04334259033203
3829/28840	Where did the army cross the Lys   Between SaintVenant and A	173.41644287109375
3830/28840	By whom is it commanded   By Count de Fuonsaldagna General Beck and the archdu	69.73556518554688
3831/28840	Of how many does it consist   Eighteen thousand men and thirtysix	35.883365631103516
3832/28840	And its aim is  	463.3835144042969
3833/28840	You see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other	33.31479263305664
3834/28840	Yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human	41.92060089111328
3835/28840	Recall Le Plessis Bellievre Villequier and DErlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the	91.2887954711914
3836/28840	Let them hold themselves in readiness to march	357.1558837890625
3837/28840	Tomorrow according to all probability we shall attack the	49.65071487426758
3838/28840	But my lord said Marshal de Grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand	29.332321166992188
3839/28840	Monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are	42.316165924072266
3840/28840	Then turning toward the prisoner Take away that man he said and keep him carefully in	151.86009216308594
3841/28840	His life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be	69.272705078125
3842/28840	Count de Guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with	25.67315673828125
3843/28840	Monsieur he continued addressing Raoul if you are not too tired follow	32.03778076171875
3844/28840	To the end of the world my lord cried Raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his	48.52605056762695
3845/28840	The prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated	72.0218734741211
3846/28840	Come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in	29.426328659057617
3847/28840	And I said the marshal what am I to do   Wait here to receive the	33.555843353271484
3848/28840	I shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to	62.28059768676758
3849/28840	Twenty guards well mounted are all that I shall need for my	102.08344268798828
3850/28840	That is very few said the marsh	52.165069580078125
3851/28840	Have you a good horse Monsieur de Bragelonne   My horse was killed this morning my lord and I am mounted provisionally on my lac	21.729907989501953
3852/28840	Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like	86.21998596191406
3853/28840	No false modesty take the best horse you can	61.80326461791992
3854/28840	You will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it	97.24177551269531
3855/28840	Now monsieur he said to Raoul will you give me the letter you have brought   Raoul handed the letter to the	13.497570037841797
3856/28840	The prince read as he hastened	118.20426940917969
3857/28840	Monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of	46.421051025390625
3858/28840	I have only to say after the little that I have seen and heard that I think even better of you than I have been	35.022560119628906
3859/28840	Meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to Lens the noise of the cannon sounded	32.87700653076172
3860/28840	The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of	58.53343963623047
3861/28840	One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his	84.33064270019531
3862/28840	From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a	67.27427673339844
3863/28840	At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of Aun	32.72624588012695
3864/28840	The report of Spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was	101.05828094482422
3865/28840	The women had already fled taking refuge in Vitry only a few men	134.2452392578125
3866/28840	On seeing the prince they hastened to meet	37.640750885009766
3867/28840	Ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robbers   Yes said the prince if you will serve me as	24.20435905456543
3868/28840	Where does your highness wish to go   To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surrounding country   In that case Im your	53.10106658935547
3869/28840	I can trust youyou are a true Frenchman   I am an old soldier of Rocroy my	22.635845184326172
3870/28840	Here said the prince handing him a purse here is for Roc	81.49209594726562
3871/28840	Now do you want a horse or will you go afoot   Afoot my lord I have served always in the	47.92951965332031
3872/28840	Besides I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to	56.3532829284668
3873/28840	Come then said the prince let us lose no	19.706117630004883
3874/28840	The peasant started off running before the princes horse then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the	60.75492858886719
3875/28840	For a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the	72.05121612548828
3876/28840	At length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountains	137.4965362548828
3877/28840	The prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the	49.05512237548828
3878/28840	He then began to ascend the	58.04708480834961
3879/28840	In about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding	29.42334747314453
3880/28840	At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on Lens at bay and before Lens the enemys entire	45.0369873046875
3881/28840	With a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from Lens as far as Vim	101.00566864013672
3882/28840	In a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save France the second time from invasion was unrolled in his	50.813236236572266
3883/28840	He took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote   My Dear MarshalIn an hour Lens will be in the enemys	35.57121658325195
3884/28840	Come and rejoin me bring with you the whole	47.344886779785156
3885/28840	I shall be at Vendin to place it in	123.48075866699219
3886/28840	Tomorrow we shall retake Lens and beat the	81.56413269042969
3887/28840	Then turning toward Raoul Go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Gram	25.645536422729492

3889/28840	A quarter of an hour later he was with the marsh	28.72801971435547
3890/28840	A portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to	90.45161437988281
3891/28840	Marshal de Grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to Vendin leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the	41.21279525756836
3892/28840	All the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments	98.62480926513672
3893/28840	It was seven oclock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed	12.919940948486328
3894/28840	As he had foreseen Lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raouls	36.78242874145508
3895/28840	The event was announced by the cessation of the	66.64334106445312
3896/28840	As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detach	142.74325561523438
3897/28840	Orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet	290.025146484375
3898/28840	At nine oclock the night had fully	85.73368072509766
3899/28840	Still a last ray of twilight lighted the	72.21359252929688
3900/28840	The army marched silently the prince at the head of the	88.5857162475586
3901/28840	Presently the army came in sight of Lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by	80.69671630859375
3902/28840	The prince assigned to every one his	210.1274871826172
3903/28840	Marshal de Grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on Meric	137.90139770507812
3904/28840	The Duc de Chatillon commanded the	48.213714599609375
3905/28840	Finally the prince led the right wing resting on Aun	138.06344604492188
3906/28840	The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the	49.658058166503906
3907/28840	Each one on awaking would find himself on the field of	50.889617919921875
3908/28840	The movement was executed in silence and with	181.44473266601562
3909/28840	At ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at halfpast ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following	43.927371978759766
3910/28840	The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept Bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded	33.948734283447266
3911/28840	A tent was erected for them near that of the marsh	152.260498046875
3912/28840	Although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to	44.271366119384766
3913/28840	And besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible	65.67169952392578
3914/28840	On the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become	92.58914947509766
3915/28840	It need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is	73.72972106933594
3916/28840	Some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to	48.12994384765625
3917/28840	The letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written	308.55059814453125
3918/28840	The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and	92.96949005126953
3919/28840	The letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their	92.9963150024414
3920/28840	In case any evil should happen to me said Bragel	61.09401321411133
3921/28840	In case I should be killed said De Gu	29.70549774169922
3922/28840	They then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and	79.40878295898438
3923/28840	The second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the	59.3472900390625
3924/28840	The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday at eight oclock in the evening	30.79776382446289
3925/28840	On that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or	58.66358947753906
3926/28840	The first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of	45.616233825683594
3927/28840	Athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of	161.34034729003906
3928/28840	At this order given in Athoss habitually calm manner the face of the Gascon relaxed and Porthoss brow grew	54.934688568115234
3929/28840	He knew that Athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to	40.13339614868164
3930/28840	This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former	68.22074890136719
3931/28840	In a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their	62.96656036376953
3932/28840	Now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the	130.1414337158203
3933/28840	Soonstrange factAramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which Porthos unfastened his	56.63108825683594
3934/28840	Battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great	109.41761016845703
3935/28840	A great prince said Aramis with whom Mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with	47.77050018310547
3936/28840	The prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent	52.1579475402832
3937/28840	In this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce	56.976844787597656
3938/28840	What did Mazarin do   Stormed suggested Ath	59.412811279296875
3939/28840	You have guessed it answered Aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were	53.490501403808594
3940/28840	At last their hilarity calmed down and   Faith exclaimed DArtagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to Mazarin for I assure you on his side he wishes you no	64.87249755859375
3941/28840	If I thought the fellow knew me by my name I would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought I knew	57.536231994628906
3942/28840	He knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them I can answer for	27.743118286132812
3943/28840	By whom   By me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any	25.129558563232422
3944/28840	And what did you reply   That I had none as yet but that I was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me	32.073158264160156
3945/28840	You told him that said Porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest	64.40119171142578
3946/28840	Bravo and you are not afraid of that Athos   No replied Athos it is not the search of Mazarin that I	29.64920425415039
3947/28840	Now said Aramis tell me a little what you do	38.7238883972168
3948/28840	Nothing for the present at least nothing in good	225.16412353515625
3949/28840	And with regard to the past asked Porth	21.02608871459961
3950/28840	Oh the past is another thing said Athos sighing the past and the	43.9642333984375
3951/28840	Are you afraid for your young Raoul asked Aram	48.63241195678711
3952/28840	Well said DArtagnan one is never killed in a first	38.04907989501953
3953/28840	Well I shall look upon it as an exp	29.318288803100586
3954/28840	Ah said DArtagnan I know what you	7.561066150665283
3955/28840	And I too added Aramis but you must not think of that Athos what is past is	44.020328521728516
3956/28840	The affair at Armentieres asked he	69.15385437011719
3957/28840	Oh yes said Porthos true I had forgotten it   Athos looked at him int	21.6214656829834
3958/28840	You have forgotten it Porthos said	65.38741302490234
3959/28840	Faith yes it is so long ago answered Porth	30.48501205444336
3960/28840	This affair does not then weigh upon your conscience   Faith	64.79700469970703
3961/28840	And you DArtagnan   II own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancie	47.257080078125
3962/28840	Yes yes murmured he I have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the	62.300201416015625
3963/28840	Consider said Aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of	93.33304595947266
3964/28840	We were but the instruments that is	153.24562072753906
3965/28840	But as to free will Aramis   How acts the judge He has a free will yet he fearlessly	171.27369689941406
3966/28840	What does the executioner He is master of his arm yet he strikes without	134.48748779296875
3967/28840	The executioner muttered Athos as if arrested by some	94.08647155761719
3968/28840	As for me said Porthos now that you have reminded me of it Athos I have the scene again before me as if I now were	38.70329666137695
3969/28840	Milady was there as it were where you	456.7723388671875
3970/28840	I wore a long sword which cut like a Damascusyou remember it Aramis for you always called it Balizard	64.9739761352539
3971/28840	Upon my honor and by the holy cross I only regret it because she was a	68.45184326171875
3972/28840	The most satisfactory part of the matter said DArtagnan is that there remains no trace of	26.378490447998047
3973/28840	Then said Athos woe to De Winter for the child had done no	41.92912673950195
3974/28840	May the devil take me if the child be not dead said Porth	22.900508880615234
3975/28840	There is so much fog in that detestable country at least so DArtagnan	27.177156448364258
3976/28840	Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the	42.31766128540039
3977/28840	Please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of	60.88772964477539
3978/28840	To which of us asked all the four	115.73070526123047
3979/28840	To him who is called the Comte de la F	6.883543968200684
3980/28840	It is I said Athos and what is the name of the person   Grim	15.95215892791748
3981/28840	Back already What can have happened then to Bragelonne   Let him enter cried DArtagnan let him come	25.681306838989258
3982/28840	But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave	29.24875831604004
3983/28840	The door being closed the four friends waited in	133.62962341308594
3984/28840	Grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible	113.3088607788086
3985/28840	Your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon youbeware   Athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy	71.88192749023438
3986/28840	Porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall Aramis seized his knife DArtagnan	22.32438850402832
3987/28840	What do you mean Grimaud he	34.79808807373047
3988/28840	That Miladys son has left England that he is in France on his road to Paris if he be not here	42.46340560913086
3989/28840	Are you sure of it   Certain replied Grim	20.543888092041016
3990/28840	Grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a	98.02234649658203
3991/28840	Athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to	96.5592269897461
3992/28840	Well after all said DArtagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to Paris we have seen many other	39.18304443359375
3993/28840	Yes echoed Porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him	45.51338577270508
3994/28840	Moreover he is but a child said Aram	38.28799057006836
3995/28840	Do you know what he has done this child Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of Bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his	33.896907806396484
3996/28840	See it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the	77.7148208618164
3997/28840	And Grimaud threw the dagger on the	42.93903732299805
3998/28840	DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their	20.46800994873047
3999/28840	Athos alone remained seated calm and	123.24834442138672
4000/28840	And you say he is dressed as a monk Grimaud   Yes as an Augustine	45.8461799621582
4001/28840	What sized man is he   About my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen	55.871620178222656
4002/28840	And he did not see Raoul asked Ath	17.890851974487305
4003/28840	Yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying	22.942583084106445
4004/28840	Athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his	68.49555969238281
4005/28840	And very soon they left the	133.5146026611328

4144/28840	Observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying   Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time Let us see what this letter	60.805301666259766
4145/28840	We here present the letter verbatim   To his Eminence Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini   I have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in	36.87367630004883
4146/28840	The two kingdoms are so near that France must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of	42.38241195678711
4147/28840	The English are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of Charles and his	135.43019104003906
4148/28840	Placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable	68.51405334472656
4149/28840	I am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King	40.99215316772461
4150/28840	I shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are with	51.1500358581543
4151/28840	This battle won by me the king will have no further resources in England or in Scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and	66.15679168701172
4152/28840	France has already received Queen Henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my	68.94021606445312
4153/28840	But Madame Henrietta is a daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of	32.63365936279297
4154/28840	As to King Charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him France will censure the acts of the English nation and thus so essentially harm England and especially the wellbeing of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced	83.10266876220703
4155/28840	At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young	60.326759338378906
4156/28840	Mazarin resumed his reading   It is important therefore monseigneur that I should be informed as to the intentions of	67.46229553222656
4157/28840	The interests of that kingdom and those of England though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the	161.11386108398438

4160/28840	I have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government of	40.96662902832031
4161/28840	That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles from the territory of France and in refraining from helping hima stranger to your countrywith arms with money or with	145.2709197998047
4162/28840	My letter is private and confidential and for that reason I send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsel	67.15959167480469

4184/28840	You are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in England added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done	40.83834457397461
4185/28840	I am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like	47.736873626708984
4186/28840	Well then your eminence said the queen I must inform you that Charles	20.240333557128906

4194/28840	The perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarins	67.34263610839844

4205/28840	Oh madame said Mazarin your majesty knows not what you	21.560579299926758
4206/28840	On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own	34.66927719116211
4207/28840	To the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor If he comes to France will you accord him hospitality What do you intend to do	45.10619354248047
4208/28840	Madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech I shall convince your majesty I trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at	42.31625747680664
4209/28840	After which your majesty will I think no longer doubt my zeal in your	71.2847671508789
4210/28840	The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her	35.18718719482422
4211/28840	Well what do you propose to do she said at length come	62.45436477661133
4212/28840	I will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to	43.95562744140625
4213/28840	With which you are at waris it not so You will charge Broussel to report	141.3113250732422

4217/28840	It signifies little said Mazarin when he was	156.83120727539062
4218/28840	It gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but I have said nothing either to the one or to the	51.09883117675781
4219/28840	See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the	60.21275329589844
4220/28840	Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges who was on	44.969661712646484
4221/28840	Your eminence said Comminges as I was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by Raphael which is opposite the	55.47138214111328
4222/28840	He reflected for a second and then descended the	62.81928253173828
4223/28840	I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace	88.7669906616211
4224/28840	But is not your eminence going to the queen   For what purpose   Monsieur de Guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the	16.144197463989258
4225/28840	Comminges had seen rightly and Mordaunt had really acted as he had	85.55272674560547
4226/28840	In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived De Winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her	43.70130157470703
4227/28840	At this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of Raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible	76.89571380615234
4228/28840	His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his	51.9834098815918
4229/28840	He had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to	31.455162048339844
4230/28840	At last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and De Winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her	63.993682861328125
4231/28840	The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre which they	27.733945846557617
4232/28840	Before leaving the convent of the Carmelites Henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded	37.44749450683594
4233/28840	How sometimes the Unhappy mistake Chance for	503.5790710449219
4234/28840	Well madame said De Winter when the queen had dismissed her	23.753215789794922
4235/28840	Well my lord what I foresaw has come to	65.24913024902344
4236/28840	What does the cardinal refuse to receive the king France refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince Ay but it is for the first time madame   I did not say France my lord I said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a	37.67768859863281
4237/28840	But did you see the queen   It is useless replied Henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says	34.828102111816406
4238/28840	Are you not aware that this Italian directs everything both indoors and out And moreover I should not be surprised had we been forestalled by Crom	79.6546401977539
4239/28840	He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to	153.10159301757812
4240/28840	Then did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal the passing to and fro of busy people Can they have received any news my lord   Not from England mad	57.80649948120117
4241/28840	I made such haste that I am certain of not having been forest	29.7611026763916
4242/28840	I set out three days ago passing miraculously through the Puritan army and I took post horses with my servant Tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in	75.1014633178711
4243/28840	Besides the king I am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking	51.705047607421875
4244/28840	I shall go and die by his	31.63063621520996
4245/28840	Madame madame exclaimed De Winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some	97.8239974975586
4246/28840	What can be done with four   Four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom I speak performed great things at one	55.503448486328125
4247/28840	And where are these four men   Ah that is what I do not	14.245682716369629
4248/28840	It is twenty years since I saw them and yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of	30.577356338500977
4249/28840	And these men were your friends   One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to	21.394609451293945
4250/28840	I know not whether he is still my friend but since that time I have remained	45.70252990722656
4251/28840	And these men are in France my lord   I believe	24.034404754638672
4252/28840	Tell me their names perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding	58.59218978881836
4253/28840	One of them was called the Chevalier dArtagn	9.785938262939453
4254/28840	Ah my lord if I mistake not the Chevalier dArtagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for I fear that this man is entirely devoted to the	17.03806495666504
4255/28840	That would be a misfortune said De Winter and I shall begin to think that we are really	39.53384780883789
4256/28840	But the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his	48.89519500732422
4257/28840	The others my lord   The secondI heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the Comte de la F	52.719268798828125
4258/28840	As for the two others I had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their real	32.11280822753906
4259/28840	Oh mon Dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the	27.647506713867188
4260/28840	Oh yes said De Winter for they are the same	33.79190444946289
4261/28840	Have you never heard that Queen Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen   Yes at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and	46.831661224365234
4262/28840	Well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor I tell you you must not count on Monsieur dArtagn	38.230106353759766
4263/28840	Seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to England I will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave White	83.49211883544922
4264/28840	Seek them my lord and find them I conjure	112.24752807617188
4265/28840	I will search for them madame said De Winter and doubtless I shall find them but time fails	38.32072448730469
4266/28840	Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony   Then indeed we are lost cried the queen in the fullness of a broken	57.0074462890625
4267/28840	At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the	47.15485382080078
4268/28840	But that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young	29.94894790649414
4269/28840	She stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen   Why then do you always weep mother when I am away from you she	51.99711990356445
4270/28840	The queen smiled but instead of answering   See De Winter she said I have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of mad	59.1183967590332
4271/28840	Then turning toward her daughter   What do you want Henrietta she	47.67109680175781
4272/28840	I saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the Viscount de Bragel	13.72264575958252
4273/28840	The queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and Raoul appeared on the	23.683752059936523
4274/28840	Advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt	54.54629898071289
4275/28840	Madame said he I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the Count de Guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his	28.6843204498291
4276/28840	At the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of	26.871076583862305
4277/28840	You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont Henrietta said the	18.3756046295166
4278/28840	I thought so madame stammered the young	21.993818283081055
4279/28840	It is my fault madame said Ra	19.05046272277832
4280/28840	I did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche acted as his	38.39486312866211
4281/28840	There has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to Raoul to	65.48373413085938
4282/28840	At this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her	59.339027404785156
4283/28840	No madame replied Raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of	24.287229537963867
4284/28840	The young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their	48.28191375732422
4285/28840	Let us see said the queen what the count	88.6741714477539
4286/28840	If her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of	52.859703063964844
4287/28840	I have the honor to be with respect	48.3435173034668
4288/28840	The battle of Lens gained said the queen they are lucky here indeed they can gain battles Yes the Marechal de Grammont is right this will change the aspect of French affairs but I much fear it will do nothing for English even if it does not harm	74.0367202758789
4289/28840	This is recent news sir continued she and I thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter I should not have heard till tomorrow perhaps after tomorrowthe last of all	49.094703674316406
4290/28840	Madame said Raoul the Louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and I had sworn to the Count de Guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even I should embrace my	54.603118896484375
4291/28840	Your guardian is he too a Bragelonne asked Lord de	74.38108825683594

4293/28840	And your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name   The Comte de la Fere madame replied the young man b	14.161837577819824
4294/28840	De Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of	15.811898231506348
4295/28840	The Comte de la Fere she	7.846876621246338
4296/28840	Have you not mentioned that name to me   As for De Winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard ar	32.11817932128906
4297/28840	The Comte de la Fere he cried in his	7.975183963775635

4300/28840	Latterly I heard his friend Monsieur dArtagnan give him that	46.4967041015625
4301/28840	That is it madame that is the	25.362316131591797
4302/28840	God be praised And he is in Paris continued he addressing Raoul then turning to the queen We may still	49.73521423339844
4303/28840	Providence has declared for us since I have found this brave man again in so miraculous a	156.6952362060547
4304/28840	And sir where does he reside pray   The Comte de la Fere lodges in the Rue Guenegaud Hotel du Grand Roi Charlem	8.515634536743164
4305/28840	Inform this dear friend that he may remain within that I shall go and see him	139.40843200683594
4306/28840	Sir I obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to	66.24786376953125
4307/28840	Go Monsieur de Bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our	18.148509979248047
4308/28840	Raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to De Winter	112.79947662353516
4309/28840	The queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own	35.83108901977539
4310/28840	Then when De Winter rose to take leave   Listen my lord said the queen I have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of	38.783607482910156
4311/28840	They are worth about fifty thousand	46.8896598815918
4312/28840	I had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be	60.91569519042969
4313/28840	Take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my	88.95121765136719
4314/28840	Madame replied De Winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to	19.758031845092773
4315/28840	I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we	87.31939697265625
4316/28840	In an hour hence I shall be with the Comte de la Fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite	16.73567771911621
4317/28840	The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the Lou	48.5640983581543
4318/28840	It was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little	35.44090270996094
4319/28840	In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar	61.778045654296875
4320/28840	Tony he said motioning to his groom to	73.7930679321289
4321/28840	Did you remark that man who is following us   Yes my	38.6825065612793
4322/28840	Who is he   I do not know only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal stopped at the Louvre to wait for you and now leaves the Louvre with	24.668346405029297
4323/28840	Some spy of the cardinal said De Winter to him	136.00201416015625
4324/28840	Let us pretend not to notice that he is watching	111.37390899658203
4325/28840	And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the Marais for having for so long a time lived near the Place Royale Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient	64.28089141845703
4326/28840	The unknown spurred his horse to a gall	40.49994659423828
4327/28840	De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the	34.29694747924805
4328/28840	He turned around and Mordaunt stood before	36.6236572265625
4329/28840	There was a moment of frozen silence between these	66.26742553710938
4330/28840	Sir said De Winter I thought I had already made you aware that I am weary of this persecution withdraw then or I shall call and have you turned out as you were in	49.336299896240234
4331/28840	I am not your uncle I know you	27.055089950561523
4332/28840	My uncle replied Mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in Londonyou dare	51.121639251708984
4333/28840	As for denying that I am your nephew you will think twice about it now that I have learned some things of which I was ignorant a year	61.148223876953125
4334/28840	And how does it concern me what you have learned said De	31.024478912353516
4335/28840	Oh it concerns you very closely my uncle I am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus	48.80704116821289
4336/28840	Yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter and crossing his	33.4105110168457
4337/28840	I have asked the headsman of Bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and	49.328067779541016
4338/28840	And the headsman of Bethune gave me a	18.11968421936035
4339/28840	De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a	38.27872848510742
4340/28840	Yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key I open the	94.3298568725586

4347/28840	You desire to fathom this horrible secret said De Winter well then so be	182.7625274658203
4348/28840	Know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to	82.6344985961914
4349/28840	That woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my	44.88433074951172
4350/28840	What say you to that   I say that she was my	30.077070236206055
4351/28840	She caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and	73.68406677246094
4352/28840	What say you to that crime of which I have the proof   She was my	54.17591094970703
4353/28840	On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Beth	34.51856994628906
4354/28840	Will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this I have the proofs   She was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing	42.54890823364258

4359/28840	No replied Mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no I shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you I could not discover the	57.4721794128418
4360/28840	But when I have found them then tremble	95.99853515625
4361/28840	I stabbed to the heart the headsman of Bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you	49.66743850708008
4362/28840	With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his	58.517757415771484
4363/28840	But De Winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying   My God I thank Thee that he knows me	59.543556213378906
4364/28840	Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious	63.701263427734375
4365/28840	He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the	61.21459197998047
4366/28840	It almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to	205.5635223388672
4367/28840	Athos was happyhappy as he had never been	131.42628479003906
4368/28840	And you assisted and took part in this great battle Bragelonne cried the former musket	50.23141098022461

4372/28840	When we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the Spaniards who were on a height with lowered musk	56.21632766723633
4373/28840	When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers Comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those	70.07449340820312
4374/28840	There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword Sound trumpets he	99.45764923095703
4375/28840	Well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you Raoul   I know not sir but I thought it really very fine and grand   Were you afraid Raoul asked the	40.441184997558594
4376/28840	Yes sir replied the young man naively I felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in Spanish from the enemys ranks I closed my eyes and thought of	31.631811141967773
4377/28840	In honest truth Raoul said Athos pressing his	37.29866409301758
4378/28840	Yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had	41.93608474731445
4379/28840	Those who were not killed felt the heat of the	104.12566375732422

4381/28840	At that moment I encountered the eye of the	133.97760009765625
4382/28840	I had but one thought and that was that he was observing	42.66728591918945
4383/28840	I spurred on and found myself in the enemys	26.47464942932129
4384/28840	And the prince was pleased with you   He told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to Paris with Monsieur de Chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had	21.496461868286133
4385/28840	Go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of your	47.68842315673828
4386/28840	Go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made me of	50.03415298461914
4387/28840	And I came sir added Raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for I thought you would be glad to see me	19.806903839111328
4388/28840	Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young	31.841867446899414
4389/28840	What is his name   I did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although I thought from his accent he was an English	33.403656005859375
4390/28840	Ah said Athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could	27.527894973754883
4391/28840	Then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate	20.87249183654785
4392/28840	Yes truly dear friend and I may even say the sight of you increases my	92.8141098022461
4393/28840	And De Winter glancing around him Raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffected	29.978513717651367
4394/28840	Come now that we are alone said Athos let us talk of	25.623117446899414
4395/28840	Whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied De	77.63044738769531
4396/28840	Does Grimaud know him then   No but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew	25.686124801635742
4397/28840	The headsman of Bethune exclaimed De	22.56717300415039
4398/28840	You know about that cried Athos	113.76529693603516
4399/28840	He has just left me replied De Winter after telling me	39.24177551269531
4400/28840	De Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his	23.147233963012695
4401/28840	Do you not know the race said	52.29314422607422
4402/28840	Pooh said Athos trying to smile in his	22.821622848510742
4403/28840	It must have lost its ferocity in the second	48.899906158447266
4404/28840	Besides my friend Providence has warned us that we may be on our	49.537288665771484
4405/28840	All we can now do is to	139.0979461669922
4406/28840	Let us wait and as I said before let us speak of	110.40542602539062
4407/28840	What brings you to Paris   Affairs of importance which you shall know	82.79834747314453
4408/28840	But what is this that I hear from Her Majesty the Queen of England Monsieur dArtagnan sides with Mazarin Pardon my frankness dear	24.35135269165039
4409/28840	I neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by	84.711181640625
4410/28840	But do you happen to belong to him   Monsieur dArtagnan replied Athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional	21.438745498657227
4411/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to	24.42691421508789
4412/28840	Millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in	623.7752075195312
4413/28840	Alas said De Winter I am at this moment as poor as he is if not	29.484638214111328
4414/28840	Well then you wish to know if I am of Mazarins party	39.199642181396484
4415/28840	I am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence You make me young and happy again by	94.91053009033203
4416/28840	Ah so you are not a Mazarinist Delightful Indeed you could not belong to	29.877670288085938
4417/28840	But pardon me are you free I mean to ask if you are married   Ah as to that no replied Athos	38.17506408691406
4418/28840	Because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished   Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his	46.23555374145508
4419/28840	Very well you are always the same Athos great and	84.37279510498047
4420/28840	Are you still friends with Monsieur Porthos and Monsieur Aramis   Add Monsieur dArtagnan my	9.16505241394043
4421/28840	We still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being Mazarinists or Frondists then we are only	34.58750534057617
4422/28840	Is Monsieur Aramis with DArtagnan asked Lord de	16.527597427368164
4423/28840	No said Athos Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my	23.158876419067383
4424/28840	Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend Is he much changed   He has become an abbé that is	33.86806869506836
4425/28840	You alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undert	74.35130310058594
4426/28840	On the contrary said Athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable	23.19582176208496
4427/28840	Could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the Pont du Louvre   Oh oh exclaimed Athos smiling you have a duel in	21.564897537231445
4428/28840	Yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which I hope you will take your	72.21397399902344
4429/28840	Where are we to go my lord   To Her Majesty the Queen of England who has desired me to present you to	17.09212875366211
4430/28840	This is an enigma said Athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it I ask no	36.614070892333984
4431/28840	Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me   Thanks count no replied De	34.80900955200195
4432/28840	I own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my	85.00433349609375
4433/28840	What undertaking can have brought him to Paris It was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my	63.45330810546875
4434/28840	This young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predis	40.29679489135742
4435/28840	What occupies him in England   He is one of Cromwells most enthusiastic	39.71139144897461
4436/28840	But what attached him to the cause His father and mother were Catholics I believe   His hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of De	39.989749908447266
4437/28840	And what name does he now bear   Mord	70.76473236083984
4438/28840	A Puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in	137.62110900878906
4439/28840	Do you say as a monk   It was thus and by mere accidentmay God pardon me if I blasphemethat he heard the confession of the executioner of Beth	26.921682357788086
4440/28840	Then I understand it all he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forest	30.674118041992188
4441/28840	But the night is dark said Athos perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no	48.06502151489258
4442/28840	I have Tony a safe if simple	501.0415954589844
4443/28840	Halloo there Grimaud Olivain and Blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with	55.184078216552734
4444/28840	Blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne whom Athos had christened by the name of his	29.49782943725586
4445/28840	Viscount said Athos to Raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach	41.944061279296875
4446/28840	Oh count said De Winter for whom do you take me   For a stranger who does not know Paris said Athos and to whom the viscount will show the	30.37038803100586
4447/28840	De Winter shook him by the	44.0494270324707
4448/28840	Grimaud said Athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the	61.618324279785156
4449/28840	Grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloqu	91.92607116699219
4450/28840	The same order was followed in returning nor did Grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the Qu	48.73984146118164
4451/28840	He fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his	47.85762023925781
4452/28840	He pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue	86.68213653564453
4453/28840	The next day on awaking the count perceived Raoul by his bed	49.2508544921875
4454/28840	The young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by	67.22027587890625
4455/28840	Yes sir replied Raoul with slight hesitation I did not sleep	29.315401077270508
4456/28840	You Raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said Ath	55.22711944580078
4457/28840	Where then said Athos smiling if it be not a	29.068763732910156
4458/28840	You are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting	62.50343322753906
4459/28840	Never sir said Raoul as long as I possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to	38.967525482177734
4460/28840	I have however a wish to go and pass a day at Bl	38.46586227416992
4461/28840	You look at me and you are going to laugh at	21.685089111328125
4462/28840	No on the contrary I am not inclined to laugh said Athos suppressing a	25.937280654907227
4463/28840	You wish to see Blois again it is but	62.56996154785156
4464/28840	Then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed Raoul joy	54.01640701293945
4465/28840	Certainly and why should I regret what gives you pleasure   Oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and I can set out immediately   When you like Ra	31.61927032470703
4466/28840	Sir said Raoul as he turned to leave the room I have thought of one thing and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my introduction to the	18.703054428100586
4467/28840	And you ought to thank her Ra	114.60160064697266
4468/28840	Well try the Hotel de Luynes Raoul and ask if the duchess can receive	41.360687255859375
4469/28840	I am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the	33.897029876708984
4470/28840	Raoul went out and when Athos heard his young joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain he	43.78618621826172
4471/28840	It is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common	97.33404541015625
4472/28840	Nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not	568.5550537109375
4473/28840	Everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as Athos was watching Raoul mount a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevre	30.82080078125
4474/28840	He was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her	25.112627029418945
4475/28840	Tell her grace replied Athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Lu	39.358646392822266
4476/28840	Then with renewed instructions to Grimaud Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that	33.425621032714844
4477/28840	Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois the only servingman whom he had	31.983318328857422
4478/28840	Blaisois found Bazin donning his beadles gown his services being required that day at Notre	82.34488677978516
4479/28840	Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis	41.285396575927734
4480/28840	Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and Christian	48.11898422241211
4481/28840	From the Comte de la Fere said Aram	6.033224582672119
4482/28840	And he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much	35.803897857666016
4483/28840	Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his	32.16412353515625
4484/28840	And you did not tell him that you came from me   No	15.355755805969238
4485/28840	At ten oclock Athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de	32.52125930786133
4486/28840	They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was not coming to join	51.912208557128906
4487/28840	Patience said Athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the Rue du Bac patience I see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be Aram	20.1668701171875
4488/28840	Having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him Aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten p	41.36730194091797
4489/28840	At this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious	44.75067138671875
4490/28840	A most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and Lord de	68.10812377929688
4491/28840	Where are we going inquired Aramis are we going to fight perchance I carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to procure	92.44965362548828
4492/28840	No said Lord de Winter we are going to pay a visit to Her Majesty the Queen of	8.919424057006836
4493/28840	Oh very well replied Aramis then bending his face down to Athoss ear what is the object of this visit continued	45.69800567626953
4494/28840	Nay I know not some evidence required from us	361.5243225097656
4495/28840	May it not be about that cursed affair asked Aramis in which case I do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them	63.13243103027344
4496/28840	If it were so answered Athos we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter for he would come in for his share he was one of	35.55967330932617
4497/28840	On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the	43.579532623291016
4498/28840	It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by Athos Aramis and even the English	47.213050842285156
4499/28840	Mazarin is almost king answered Athos Madame Henrietta is almost no longer	189.97544860839844
4500/28840	If you would condescend to be clever Athos observed Aramis I really do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur de Vo	48.17205047607422
4501/28840	The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Mis	33.666046142578125
4502/28840	The gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated	97.67461395263672
4503/28840	Athos was calm and grave but Aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented	62.06329345703125
4504/28840	You are examining the luxury I enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around	59.056217193603516
4505/28840	Madame replied Aramis I must ask your pardon but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry	29.31352996826172
4506/28840	is treated at the court of	78.4782943725586
4507/28840	Monsieur Aramis is not an officer asked the queen of Lord de	19.779708862304688
4508/28840	That gentleman is the Abbé dHerblay replied	22.424463272094727
4509/28840	Madame he said I am an abbé it is true but I am so against my	25.683265686035156
4510/28840	I never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and I am always ready to become a musketeer once	42.82843017578125
4511/28840	This morning being ignorant that I should have the honor of seeing your majesty I encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majestys service in whatever way you may see fit to use	37.949005126953125
4512/28840	The Abbé dHerblay resumed De Winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis	17.786741256713867
4513/28840	of whom I have spoken to you mad	14.953096389770508
4514/28840	Then turning to Athos he continued And this gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere whose high reputation is so well known to your	21.94717788696289
4515/28840	Gentlemen said the queen a few years ago I had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my	135.1156768798828
4516/28840	It is enough said Athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours mad	65.51022338867188
4517/28840	I am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of	75.96724700927734
4518/28840	Hold gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by Lord de	52.24175262451172
4519/28840	Obeying the queen Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded	68.86792755126953
4520/28840	Well asked Athos when he had closed the	32.37138748168945
4521/28840	Well said the queen it has been	37.57047653198242
4522/28840	The two friends exchanged a smile of	53.123165130615234
4523/28840	And now said Athos what is to be done I have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire Monsieur dHerblay and myself to do in your	15.33080768585205
4524/28840	Ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said Did I not answer for them   But you sir said the queen to Aram	20.968856811523438
4525/28840	Well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for	41.72413635253906
4526/28840	The king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the Scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a Scotch	76.8067398071289
4527/28840	Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted sir	93.68257904052734
4528/28840	I ask much too much perhaps for I have no title to request	68.56212615966797
4529/28840	Go to England join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every	69.78929138183594
4530/28840	And in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen I promisenot to reward you I believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every	72.63751220703125
4531/28840	And the queen raised her eyes solemnly	43.20905685424805
4532/28840	Madame said Athos when must we set out   You consent then exclaimed the queen joy	30.53740119934082
4533/28840	Yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our	41.80561065673828
4534/28840	We render service to God madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so	228.41656494140625
4535/28840	Madame we are yours body and	527.1311645507812
4536/28840	Oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or	79.98260498046875
4537/28840	Have you anything to ask of me From this moment I become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in	51.14452362060547
4538/28840	Madame replied Athos I have only to ask your majestys	12.996079444885254
4539/28840	And I said Aramis I am alone in the world and have only your majesty to	24.1471004486084
4540/28840	The queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to De Winter   If you need money my lord separate the jewels I have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some	45.50672912597656
4541/28840	You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like	53.971839904785156
4542/28840	The queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the Princess Henri	97.3094482421875
4543/28840	She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they	41.927757263183594
4544/28840	At the foot of the staircase De Winter	55.770233154296875
4545/28840	Not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and I will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the Gate Saint	43.47259521484375
4546/28840	We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the	42.35709762573242
4547/28840	Once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the	60.026329040527344
4548/28840	The three gentlemen then shook hands Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore and Athos and Aramis remaining	27.961172103881836
4549/28840	Well said Aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count   Bad replied Athos very	24.18802261352539
4550/28840	As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear DHerbl	40.258018493652344
4551/28840	Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy cannot survive without the countenance of monarch	87.94953918457031
4552/28840	Let us then support monarchy in order to support	144.22698974609375
4553/28840	We shall be murdered there said Aram	43.317359924316406
4554/28840	I hate the Englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills	152.70037841796875
4555/28840	Would it be better to remain here said Athos and take a turn in the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort Ifaith Aramis believe me there is little left to	41.68484115600586
4556/28840	We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is	321.1899719238281
4557/28840	And you   As for me I am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers I shall not find ten louis at	31.475732803344727
4558/28840	Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income	88.89329528808594
4559/28840	Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be	53.182559967041016
4560/28840	Now it is that I regret DArtagn	20.79764175415039
4561/28840	This secret Aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our	74.03618621826172
4562/28840	And moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of	152.10977172851562
4563/28840	Let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of	178.9747772216797
4564/28840	You are right but what are you going to do until this evening I have two things to	29.17116355895996
4565/28840	And what are they   First a thrust with the coadjutor whom I met last night at Madame de Rambouillets and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting	64.34149169921875
4566/28840	This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our	59.46827697753906
4567/28840	I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of	54.06691360473633
4568/28840	And I my dear Aramis quietly replied Athos I think it would only change Monsieur de Retzs	35.15932846069336
4569/28840	Take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of	67.12488555908203
4570/28840	So if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first   Oh that is of the first	55.93490219116211
4571/28840	Unfortunately it is a thing that I cant perform at any time I	64.40309143066406
4572/28840	It was arranged for the evening and no other time will	99.12906646728516
4573/28840	But my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return   Yes if I	44.584632873535156
4574/28840	If you do not return how does it concern you Be	57.05384063720703
4575/28840	Come you are no longer twenty years	19.587188720703125
4576/28840	To my great regret mordieu Ah if I were but twenty years old   Yes said Athos doubtless you would commit great follies But now we must	47.368900299072266
4577/28840	I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to	85.5616226196289
4578/28840	Call for me at eight oclock or shall I wait supper for you at seven   That will do very well said Aram	34.7102165222168
4579/28840	I have twenty visits to make and as many letters to	65.1434555053711
4580/28840	Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome left his name at Madame de Chevreuses and wrote the following letter to DArtagnan   Dear FriendI am about to set off with Aramis on important	27.88949203491211
4581/28840	I wished to make my adieux to you but time does not	53.29536819458008

4584/28840	Bythebye he said I think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for Porthos and DArtagn	29.81486701965332
4585/28840	The thing is done dear friend said Athos I foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and	53.94963455200195
4586/28840	You are a wonderful man my dear count said Aramis you think of	31.323379516601562
4587/28840	Well have you made up your mind to this journey   Quite and now that I reflect about it I am glad to leave Paris at this	28.790374755859375
4588/28840	And so am I replied Athos my only regret is not having seen DArtagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our	38.25535202026367
4589/28840	Sir said he here is Monsieur dArtagnans	11.695056915283203
4590/28840	But I did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said Ath	40.99142837524414
4591/28840	And I set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden j	65.92335510253906
4592/28840	Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms   My dear CountWhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of	64.30986022949219
4593/28840	Now recalling former times of mutual distress I send you half my purse it is money to obtain which I made Mazarin	147.8260955810547
4594/28840	Dont make a bad use of it I entreat	26.67925262451172

4609/28840	The two friends mounted as did their	199.737060546875
4610/28840	At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin who was running breath	44.82829284667969
4611/28840	Oh sir exclaimed he thank Heaven I have arrived in	113.85978698730469
4612/28840	Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you	39.222347259521484

4615/28840	You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier I will break every bone in your	23.792375564575195
4616/28840	How can you read asked Athos it is as dark as a cold	58.89080810546875
4617/28840	Wait said Bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted waxlight with which he started the church	71.13516235351562
4618/28840	Here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity	56.326927185058594
4619/28840	Do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if I want money I can send for some to any of my chateaux at Bracieux alone I have twenty thousand francs in	54.71339797973633
4620/28840	So if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a larger	32.01614761352539
4621/28840	I address you because you know that although I esteem him from my heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere but it is understood that what I offer you I offer him at the same	25.662588119506836

4623/28840	The division being made by the light of Bazins taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De Winter at the Porte Saint	32.05208206176758
4624/28840	In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the	72.48104858398438
4625/28840	The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their	24.9880428314209
4626/28840	It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the	117.83341217041016
4627/28840	At last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent	73.05660247802734
4628/28840	Boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then	179.03640747070312
4629/28840	Gentlemen said De Winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at Parislet us separate to avoid	141.6540985107422
4630/28840	I know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to	49.09247970581055
4631/28840	I will go there where I expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to LEpee du Grand Henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us	48.01138687133789
4632/28840	The matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern	106.591064453125
4633/28840	Their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any	73.79833984375
4634/28840	It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to Grim	52.241092681884766
4635/28840	Athos and Aramis walked down toward the	25.209712982177734
4636/28840	From their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promen	50.62416076660156
4637/28840	There was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided	117.56575775146484
4638/28840	This man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jet	54.347198486328125
4639/28840	From the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to	27.11794090270996
4640/28840	On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to	61.124900817871094
4641/28840	That is doubtless our boat said Ath	77.03028869628906
4642/28840	Yes replied Aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only De Winter does not keep us	75.35651397705078
4643/28840	It is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman	67.82710266113281
4644/28840	In truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of De Winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so	68.23074340820312
4645/28840	Gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but I see you come from Paris or at least that you are strangers at Boulog	62.72682189941406
4646/28840	He is and he is not replied Athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of France but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long	41.211795806884766
4647/28840	However sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison   No sir not at this moment at	30.076875686645508
4648/28840	Sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man	84.17171478271484
4649/28840	What do you think of that interrogator asked Aram	19.942766189575195
4650/28840	I think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of	64.95765686035156
4651/28840	And you replied to him with that notion   Nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and I was so to	58.18642044067383
4652/28840	But if he be a spy   What do you think a spy would be about here We are not living in the time of Cardinal Richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare	40.502689361572266
4653/28840	It matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued Aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the	61.9158821105957
4654/28840	And you said Athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winters	26.567567825317383
4655/28840	Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped   More reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his	61.63486862182617
4656/28840	And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel   I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching	55.908660888671875
4657/28840	Besides let me own something to	225.56561279296875
4658/28840	I am anxious to see that young man	41.188690185546875
4659/28840	In ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a	120.13065338134766
4660/28840	Ah Egad cried Aramis you set me	74.3529281616211
4661/28840	I swear to you I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my	55.70676040649414
4662/28840	Ah here is De Winter coming said Ath	36.144020080566406
4663/28840	Good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us	50.84621047973633
4664/28840	I see them about twenty paces behind my	59.28009033203125
4665/28840	I recognize Grimaud by his long legs and his determined sl	125.53156280517578
4666/28840	Then we set sail tonight asked Aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be	54.96686553955078
4667/28840	Diable resumed Aramis I have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel I confess I prefer the convent of No	64.76873779296875
4668/28840	Athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward De	31.659780502319336
4669/28840	What ails our friend said Aramis he resembles one of Dantes damned whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their	67.5357437133789
4670/28840	What the devil makes him glower thus behind him   When De Winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapid	48.32692337036133
4671/28840	What is the matter my lord said Athos and what puts you out of breath thus   Nothing replied De Winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned	33.49051284790039
4672/28840	But let us go continued De Winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchordo you see it there I wish I were on board already and he looked back	59.41615295410156
4673/28840	He has seen him said Athos in a low tone to Aram	8.644937515258789
4674/28840	They had reached the ladder which led to the	59.92369079589844
4675/28840	De Winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow	60.908199310302734
4676/28840	At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embark	23.977888107299805
4677/28840	He fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned	22.975923538208008
4678/28840	Athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young	40.55194854736328
4679/28840	The latter to make a short cut had appeared on a slu	153.16058349609375
4680/28840	He certainly bodes us no good said Athos but let us embark once out at sea let him	85.02622985839844
4681/28840	And Athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart row	44.36558532714844
4682/28840	But the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the	51.37842559814453
4683/28840	She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted	43.60927963256836
4684/28840	They saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it	43.268733978271484
4685/28840	Ay but said Aramis that young fellow is decidedly a	78.83185577392578
4686/28840	Which is the young man asked De Winter turning	44.242431640625
4687/28840	He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold   De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramiss	67.753662109375
4688/28840	The beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed	47.05374526977539
4689/28840	It is he exclaimed De Winter seizing the arm of Athos it is he I thought I recognized him and I was not	22.525224685668945
4690/28840	The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from	57.57888412475586
4691/28840	Yes it is I my uncleI the son of MiladyI the monkI the secretary and friend of CromwellI know you now both you and your	73.90434265136719
4692/28840	In that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their	202.29002380371094
4693/28840	As for Grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his	35.25239181518555
4694/28840	Ah exclaimed Aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of Milady as he says	29.436059951782227
4695/28840	Then wait said Aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from Tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the	60.660587310791016
4696/28840	Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be	34.10865783691406
4697/28840	I had him so well at the point of my gun I should have sent a ball into his	36.896629333496094
4698/28840	It is enough to have killed the mother said Athos hoarse	40.048851013183594
4699/28840	The mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to	99.04358673095703
4700/28840	Yes but the son has done us no	50.004695892333984
4701/28840	Grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his	74.52579498291016
4702/28840	The young man burst into a	43.1348876953125
4703/28840	Ah it is certainly you he	170.6139373779297
4704/28840	His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the	97.99024963378906
4705/28840	Be calm exclaimed Athos for Heavens sake have we ceased to be men   No said Aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear	41.904911041259766
4706/28840	De Winter only replied by a gro	61.50498580932617
4707/28840	It was all up with him continued Aramis ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal	157.517333984375
4708/28840	Athos took Lord de Winters hand and tried to turn the	43.03274154663086
4709/28840	When shall we land in England he asked but De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no	62.26705551147461
4710/28840	Hold Athos said Aramis perhaps there is yet	38.60564422607422
4711/28840	See if he is still in the same	20.9875545501709
4712/28840	Athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aure	61.27042770385742
4713/28840	Decidedly Aramis said Athos I think I was wrong not to let you	47.212059020996094
4714/28840	Hold your tongue replied Aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were	32.1558952331543
4715/28840	At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were	61.20600891113281
4716/28840	The captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards Hastings where they were to	71.62870025634766
4717/28840	At this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness	63.32022476196289
4718/28840	Then a voice reached them once more sending this threat To our next meeting sirs in	285.03668212890625
4719/28840	Te Deum for the Victory of	96.33116912841797
4720/28840	Such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with	284.657470703125
4721/28840	The motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope of beating the	54.01085662841797
4722/28840	Now since the affair of Nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling Mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete	67.43804168701172
4723/28840	A council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided	79.43548583984375
4724/28840	It was only known that on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor of the victory of	42.48632049560547
4725/28840	The following Sunday then the Parisians arose with joy at that period a Te Deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great	53.348655700683594
4726/28840	The shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his	55.82480239868164
4727/28840	Moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te De	146.308349609375
4728/28840	The police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous	77.55522918701172
4729/28840	Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from Baz	52.51454162597656
4730/28840	In consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door and knocked	83.86447143554688
4731/28840	His mother the councillors old servant opened	313.69830322265625
4732/28840	And what hast thou to say boy to Monsieur Broussel   I wish to tell him replied Friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this	39.106727600097656
4733/28840	And as I hear everywhere that at the court they are illdisposed to him I wish to warn him that he may be on his	41.46891403198242
4734/28840	Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the	46.97768020629883
4735/28840	On the contrary my boy on the contrary I am pleased with your	32.01095199584961
4736/28840	Dame Nanette look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new	66.4720230102539
4737/28840	Oh thank you sir thank you Monsieur Broussel said Friquet I am so fond of apricots   Broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine o	18.63957405090332
4738/28840	The councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around Notre	46.51291275024414
4739/28840	This noise redoubled when DArtagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the	24.836891174316406
4740/28840	He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and Porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as DArtagnan had so often done	34.10756301879883
4741/28840	The sergeant of this company a veteran of the Spanish wars had recognized Porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Tré	46.738189697265625
4742/28840	Porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great	37.72834396362305
4743/28840	At last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded char	77.70285034179688
4744/28840	Ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the	70.5270767211914
4745/28840	God save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were	71.28878021240234
4746/28840	Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of Comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe now entirely	24.675275802612305
4747/28840	When it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix as if he was waiting for some	47.20127487182617
4748/28840	All the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been	46.66605758666992
4749/28840	Friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of Notre	66.76264953613281
4750/28840	Thence he saw the king the queen and Monsieur Mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on	31.476354598999023
4751/28840	Friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his	80.00416564941406
4752/28840	Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussels	31.56754493713379
4753/28840	Comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and Friquet was waiting behind Comminges until the door should be	27.316125869750977
4754/28840	What dost thou there rascal asked Comm	42.149845123291016
4755/28840	I want to go into Master Broussels house captain replied Friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of Paris know so well how to assume when	46.877742767333984
4756/28840	And on what floor does he live asked Comm	55.26310348510742
4757/28840	In the whole house said Friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is	45.824161529541016
4758/28840	At this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at	30.069913864135742
4759/28840	The worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to	63.90876007080078
4760/28840	At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed	75.0654067993164
4761/28840	Still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain	27.30921745300293
4762/28840	Sir said Comminges I am the bearer of an order from the	24.759794235229492
4763/28840	Very well sir replied Broussel what is this order And he held out his	35.14490509033203
4764/28840	I am commissioned to seize your person sir said Comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow	35.504764556884766
4765/28840	A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling	77.8320083618164
4766/28840	It was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the	42.12615203857422
4767/28840	Madame Broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their fathers	29.00026512145996
4768/28840	Come sir said Comminges make haste you must obey the	26.05194091796875

4772/28840	Impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the	58.382667541503906
4773/28840	Comminges turned and saw Dame Nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her	30.500961303710938
4774/28840	My good Nanette be quiet I beseech you said Brous	61.08414077758789

4782/28840	The two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented	32.53495407104492
4783/28840	Dont you see them cried Friquet dont you see there they are   The coachman turning around gave Friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with	29.012693405151367
4784/28840	Ah devils coachman cried Friquet youre meddling too Wait   And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands	53.44870376586914
4785/28840	The tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the	75.72157287597656
4786/28840	The soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the car	69.9069595336914

4790/28840	The first who advances is a dead man cried Raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling	75.65199279785156
4791/28840	Comminges so to speak threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in after	84.18270874023438
4792/28840	At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the	26.945255279541016
4793/28840	Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second	35.94728088378906
4794/28840	Very well sir said Comminges you shall hear of this an	141.99839782714844

4796/28840	Friquet and Nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening	61.25237274169922
4797/28840	Down with the officer down with him was the	215.28897094726562
4798/28840	One step nearer said Comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoners breast one step nearer and I kill the prisoner my orders were to carry him off alive or	61.08518600463867

4803/28840	But this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the	152.8042449951172
4804/28840	From time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibr	45.80633544921875
4805/28840	Voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of	326.615966796875
4806/28840	Cries of Death death to the guards to the Seine with the officer were heard above all the noise deafening as it	70.95164489746094

4813/28840	Raoul was about to reply when DArtagnan bent down to his	24.12604331970215
4814/28840	Hold your tongue said he and let me	60.33306121826172

4816/28840	Hold theres a carriage coming over y	136.42250061035156

4818/28840	I will go said Comminges and if they come back fire   Not at allnot at all replied DArtagnan let no one	22.51546287536621
4819/28840	On the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly	105.6943130493164
4820/28840	Comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had	49.0416374206543
4821/28840	But when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the	44.41179656982422

4824/28840	As the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the Quai and overflowed the Pont Neuf and adjacent	22.284494400024414
4825/28840	A few shots were fired and one musketeer was	64.17963409423828

4827/28840	One man alone remained in his place gun in	281.36431884765625
4828/28840	Ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated Wait an	84.7421646118164

4830/28840	DArtagnan bent down to his horses neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the	37.13968276977539
4831/28840	The horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the	46.66764831542969
4832/28840	DArtagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked	41.975406646728516
4833/28840	Oh sir exclaimed Raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the Rue Cocatrix spare him it is his son   DArtagnans arm dropped to his	18.29503631591797

4837/28840	If I take you you will be hung   The young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horses head disappeared at the corner of the Rue Gueneg	29.378541946411133
4838/28840	Ifaith said DArtagnan to Raoul you were just in time to stay my	39.55311584472656
4839/28840	He was a dead man and on my honor if I had discovered that it was his son I should have regretted having killed	27.04619026184082

4844/28840	The musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom DArtagnan had given to Comminges	14.429447174072266
4845/28840	Halloo cried DArtagnan has something fresh happened   Eh sir replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time it really must be	66.38567352294922
4846/28840	They are bad managers said DArtagnan shrugging his	7.634714603424072
4847/28840	When a carriage is chosen it ought to be	124.73094940185547
4848/28840	The carriage in which a Broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand	30.557641983032227
4849/28840	What are your commands lieutenant   Take the detachment and conduct him to his	63.44655990600586
4850/28840	But you will be left alone  	22.918603897094727
4851/28840	So you suppose I have need of an escort	137.1171875
4852/28840	The musketeers set off and DArtagnan was left alone with Ra	10.606599807739258
4853/28840	Now he said are you in pain   Yes my head is not only swimming but	47.31114959716797
4854/28840	Whats the matter with this head said DArtagnan raising the battered	42.465946197509766
4855/28840	Yes I think I received a flowerpot upon my	45.032188415527344
4856/28840	But were you not on horseback you have sp	76.14055633544922
4857/28840	Yes but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was taken	22.315582275390625
4858/28840	At this very moment Friquet passed mounted on Raouls horse waving his particolored cap and crying Broussel Broussel   Halloo stop rascal cried DArtagn	29.109487533569336
4859/28840	Friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his	66.28701782226562
4860/28840	DArtagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue Master Friquet but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking	26.029464721679688
4861/28840	Friquet had a quick eye and a fine	250.62820434570312
4862/28840	He saw DArtagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at	25.29183578491211
4863/28840	Ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward DArtagnan and I am truly pleased to meet	31.84178352355957
4864/28840	DArtagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little chorister of the Rue de la Cal	13.414153099060059
4865/28840	Ah tis thou rascal said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy thou hast become a horse stealer   Ah your honor how can you say so exclaimed Fri	74.194091796875

4869/28840	Ten kicks on his back said DArtagnan be off you little villain and forget not that I have your	84.04598236083984
4870/28840	Friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine and	46.183631896972656
4871/28840	Raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiqueton	19.241596221923828
4872/28840	DArtagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own	22.72742462158203
4873/28840	They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chev	26.85515785217285
4874/28840	The handsome Madeleine announced to DArtagnan that Planchet had returned bringing Mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would	26.49785614013672
4875/28840	DArtagnan desired Planchet to be summoned but he had	16.207536697387695
4876/28840	You are much pleased with yourself said he to Raoul when they were alone are you not   Well yes replied Ra	29.404470443725586
4877/28840	It seems to me I did my	49.44325637817383
4878/28840	And who told you to defend the king   The Comte de la Fere	12.719926834106445
4879/28840	Yes the king but today you have not fought for the king you have fought for Mazarin which is not quite the same	30.106584548950195
4880/28840	But you yourself   Oh for me that is another	52.27281188964844
4881/28840	As for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no	122.85674285888672
4882/28840	But has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel Breathe not a word of that or the Comte de la Fere will be	35.36973190307617
4883/28840	You think the count will be angry with me   Think it Im certain of it were it not for that I should thank you for you have worked for	41.8718147277832
4884/28840	However I scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe	126.21808624267578
4885/28840	And moreover my dear child continued DArtagnan I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your	29.025920867919922
4886/28840	I do not understand you sir said Ra	9.963443756103516
4887/28840	DArtagnan rose and taking a letter from his writingdesk presented it to Ra	25.719640731811523
4888/28840	The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the	38.81576919555664
4889/28840	Oh mon Dieu he said raising his fine eyes to DArtagnan moist with tears the count has left Paris without seeing me   He left four days ago said DArtagn	20.793174743652344
4890/28840	But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps	100.94076538085938
4891/28840	Heheincur danger of death No be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere	160.57545471191406

4893/28840	Well sir I will obey you although I do not understand	27.157899856567383
4894/28840	It is unnecessary for you to	49.16447830200195
4895/28840	Hold continued DArtagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is Monsieur du Vallon who comes with his coat	22.816204071044922
4896/28840	Yes but in exchange said Porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange I have torn many	58.298091888427734
4897/28840	Those wretches wanted to take away my sword Deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but I knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of Balizard	73.67230224609375
4898/28840	Oh Ill answer for you said the Gascon filling Porthoss glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your	46.36075210571289
4899/28840	Look here resumed DArtagnan here is Monsieur de Bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comm	17.10098648071289
4900/28840	Will you come said he to Porth	29.999557495117188
4901/28840	Where asked Porthos filling a second glass of	34.835208892822266
4902/28840	To present our respects to the	125.18283081054688
4903/28840	Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed DArtagn	33.86751174926758
4904/28840	As for Raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by DArtagnan to leave the room until the tumult was	24.376422882080078
4905/28840	They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely DArtagnan his captaincy Porthos his bar	39.32742691040039
4906/28840	DArtagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to	56.87028121948242
4907/28840	But though he held the cardinals promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage Porth	90.25920104980469
4908/28840	Whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for	105.51570129394531
4909/28840	Mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow	89.39142608642578
4910/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his	14.58513355255127
4911/28840	Those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of	97.85040283203125
4912/28840	The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the Spaniard it had just gained another over the	50.08456802368164
4913/28840	Comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when DArtagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door behind the	25.197124481201172
4914/28840	Ah madame said Comminges hastening to DArtagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my	26.84480857849121
4915/28840	Without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint Cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the	61.386962890625
4916/28840	DArtagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to	16.4686222076416
4917/28840	I know that sir I have known that said the queen a long time therefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my	45.7257080078125
4918/28840	Permit me madame said DArtagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of Tréville he has done	42.429439544677734
4919/28840	In the regiment said DArtagnan he is called Porthos the queen started but his true name is the Chevalier du Vall	19.050067901611328
4920/28840	These names are too numerous for me to remember them all and I will content myself with the first said the queen gr	42.256874084472656
4921/28840	At this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assembl	18.622562408447266
4922/28840	The fact was in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the	29.073402404785156
4923/28840	Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping	45.90106201171875
4924/28840	Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like Mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely	74.31387329101562
4925/28840	He therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill	75.27828979492188
4926/28840	The coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at	59.525360107421875
4927/28840	His speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their	102.21393585205078
4928/28840	He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys	98.27310943603516
4929/28840	Immediately the wits of the court plunged into	310.8782653808594
4930/28840	NogentBeautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a	44.760860443115234
4931/28840	This caused a universal burst of	116.96762084960938
4932/28840	The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as Henry	23.144287109375
4933/28840	had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Iv	35.84646224975586

4935/28840	The queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to	39.42051696777344

4939/28840	Then turning toward Porthos The devil said he this has a bad	77.86422729492188
4940/28840	I dislike these quarrels among men of the	130.95286560058594
4941/28840	Gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his	54.48659896850586
4942/28840	Oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court I will teach you how to laugh tomorrowbut in another	66.84830474853516
4943/28840	On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was Louvie	26.442886352539062
4944/28840	Broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings	83.79331970214844
4945/28840	The only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a	28.10327911376953
4946/28840	The coadjutor went to him and held out his	11.665430068969727
4947/28840	The young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his	15.017044067382812
4948/28840	My dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor believe me I am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to	14.969793319702148
4949/28840	Is that true and do you speak seriously asked Louvie	70.88641357421875
4950/28840	From the depth of my heart said Gond	24.945005416870117
4951/28840	In that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be	56.21994400024414
4952/28840	Oh let us speak frankly continued Louvieres and act in a straightforward	51.64280700683594
4953/28840	Thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure Christian charity that would be too	72.71704864501953
4954/28840	You are ambitiousit is natural you are a man of genius and you know your	42.75921630859375
4955/28840	As for me I hate the court and have but one desire at this momentvenge	82.84858703613281
4956/28840	It was now the coadjutors turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvie	36.04081344604492
4957/28840	But Monsieur Louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me   You have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you	24.046405792236328
4958/28840	Never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires	19.632164001464844
4959/28840	And how many hours of reflection do you ask   Twelve hours sir is it too long   It is now noon at midnight I will be at your	42.04468536376953
4960/28840	If I should not be in wait for	35.1273307800293
4961/28840	When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his	53.99583053588867
4962/28840	Two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Paris had assembled	108.03472900390625
4963/28840	Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meillera	19.563325881958008
4964/28840	The curates asked him what was to be	39.732337951660156

4966/28840	For the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound I will listen to him with the greatest	117.2012710571289
4967/28840	You think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said Gond	44.488590240478516
4968/28840	My lord I have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to	45.32404708862305
4969/28840	Who and what is this man   A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his	23.542438507080078
4970/28840	What is his name   He is named Planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he	38.00668716430664
4971/28840	And can you find him   I hope	21.88027572631836
4972/28840	I think he has not been arrested and as I am his wifes confessor if she knows where he is I shall know it	34.39799880981445
4973/28840	Very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to	56.565399169921875
4974/28840	We will be with you at six oclock my	23.899805068969727
4975/28840	Go my dear curate and may God assist you   And you sir continued Gondy turning to the curate of	20.557960510253906
4976/28840	I my lord said the latter I know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of	35.347511291503906
4977/28840	Him I can place at your disposal it is Count de Roche	76.62091064453125
4978/28840	I know him also but unfortunately he is not in	28.192190170288086
4979/28840	My lord he has been for three days at the Rue Cass	65.63456726074219
4980/28840	And wherefore has he not been to see me   He was toldmy lord will pardon me   Certainly	50.50719451904297
4981/28840	That your lordship was about to treat with the	54.782630920410156
4982/28840	Diable think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you   I offer you a beggar my	59.555904388427734
4983/28840	Bravo and the man   A plain and simple beggar as I have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of	59.09706115722656
4984/28840	Well the man whom I offer you is a general synd	43.99988555908203
4985/28840	And what do you know of him   Nothing my lord except that he is tormented with	20.53165626525879
4986/28840	What makes you think so   On the twentyeighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday I said this mass	86.35535430908203
4987/28840	And his name   Maillard but I do not think it is his right	27.672712326049805
4988/28840	And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post  	42.04949951171875
4989/28840	Let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true	46.89830017089844
4990/28840	Gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the cur	36.31938552856445
4991/28840	The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the	22.00122833251953
4992/28840	Eustache Church watching carefully to ascertain the popular	170.43569946289062
4993/28840	The people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle	54.947288513183594
4994/28840	On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the	62.711334228515625
4995/28840	Stop he said there he is at his	42.11003494262695
4996/28840	Gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his	34.171382904052734
4997/28840	Is it by permission that he remains there asked Gond	214.01242065429688
4998/28840	No my lord these places are	205.61793518066406
4999/28840	I believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for	36.67582321166992
5000/28840	The rascal is rich then   Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twentyfive and thirty thousand francs and sometimes	33.88880920410156
5001/28840	Hum said Gondy laughing I was not aware my alms were so well	43.433372497558594
5002/28840	In the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his	38.99261474609375
5003/28840	He was a man between sixtysix and sixtyeight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light	36.289913177490234
5004/28840	His countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principlesa wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by	115.73126220703125
5005/28840	He started on seeing the cavalier with the cur	34.60929489135742
5006/28840	The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the	20.73054313659668
5007/28840	Maillard began the curate this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a	80.45647430419922
5008/28840	With me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy	20.17982292175293
5009/28840	There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadj	46.16260528564453
5010/28840	Yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the	75.58683013916016
5011/28840	These are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the	303.52679443359375
5012/28840	As to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means	104.86994171142578
5013/28840	Explain yourself my good friend said the coadj	50.889617919921875
5014/28840	I mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide	72.52880096435547
5015/28840	The war will not only be approved of but directed by the	101.0516357421875
5016/28840	As for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of Paris who has the very greatest power at the court of Rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to	32.67791748046875
5017/28840	Consider Maillard said the curate that I have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that I have made myself responsible for	29.053735733032227
5018/28840	I know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore I in my turn will be serviceable to	16.309940338134766
5019/28840	Ah ah said Gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades   I will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend	45.92033767700195
5020/28840	Ifaith exclaimed Gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le curé can answer for you   I answer for him said the cur	25.480375289916992
5021/28840	Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening at ten o	33.13457107543945
5022/28840	It must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of	96.00215148925781
5023/28840	Shall I give you a line for the vicar of	43.144161224365234
5024/28840	Jacques de la Boucherie he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the cur	56.00690841674805
5025/28840	Then said the coadjutor this evening at ten oclock and if I am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your	17.094728469848633
5026/28840	The eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his	42.951324462890625
5027/28840	This evening sir he replied all will be	129.0377655029297
5028/28840	At a quarter to six oclock Monsieur de Gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal	14.953842163085938
5029/28840	At six oclock the curate of	33.51795196533203
5030/28840	The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another	24.8449764251709
5031/28840	The curate then entered followed by Planc	26.58323860168457
5032/28840	Your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to	18.720073699951172
5033/28840	Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine	35.99637222290039
5034/28840	And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked Gond	23.783742904663086
5035/28840	I am a Frondist from my	17.33195686340332
5036/28840	You see in me such as I am a person sentenced to be	79.57567596435547
5037/28840	And on what account   I rescued from the hands of Mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile where he had been for five	29.015724182128906
5038/28840	Will you name him   Oh you know him well my lordit is Count de Roche	44.892887115478516
5039/28840	Ah really yes said the coadjutor I have heard this affair	40.99060821533203
5040/28840	You raised the whole district so they told me   Very nearly replied Planchet with a selfsatisfied	45.42747116088867
5041/28840	And your business is   That of a confectioner in the Rue des Lomb	17.147991180419922
5042/28840	Explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike incl	170.4602508544922
5043/28840	Well my lord before I became a confectioner I myself was three years sergeant in the Piedmontese regiment and before I became sergeant I was for eighteen months the servant of Monsieur dArtagn	34.241233825683594
5044/28840	But he is said to be a furious Mazarin	41.503868103027344
5045/28840	You are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you   You may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the	38.06711959838867
5046/28840	How many men think you you could collect together tonight   Two hundred muskets and five hundred halber	49.15265655517578
5047/28840	Let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by tomorrow we shall have quite a powerful	70.77837371826172
5048/28840	Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort   I would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as I believe him entirely capable of the	59.822139739990234
5049/28840	Bravo   By what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes   Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his	80.29458618164062
5050/28840	Do you want money   Money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more	110.73606872558594
5051/28840	Gondy went to a box and drew forth a	53.86705780029297
5052/28840	Here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum	57.8187141418457
5053/28840	I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said Planchet putting the bag under his	28.442476272583008
5054/28840	That is right I recommend the cardinal to your	160.2511444091797
5055/28840	Make your mind easy he is in good	54.0362548828125
5056/28840	Planchet went out the curate remaining for a	18.743833541870117
5057/28840	Are you satisfied my lord he	75.4972152709961
5058/28840	Yes he appears to be a resolute	47.97565460205078
5059/28840	Well he will do more than he has	33.90287399291992
5060/28840	The curate rejoined Planchet who was waiting for him on the	16.021732330322266
5061/28840	Ten minutes later the curate of	34.07587814331055
5062/28840	As soon as the door of Gondys study was opened a man rushed	81.53216552734375
5063/28840	Tis you then my dear count cried Gondy offering his	21.522794723510742
5064/28840	You have made up your mind at last my lord said Roche	41.46052169799805
5065/28840	It has been made up a long time said Gond	18.387380599975586
5066/28840	Let us say no more on the subject you tell me so I believe	48.22627639770508
5067/28840	Well we are going to give a ball to Maz	16.846227645874023
5068/28840	And when will the dance begin   The invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow	43.27248001098633
5069/28840	You may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier dHumieres has promised me whenever I need	47.975502014160156
5070/28840	Upon fifty soldiers   Yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over I shall replace	58.189945220947266
5071/28840	Good my dear Rochefort but that is not	20.79745864868164
5072/28840	What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort   He is in Vendome where he will wait until I write to him to return to	16.876615524291992
5073/28840	You are sure of your enterprise   Yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of Paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead	53.44673538208008
5074/28840	If he defers he will find the place of honor	173.1658172607422
5075/28840	Shall I send word to him as coming from you   Yes	50.32942199707031
5076/28840	Shall I tell him that he can count on you   To the	38.53694152832031
5077/28840	And you will leave the command to him   Of the war yes but in politics   You must know it is not his	39.23423767089844
5078/28840	He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own	54.787750244140625
5079/28840	You care about it then so much   Since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said Gondy I wish at least that the hat should be	62.76443099975586
5080/28840	One must not dispute matters of taste and colors said Rochefort	180.06723022460938
5081/28840	How soon can he be here   In five	91.5894775390625
5082/28840	Let him come and he will find a change I will answer for	32.27180862426758

5085/28840	Ah Monsieur Mazarin Monsieur Mazarin said Rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether I am too old to be a man of	20.74253273010254
5086/28840	It was halfpast nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of	14.12713623046875
5087/28840	He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the	39.98108673095703
5088/28840	Good said he our syndic is at his	79.42329406738281

5091/28840	Come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle	32.31608200073242
5092/28840	He rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock	23.159605026245117

5095/28840	You are not boasting   Do you wish for a proof  	15.104400634765625
5096/28840	There were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the Palais Royal and a third upon the Rue Saint	51.79808044433594
5097/28840	The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the	60.51120376586914

5104/28840	For twenty years I have tasted nothing but	163.11083984375
5105/28840	The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold	23.262046813964844
5106/28840	Ah ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good	28.280954360961914

5110/28840	His face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward	38.79328918457031
5111/28840	Singular man muttered Gondy taking his hat to go away but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the	40.53130340576172
5112/28840	His first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasp	24.86270523071289
5113/28840	Your blessing your holiness before you go I beseech you he	80.10276794433594

5115/28840	No your holiness I take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor I recognized you at the first	31.20944595336914
5116/28840	And you want my blessing he	64.84268188476562
5117/28840	The mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was	21.66868019104004
5118/28840	Now said Gondy there is a communion between	12.730302810668945

5121/28840	The crime which I have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just	53.26687240600586

5130/28840	It was about eleven oclock at	28.884437561035156
5131/28840	Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of	38.506195068359375
5132/28840	The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horse	116.77658081054688
5133/28840	Gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire	59.898380279541016
5134/28840	He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach	110.3648452758789
5135/28840	These men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had	135.80921936035156

5137/28840	By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized Planc	22.423879623413086
5138/28840	The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la Monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower	31.250411987304688
5139/28840	They were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to	161.58016967773438
5140/28840	All these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a mus	52.2071533203125
5141/28840	On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached	22.134572982788086
5142/28840	I do not know you for one of	24.80797576904297
5143/28840	Then it is because you do not know your friends my dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor raising his	11.506692886352539
5144/28840	Gondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nes	69.30756378173828
5145/28840	There he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the	29.435739517211914
5146/28840	They might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white clo	45.4053840637207
5147/28840	When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their	62.66147232055664
5148/28840	Gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but	74.94434356689453
5149/28840	The last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived Gond	66.79410552978516
5150/28840	He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his	32.023494720458984
5151/28840	Halloo Monsieur de Rochefort said Gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms   Rochefort recognized the	26.617908477783203
5152/28840	Ah it is you my lord said	28.141523361206055
5153/28840	What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth   My fifty recruits from the Chevalier dHumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white clo	44.792118072509766
5154/28840	And where are you going   To the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his	46.770015716552734
5155/28840	Very good said Gondy shaking Rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after	52.368377685546875
5156/28840	It was now one oclock in the morning and the coadjutor returned	11.520343780517578
5157/28840	He opened a window and leaned out to	71.08141326904297
5158/28840	A strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as oceans most unfathomable	91.93321990966797
5159/28840	From time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an	41.96927261352539
5160/28840	The work of revolt continued the whole night	268.5047912597656
5161/28840	The next morning on awaking Paris seemed to be startled at her own	69.60540771484375
5162/28840	Armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every	158.81674194335938
5163/28840	Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry Long live Broussel Down with Mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even	67.70512390136719
5164/28840	They had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not	45.79374313354492
5165/28840	The barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais	32.442771911621094
5166/28840	Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were	56.37919235229492
5167/28840	Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his	78.92668151855469
5168/28840	As for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasant	18.927156448364258
5169/28840	The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually	135.78817749023438
5170/28840	He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the Pont du Louvre but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred	24.146766662597656
5171/28840	The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the qu	69.40009307861328
5172/28840	But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his	31.583444595336914
5173/28840	This time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the	81.20996856689453
5174/28840	He beat a retreat toward the market but there he met Planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threatening	46.283607482910156
5175/28840	He attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of	38.05083084106445
5176/28840	The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eust	14.979354858398438
5177/28840	They were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and	86.04551696777344
5178/28840	Master Friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous	35.98225402832031
5179/28840	The marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through	87.68355560302734
5180/28840	He dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the	95.48384857177734
5181/28840	The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he	18.367433547973633
5182/28840	He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the	118.13130187988281
5183/28840	The guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of	148.5995330810547
5184/28840	Men fell around him as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Ler	68.1056900024414

5186/28840	The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet	23.322589874267578
5187/28840	Get me out of this in Heavens name he said or I shall leave my carcass here and those of all my	63.47206497192383
5188/28840	A great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been	41.43950271606445
5189/28840	Gondy raised his hand and demanded	141.4923553466797
5190/28840	My children he said this is the Marechal de la Meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the Louvre to demand of the queen in your name our Broussels	24.568418502807617
5191/28840	You pledge yourself to that marshal added Gondy turning to La Meillera	28.172592163085938
5192/28840	Morbleu cried the latter I should say that I do pledge myself to it I had no hope of getting off so	40.060882568359375
5193/28840	He gives you his word of honor said Gond	28.15932846069336
5194/28840	The marshal raised his hand in token of ass	20.52439308166504
5195/28840	Long live the coadjutor cried the	89.86620330810547
5196/28840	It was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed	59.41425323486328
5197/28840	In the meantime as we have said Mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in	63.497135162353516
5198/28840	He called for DArtagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him DArtagnan not being on	27.800161361694336
5199/28840	In about ten minutes DArtagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable Porth	13.789765357971191
5200/28840	Ah come in come in Monsieur dArtagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend	32.58192443847656
5201/28840	But what is going on in this accursed Paris   What is going on my lord nothing good replied DArtagnan shaking his	25.002723693847656
5202/28840	Down with Mazarin Ifaith the treasonable word is	140.32786560058594

5204/28840	Then my lord   Then what asked Maz	22.8172550201416

5206/28840	As for Porthoss coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in	64.46321868896484
5207/28840	Diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration I should have cried I	54.105384826660156
5208/28840	At this moment the tumult was heard	72.79618072509766
5209/28840	Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around	165.81594848632812
5210/28840	He had a great desire to go to the window but he dared	17.939870834350586
5211/28840	See what is going on Monsieur DArtagnan said	11.817526817321777
5212/28840	DArtagnan went to the window with his habitual	14.62279987335205
5213/28840	But if they fire all is lost cried DArtagn	34.876163482666016
5214/28840	The gates to hold for five minutesthe gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder Gods death dont fire screamed DArtagnan throwing open the	105.71720123291016
5215/28840	In spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible	49.98927307128906
5216/28840	The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Royal and one of them passing under DArtagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which Porthos was complacently admiring	23.056921005249023
5217/28840	But what do you advise then asked Mazarin	52.236572265625
5218/28840	Eh egad to give up Broussel as they demand What the devil do you want with a member of the parliament He is of no earthly use to	31.05853843688965
5219/28840	And you Monsieur du Vallon is that your advice What would you do   I should give up Broussel said Porth	11.439069747924805

5221/28840	I will go and discuss the matter with the	14.677176475524902
5222/28840	He stopped at the end of the corridor and said   I can count upon you gentlemen can I not   We do not give ourselves twice over said DArtagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall	28.270437240600586
5223/28840	Very well then said Mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till I come	98.08430480957031
5224/28840	And turning off he entered the drawingroom by another	50.38391876220703
5225/28840	The queen was standing in the room pale with anger her selfcontrol however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was	27.38262939453125
5226/28840	Comminges Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the	94.04582977294922
5227/28840	Then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was	71.88923645019531
5228/28840	Fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to	87.89981842041016
5229/28840	Then disguised in the clothes of the Marquis dO he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street	42.33435821533203
5230/28840	During the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to	31.5357723236084
5231/28840	Well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all   I think that matters look very gloomy mad	23.059757232666016
5232/28840	But what step would you propose to me   I could propose one to your majesty but I dare	32.706729888916016
5233/28840	You may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid	47.75123596191406
5234/28840	The chancellor reddened and stammered some	70.36137390136719
5235/28840	It is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me advicewhat is it   Madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release Brous	25.508617401123047
5236/28840	The queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was	139.2661895751953
5237/28840	Release Broussel she cried never   At this moment steps were heard in the anteroom and without any announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the	14.829041481018066
5238/28840	Ah there you are marechal cried Anne of Austria joy	35.69814682006836

5243/28840	Ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all	78.379638671875

5247/28840	Oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission   The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the mare	34.77959442138672
5248/28840	Pardon madame he said I am not a lawyer I am a mere soldier and probably therefore I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words I ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the	36.5627326965332
5249/28840	As for what you do me the honor to say I presume you mean I was afraid   The queen	29.36928367614746
5250/28840	Well then madame yes I did feel fear and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I cannot count how many charges and skirmishes I own for the third time in my life I was	56.733795166015625
5251/28840	Yes and I would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know not whence unless from deepest	222.10157775878906
5252/28840	Bravo said DArtagnan in a whisper to Porthos well	40.071170806884766
5253/28840	Well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people   That Broussel shall be given up to them mad	21.00617218017578
5254/28840	Never said the queen never   Your majesty is mistress said La Meilleraie retreating a few	32.76177215576172
5255/28840	Where are you going marechal asked the	30.71640968322754
5256/28840	To give your majestys reply to those who await	37.6574821472168
5257/28840	Stay marechal I will not appear to parley with	72.73965454101562
5258/28840	Madame I have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to	30.73122215270996
5259/28840	Anne of Austrias eyes shot glances of	284.1932373046875
5260/28840	Oh that is no impediment sir said she I have had greater men than you arrestedGuitant   Mazarin sprang	62.68830871582031
5261/28840	Madame said he if I dared in my turn advise   Would it be to give up Broussel sir If so you can spare yourself the	40.74872970581055
5262/28840	No said Mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any	71.00505065917969
5263/28840	Then what may it be   To call for monsieur le coadjute	10.23276424407959
5264/28840	The coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker It is he who has raised all this	44.64091110229492
5265/28840	The more reason said Mazarin if he has raised it he can put it	70.92032623291016
5266/28840	And hold madame suggested Comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the Palais	59.197410583496094
5267/28840	It is true she said the arch hypocritesee   I see said Mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst I were I in his place though I am cardinal should be torn to	55.43708419799805
5268/28840	I persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadj	50.26182556152344
5269/28840	And wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low	36.98255920410156
5270/28840	Monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to	10.930720329284668
5271/28840	And what shall I say to the people   That they must have patience said Anne as I	35.22793197631836
5272/28840	The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went	42.61357879638672
5273/28840	We shall soon see said Porthos in his tranquil	42.063751220703125
5274/28840	In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by DArtagnan and Porth	15.895139694213867
5275/28840	Ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadj	11.239290237426758
5276/28840	There madame he said is Monsieur Gondy who hastens to obey your majestys	15.904897689819336
5277/28840	The queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protr	35.06573486328125
5278/28840	Well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot   That it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a	26.553390502929688
5279/28840	The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried Anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the	54.945613861083984
5280/28840	Revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to	91.38557434082031
5281/28840	Is it true asked Gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion   Yes said the queen it is	31.877790451049805
5282/28840	Your majesty wishes then   You to say what you would do in her place Mazarin hastened to	79.25077819824219
5283/28840	The coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the	21.00898551940918
5284/28840	Were I in her majestys place said Gondy coldly I should not hesitate I should release Brous	28.0279483795166
5285/28840	And if I do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the	43.53422546386719
5286/28840	I believe that not a stone in Paris will remain unturned put in the mare	64.60181427001953
5287/28840	It was not your opinion that I asked said the queen sharply without even turning	79.3999252319336
5288/28840	If it is I whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner I reply that I hold monsieur le marechals opinion in every	49.88433837890625
5289/28840	The color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with	63.831336975097656
5290/28840	Mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was	201.14828491210938
5291/28840	Give up Broussel she cried fine counsel	163.09481811523438
5292/28840	Upon my word one can easily see it comes from a	90.3136215209961
5293/28840	Gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by	79.54805755615234
5294/28840	He looked coldly at the queen who nudged Mazarin to make him say something in his	34.941349029541016
5295/28840	Mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying	1020.68408203125
5296/28840	Ho ho said he good advice advice of a	455.533203125
5297/28840	I too would give up that good Monsieur Broussel dead or alive and all would be at an	26.663049697875977
5298/28840	If you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you	146.96324157714844
5299/28840	Did I say dead or alive replied Maz	40.93451690673828
5300/28840	It was only a way of	70.45413970947266
5301/28840	You know I am not familiar with the French language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so	28.426511764526367
5302/28840	This is a council of state DArtagnan remarked to Porthos but we held better ones at La Rochelle with Athos and Aram	25.189777374267578
5303/28840	At the Saint Gervais bastion said Porth	38.35783386230469
5304/28840	The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity   Madame if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to	34.3741455078125
5305/28840	I know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a	61.05813217163086
5306/28840	Thus then it is your opinion said Anne of Austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution   Yes madame replied the coadjutor grave	25.923282623291016
5307/28840	But if I am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all	61.87731170654297
5308/28840	It is a bad year for kings said Gondy shaking his head look at England mad	41.960086822509766
5309/28840	Yes but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France replied the	38.35494613647461
5310/28840	Who knows said Gondy such men are like thunderboltsone recognizes them only when they have	52.06398391723633
5311/28840	Every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her	24.535480499267578
5312/28840	Porthos murmured DArtagnan look well at that	22.382997512817383
5313/28840	What then   Well he is a	19.582019805908203
5314/28840	Evidently he did not understand his	59.785552978515625
5315/28840	Your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but I foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the riot	61.52674865722656
5316/28840	In that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon	28.74858856201172
5317/28840	Perhaps it will be too late said Gondy still unmoved perhaps I shall have lost all influence while by giving up Broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the	35.68828201293945
5318/28840	Have I not then that right cried the	109.19583129882812
5319/28840	If you have it use it replied Gond	77.9336166381836
5320/28840	There is a man after my own	91.16577911376953
5321/28840	Oh if he were minister and I were his DArtagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a Mazarin mordieu what fine things we would do together   Yes said Porth	31.247432708740234
5322/28840	The queen made a sign for every one except Mazarin to quit the room and Gondy bowed as if to leave with the	31.814767837524414
5323/28840	Good thought Gondy she is going to	62.17819595336914
5324/28840	She is going to have him killed said DArtagnan to Porthos but at all events it shall not be by	16.714168548583984
5325/28840	I swear to Heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him I will fall upon	32.182220458984375
5326/28840	Good muttered Mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something	32.09245681762695
5327/28840	The queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned	68.62911224365234
5328/28840	It was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and	41.49830627441406
5329/28840	And now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjute	20.20240020751953
5330/28840	It is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release Broussel from prison and give him back to the	46.9089469909668
5331/28840	The coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the	50.93559646606445
5332/28840	At the first words of this address DArtagnan had seized Porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing	37.636837005615234
5333/28840	When Mazarin ceased speaking he said to Porthos in a low tone   Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish or I am a lost man and you are	23.646224975585938
5334/28840	The queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said   Pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what I	59.91762924194336
5335/28840	A woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex I am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed I am excited at the first	74.1639175415039
5336/28840	Madame replied Gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as	49.15718078613281
5337/28840	Your majesty has none but submissive and respectful	205.4835662841797
5338/28840	It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for Broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your	41.793739318847656
5339/28840	Ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought Gond	55.06437683105469
5340/28840	And what will he promise us said DArtagn	24.338977813720703
5341/28840	Peste if he is giving away hats like that Porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment	79.35772705078125
5342/28840	Corbleu let the civil war last but one year and I will have a constables sword gilt for	179.83203125
5343/28840	For you I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just	16.974435806274414
5344/28840	And so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public	36.98936080932617
5345/28840	Seriously said Gondy astonished at not having further advanced I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful	96.9900894165039
5346/28840	And I said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose	54.31397247314453
5347/28840	Gondy looked at Mazarin astonished and Mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the Palais	15.675687789916992
5348/28840	Gondy smiled the queens color rose and Mazarin grew even pal	167.08004760742188
5349/28840	At this moment Comminges rushed into the	32.40431213378906
5350/28840	Pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands   Listen madame said Gond	32.928138732910156
5351/28840	The moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that	77.51248931884766
5352/28840	What are my commands said the	41.152587890625
5353/28840	How many men have you about the Palais Royal   Six	35.201194763183594
5354/28840	Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for	115.6936264038086
5355/28840	Madame cried Mazarin what are you about   Go said the	13.087154388427734
5356/28840	Comminges went out with a soldiers passive	112.23312377929688
5357/28840	At this moment a monstrous battering was	27.966224670410156
5358/28840	One of the gates began to	75.63150024414062
5359/28840	Oh madame cried Mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and	62.7437858581543
5360/28840	At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal Anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comm	95.38086700439453
5361/28840	It is too late said Mazarin tearing his hair too late   The gale had given	33.45866775512695
5362/28840	Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited	319.3550720214844
5363/28840	DArtagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to Porthos to follow his	8.443262100219727
5364/28840	Save the queen cried Mazarin to the coadj	20.348896026611328
5365/28840	Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized Louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand	17.921178817749023
5366/28840	Not a step further he shouted the queen is signing   What are you saying asked the	39.60421371459961
5367/28840	The truth madame said Mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then he added Sign Anne I implore youI command	73.09667205810547
5368/28840	The queen fell into a chair took the pen and	44.018699645996094
5369/28840	The people kept back by Louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people	106.69261169433594
5370/28840	The queen had written The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty and she had signed	43.58935546875
5371/28840	The coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his	45.11653137207031
5372/28840	And now that you have obtained what you want go said she Monsieur de Gond	28.292400360107422
5373/28840	Whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows I am at her	31.2675838470459
5374/28840	Ah cursed priest cried Anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day I will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me	86.27439880371094
5375/28840	Leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the	26.70725440979004
5376/28840	It is you who are not a woman muttered Maz	30.433792114257812
5377/28840	Then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left DArtagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard	22.325271606445312
5378/28840	He knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed	30.161842346191406
5379/28840	At the queens last word DArtagnan had dragged Porthos into the	26.51752281188965
5380/28840	Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and	24.75387954711914
5381/28840	Why did you leave the closet Monsieur dArtagnan asked the	11.602137565612793
5382/28840	Because replied DArtagnan the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the	30.961536407470703
5383/28840	And you have been here since   About a quarter of an hour said DArtagnan motioning to Porthos not to contradict	10.065641403198242
5384/28840	Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that DArtagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his	66.49532318115234
5385/28840	Decidedly Monsieur dArtagnan you are the man I have been	29.96946907043457
5386/28840	You may reckon upon me and so may your	109.09990692138672
5387/28840	Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though by	41.6512451171875
5388/28840	Anne of Austria returned to her oratory	162.6148223876953
5389/28840	a prisoner at Vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a Brousselgood God what then is to become of royalty   The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting	68.02812194824219
5390/28840	The people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for Broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending	28.60055160522461
5391/28840	During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror starred in every	28.886199951171875
5392/28840	Ah he said it is sad I know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our	52.2210807800293
5393/28840	What matters it about Brousselit is a name not a	88.47114562988281
5394/28840	Mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken Broussel was a thing not a	256.666748046875
5395/28840	The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of	64.59620666503906
5396/28840	The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three	162.3938446044922
5397/28840	By his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barric	103.61461639404297

5516/28840	It was one of the Gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough	53.91044616699219

5559/28840	DArtagnan obeyed and Mazarin ascertained that the seal was	18.352195739746094
5560/28840	I shall want you this evening he said Return in two	83.83112335205078
5561/28840	My lord said DArtagnan I have an appointment in two hours which I cannot	20.91232681274414
5562/28840	Do not be uneasy said Mazarin it is the	38.20677947998047
5563/28840	Good thought DArtagnan I fancied it was	17.48320770263672
5564/28840	Return then at five oclock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with	27.93162727355957
5565/28840	Only leave him in the anteroom as I wish to speak to you	17.690893173217773
5566/28840	DArtagnan bowed and thought Both at the same hour both commands alike both at the Palais	38.671104431152344
5567/28840	Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret   You are thoughtful said Mazarin uneas	12.17619514465332
5568/28840	Yes I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or	78.10742950439453
5569/28840	Very well my lord it shall be	38.96040344238281
5570/28840	DArtagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend Mazarins flattering promises which gave Porthos an indescribable	25.146657943725586
5571/28840	When DArtagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejo	28.21347427368164
5572/28840	The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask	33.95343017578125
5573/28840	The return also of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving a grand	91.03189849853516
5574/28840	The princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her	78.4096908569336
5575/28840	Anne of Austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with grace and	143.2988739013672
5576/28840	Mazarin disappeared as they rose from	1294.8851318359375
5577/28840	He found DArtagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anter	18.63277244567871
5578/28840	The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his	19.258153915405273
5579/28840	dArtagnan said the minister sitting down I am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an	35.677955627441406
5580/28840	I hope said DArtagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of	20.773611068725586
5581/28840	More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend therefore I apply to	76.75196838378906
5582/28840	We are about to leave this evening continued Maz	34.7646369934082
5583/28840	dArtagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your	52.42698287963867
5584/28840	Explain yourself my lord I am	207.22360229492188
5585/28840	The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germ	20.26521110534668
5586/28840	Aha said DArtagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave	25.4429874420166
5587/28840	It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o	57.71544647216797
5588/28840	Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one muttered DArtagn	43.400474548339844
5589/28840	Oh women women whether queens or not they are always the	154.3558807373047
5590/28840	Do you disapprove of this journey my dear	45.528289794921875
5591/28840	I my lord said DArtagnan why should I   Because you shrug your	15.845720291137695
5592/28840	It is a way I have of speaking to	63.46084213256836
5593/28840	I neither approve nor disapprove my lord I merely await your	142.33816528320312
5594/28840	Good it is you accordingly that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germ	42.4587287902832
5595/28840	You see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving DArtagnans composure that as I have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your	33.613216400146484
5596/28840	Yes my lord and I feel the whole responsibility of such a	46.05647277832031
5597/28840	You accept however   I always	314.9598693847656
5598/28840	Do you think the thing possible   Everything is	44.478607177734375
5599/28840	Shall you be attacked on the road  	54.1981315612793
5600/28840	And what will you do in that case   I shall pass through those who attack	24.53373146057129
5601/28840	And suppose you cannot pass through them   So much the worse for them I shall pass over	22.544754028320312
5602/28840	And you will place the king and queen in safety also at Saint Germain  	32.500144958496094
5603/28840	On your life   On my	53.72105026245117
5604/28840	You are a hero my friend said Mazarin gazing at the musketeer with	32.471744537353516
5605/28840	And I asked Mazarin after a moments	29.629064559936523
5606/28840	How and you my lord   If I wish to leave   That would be much more	19.693300247192383
5607/28840	Why so   Your eminence might be	30.994892120361328
5608/28840	Even under this disguise asked Mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with	52.79484176635742
5609/28840	If your eminence is disguised it will be almost	93.05628967285156
5610/28840	Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for the Sicilian vesp	71.77766418457031
5611/28840	The streets are full of armed men continued DArtagn	40.42471694946289
5612/28840	Are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project   Mazarin	32.956153869628906
5613/28840	This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for	64.78297424316406
5614/28840	Mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn	150.1448516845703
5615/28840	And therefore added he quietly I have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that I have fixed upon you to escort	50.97162628173828
5616/28840	Shall you not go with the queen   No replied Maz	17.412805557250977
5617/28840	Then you will start after the queen   No said Mazarin	44.589481353759766
5618/28840	Ah said DArtagnan who began to	7.392679214477539
5619/28840	With the queen I double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe I might be	189.0390167236328
5620/28840	Very true said DArtagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamond which Mazarin wore on his	20.53006935119629
5621/28840	Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring	161.99607849121094
5622/28840	I wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to	43.65693664550781
5623/28840	It is but Christian charity replied DArtagnan not to lead ones neighbors into	44.741783142089844
5624/28840	It is exactly for that reason said Mazarin that I wish to start before	40.34797668457031
5625/28840	DArtagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute	52.32776641845703
5626/28840	Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the	313.05352783203125
5627/28840	You will begin therefore by taking me first out of Paris will you not my dear	63.215721130371094
5628/28840	dArtagnan   A difficult commission my lord replied DArtagnan resuming his serious	26.26567268371582
5629/28840	But said Mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and	30.958740234375
5630/28840	The king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and I must give it for	31.700712203979492
5631/28840	These two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the	103.13130950927734
5632/28840	But also said Mazarin you must understand that if I ask this service from you it is with the intention of being	44.306739807128906
5633/28840	Is it still only an intention your eminence asked DArtagn	45.07637023925781
5634/28840	Stay said Mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear DArtagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it I	41.67664337158203
5635/28840	DArtagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable	32.41489791870117
5636/28840	I valued it much said Mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless I give it to you with great	50.00026321411133
5637/28840	And I my lord said DArtagnan accept it as it is	23.733692169189453
5638/28840	Come let us speak of your little	54.29804611206055
5639/28840	You wish to leave before everybody and at what hour   At ten o	27.187149047851562
5640/28840	And the queen at what time is it her wish to start   At	44.03539276123047
5641/28840	I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for	43.70153045654297
5642/28840	Capital but how will you get me out of Paris   Oh as to that you must leave it to	22.69808006286621
5643/28840	I give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you	134.73171997070312
5644/28840	It seems to me however said Mazarin the safest	52.77568817138672
5645/28840	Yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the	31.4145565032959
5646/28840	Nevertheless   Or find some one else continued DArtagnan turning his	28.24827766418457
5647/28840	Oh muttered Mazarin I do believe he is going off with the diamond	64.59336853027344
5648/28840	dArtagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything   I will answer for	26.1543025970459
5649/28840	Well then let us goI must trust to	42.781639099121094
5650/28840	It is very fortunate said DArtagnan to	9.020898818969727
5651/28840	You will be here at halfpast	23.866214752197266
5652/28840	And I shall find your eminence ready   Certainly quite	37.772239685058594
5653/28840	Well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen   For what purpose   I wish to receive her majestys commands from her own	20.63222312927246
5654/28840	She desired me to give them to	21.566444396972656
5655/28840	You really wish to see her   It is indispensable my	40.16742706298828
5656/28840	Mazarin hesitated for one instant but DArtagnan was	127.02406311035156
5657/28840	Come then said the minister I will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our	33.85403823852539
5658/28840	What has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied DArtagn	25.60087776184082
5659/28840	I never swear my lord I say yes or no and as I am a gentleman I keep my	65.28890228271484
5660/28840	Come then I see that I must trust unreservedly to	16.4122371673584
5661/28840	Believe me my lord it will be your best	77.25839233398438
5662/28840	Come said Mazarin conducting DArtagnan into the queens oratory and desiring him to wait	27.922822952270508
5663/28840	He did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala	67.02349853515625
5664/28840	Thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of	94.01861572265625
5665/28840	It is you Monsieur DArtagnan she said smiling graciously I thank you for having insisted on seeing	21.02585220336914
5666/28840	I ought to ask your majestys pardon but I wished to receive your commands from your own	21.222496032714844
5667/28840	Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you   With	40.938804626464844
5668/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan continued the queen I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the	18.387502670288086
5669/28840	Your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and I know not what you mean said DArtagnan b	31.72354507446289
5670/28840	Go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at	70.26628875732422
5671/28840	And DArtagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet sl	22.12448501586914
5672/28840	Good thought he Mazarin has been listening to discover whether I betrayed	113.6824951171875
5673/28840	In truth that Italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest	74.9562759399414
5674/28840	DArtagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he entered the anter	16.652379989624023
5675/28840	He found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled	36.53425979614258
5676/28840	And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon are we not to enjoy his society   Certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais	14.613113403320312
5677/28840	And we start in his carriage then   Yes my	24.283090591430664
5678/28840	And with us no other escort but you two   Is it not enough One of us would	74.45287322998047
5679/28840	Really my dear Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles	13.832842826843262
5680/28840	I should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with	27.409297943115234
5681/28840	And Bernouindo I not take him with me   There is no room for him he will rejoin your em	32.02252960205078
5682/28840	Let us go said Mazarin since everything must be done as you	52.330810546875
5683/28840	My lord there is time to draw back said DArtagnan and your eminence is perfectly	20.122257232666016
5684/28840	Not at all not at all said Mazarin let us be	35.31586456298828
5685/28840	And so they descended the private stair Mazarin leaning on the arm of DArtagnan a hand the musketeer felt	33.30320358276367
5686/28840	At last after crossing the courts of the Palais Royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little	54.233821868896484
5687/28840	Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the key	67.8204116821289
5688/28840	Give it to me said DArtagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that	43.60387420654297
5689/28840	The steps were already down and the door	53.87672805786133
5690/28840	Mousqueton stood at the door and Porthos was inside the	21.617719650268555
5691/28840	Mount my lord said DArtagnan to Mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second	13.643078804016113
5692/28840	DArtagnan followed him and Mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many gro	29.345991134643555
5693/28840	The carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a	61.957733154296875
5694/28840	The cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around	16.88149642944336
5695/28840	On his left was Porthos whilst DArtagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either	30.24944305419922
5696/28840	Before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistolsone in front of Porthos and the other of DArtagn	31.1792049407959
5697/28840	About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped the	16.533428192138672
5698/28840	Mazarin replied DArtagnan bursting into a	108.8202896118164
5699/28840	But the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an impr	70.68989562988281
5700/28840	A good journey to ye they cried allowing it to	389.0312805175781
5701/28840	Hem said DArtagnan what does my lord think of that reply   Man of talent cried Maz	25.570415496826172
5702/28840	In truth said Porthos I understand but now   About the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a second	30.961322784423828
5703/28840	Who goes there inquired the captain of the	64.07848358154297
5704/28840	And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between	92.03133392333984
5705/28840	Who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst DArtagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses	36.3039436340332
5706/28840	But putting his head out of the carriage   Eh Planchet said	15.171103477478027
5707/28840	The chief approached and it was indeed Planchet DArtagnan had recognized the voice of his old	22.81252098083496
5708/28840	How sir said Planchet is it you   Eh mon Dieu yes my good friend this worthy Porthos has just received a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint	24.287826538085938
5709/28840	Porthos said DArtagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear Porthos to this good Planc	16.632204055786133
5710/28840	Planchet my friend said Porthos in a melancholy voice I am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to	25.891904830932617
5711/28840	Oh good Heaven said Planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen   I will tell you all about it replied Mousqu	17.220394134521484
5712/28840	Make way for us Planchet said DArtagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my	31.686429977416992
5713/28840	Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says In that case things look	25.01500701904297
5714/28840	Then he exclaimed turning to his men   Let them pass they are	24.192317962646484
5715/28840	The carriage resumed its course and Mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe	67.25499725341797
5716/28840	A few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of illlooking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of Saint Eust	48.951454162597656
5717/28840	Porthos placed his hand on the	15.108841896057129

5719/28840	A man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his	49.85000228881836
5720/28840	Eh rascal said DArtagnan do you not recognize his highness the princes carriage   Prince or not said the man	47.57095718383789
5721/28840	We are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall	64.66875457763672
5722/28840	What is to be done said Porth	11.462507247924805
5723/28840	Not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or I will hamstring your	43.30364990234375
5724/28840	Peste said Porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles	17.821535110473633
5725/28840	I will pay you two hundred for them said Maz	21.07448959350586
5726/28840	Yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung	87.74754333496094
5727/28840	If one of them comes to my side asked Porthos must I kill him   Yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extrem	37.037654876708984
5728/28840	Come and open then cried DArtagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the	36.875892639160156
5729/28840	And as the man approached DArtagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a	24.58401107788086
5730/28840	Without doubt he recognized DArtagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his	43.62466049194336
5731/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan he cried falling back a step it is Monsieur dArtagnan let him	10.059494972229004
5732/28840	DArtagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was	22.070531845092773
5733/28840	The noise was caused by Porthos who had just knocked down his	44.56873321533203
5734/28840	DArtagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces	22.18509864807129
5735/28840	There was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the	41.93913650512695
5736/28840	To Cours la Reine cried DArtagnan to the coachman then turning to Mazarin he said Now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to Heaven for your deliver	32.35576248168945
5737/28840	Mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a	109.37181091308594
5738/28840	Five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached Cours la Re	51.539955139160156
5739/28840	Is my lord pleased with his escort asked DArtagn	27.1711368560791
5740/28840	Enchanted monsieur said Mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the	30.62017250061035
5741/28840	It will not be so difficult replied DArtagnan springing to the	16.08924102783203
5742/28840	Monsieur du Vallon I commend his eminence to your	25.931665420532227
5743/28840	Be quite at ease said Porthos holding out his hand which DArtagnan took and shook in	25.582910537719727
5744/28840	Oh cried Porthos as if in	56.17184829711914
5745/28840	DArtagnan looked with surprise at his	16.36699676513672
5746/28840	What is the matter then he	25.413772583007812
5747/28840	I think I have sprained my wrist said Porth	26.983335494995117
5748/28840	The devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf	214.2445068359375
5749/28840	It was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours   Oh mine replied DArtagnan was not a	42.563175201416016
5750/28840	What was it then   It was an appar	24.65233039855957
5751/28840	And   I charmed it	43.584842681884766
5752/28840	Instead of returning then by the Saint Honore gate DArtagnan who had time before him walked around and reentered by the Porte Richel	27.332836151123047
5753/28840	He was struck by a sudden	125.26004028320312
5754/28840	Ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair	190.9627685546875
5755/28840	And approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his	34.19328689575195
5756/28840	This scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound	220.52769470214844
5757/28840	It is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said DArtagnan upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors	16.769287109375
5758/28840	He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachmans little	51.91187286376953
5759/28840	To the Palais Royal he called	15.71387004852295
5760/28840	The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his	48.84164810180664
5761/28840	The porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the	42.600765228271484
5762/28840	It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the	25.836885452270508
5763/28840	Pronounce one single word muttered DArtagnan and you are a dead	25.656923294067383
5764/28840	The coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously	26.242218017578125
5765/28840	Two musketeers were pacing the court to whom DArtagnan called by their	28.917505264282227
5766/28840	The musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order	41.14927291870117
5767/28840	Then turning toward the second musketeer DArtagnan said   Monsieur du Verger help me to place this man in a place of	22.58977699279785
5768/28840	The musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was	44.72847366333008
5769/28840	DArtagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered Mazarins anter	19.615550994873047
5770/28840	Bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his	143.5437774658203
5771/28840	Everything goes on capitally my dear Monsieur Bernouin but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe	21.856475830078125
5772/28840	Where then sir   Where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be	102.11266326904297
5773/28840	We have that sir replied Bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a	44.93550491333008
5774/28840	And now my good friend said DArtagnan to him I must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and	25.290634155273438
5775/28840	The coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man DArtagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the val	30.767366409301758
5776/28840	And now Monsieur du Verger he said shut yourself up with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the	21.660261154174805
5777/28840	The duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing I know but added he seriously you understand it is on the kings	84.42681121826172
5778/28840	At your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious	76.42733764648438
5779/28840	Bythebye continued DArtagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his	50.115108489990234
5780/28840	The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and DArtagnan went out followed by Bernou	23.67331314086914
5781/28840	Lead me into the queens oratory said DArtagnan announce to her I am here and put this parcel with a wellloaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private	29.803380966186523
5782/28840	Bernouin conducted DArtagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensive	22.301136016845703
5783/28840	Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais	25.331985473632812
5784/28840	As we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at Cours la Re	46.44169616699219
5785/28840	At ten oclock Anne of Austria had entered the kings	23.28156089782715
5786/28840	Monsieur had just retired and the youthful Louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him	111.78001403808594
5787/28840	Two royal pages were playing with	89.18196105957031
5788/28840	Laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to	26.02911949157715
5789/28840	The king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was	135.95526123046875

5794/28840	Laporte said Anne of Austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress	48.86140441894531
5795/28840	The king went out accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own	16.43147850036621
5796/28840	When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her	76.13478088378906
5797/28840	Madame de Motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress	51.63275146484375
5798/28840	The queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed	31.35442543029785
5799/28840	It was at this moment DArtagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutors carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladiesinwaiting drove out and the gates were shut after	19.060483932495117
5800/28840	A few minutes after twelve oclock Bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door having come by the cardinals secret	32.109012603759766
5801/28840	Anne of Austria opened the door to him	250.9296875

5811/28840	The young Louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming Laporte with questions who replied only in these words Sire it is by the queens	48.93108367919922
5812/28840	The bedclothes were thrown back exposing the kings bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be	60.02910614013672
5813/28840	It was one of the results of Mazarins niggard	19.439678192138672
5814/28840	The queen entered and DArtagnan remained at the	17.559104919433594
5815/28840	As soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet	48.030670166015625

5820/28840	The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed	28.909156799316406
5821/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan repeated Louis very well mad	26.848302841186523
5822/28840	At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were	69.95731353759766
5823/28840	Oh oh replied DArtagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in	35.22273635864258

5831/28840	The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal	89.33858489990234
5832/28840	Cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the	56.044578552246094
5833/28840	It was evident that there was clamor and sed	34.15275573730469
5834/28840	The king half dressed the queen and Laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and	43.72563552856445
5835/28840	Comminges who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal ran	23.88043975830078

5838/28840	DArtagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue some violent	28.5485897064209
5839/28840	He approached her and said in a low voice   Has your majesty still confidence in me   This voice startled	23.180713653564453

5843/28840	Comminges glanced at DArtagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring	68.5809555053711
5844/28840	DArtagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious	20.251522064208984
5845/28840	Monsieur de Comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we not It is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this	44.758182525634766

5859/28840	turned around astonished that any one should dare to address	188.3684844970703
5860/28840	But the queen pressed the childs	63.340911865234375
5861/28840	Does your majesty remember when playing in the park of Fontainebleau or in the palace courts at Versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder   Yes	42.62348556518555

5873/28840	You are right sir always right said Anne of	73.62236022949219
5874/28840	Laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the	61.525901794433594
5875/28840	The queen bent over him and kissed his	51.42575454711914
5876/28840	Yes said the king but I do not wish to be touched by any of those	19.201419830322266
5877/28840	Sire I am here said DArtagnan and I give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for	27.250640869140625
5878/28840	And now what is to be done asked the queen for I hear	29.049753189086914
5879/28840	Monsieur Laporte go to them and again recommend	45.302215576171875
5880/28840	Madame wait at the door whilst I shall be at the head of the kings bed ready to die for	36.00477600097656
5881/28840	Laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst DArtagnan glided behind the	37.17549133300781
5882/28840	Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her	37.261634826660156
5883/28840	On seeing the queen the men stopped short	181.8859100341797
5884/28840	There was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like	236.49691772460938
5885/28840	They had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the	121.95588684082031
5886/28840	The gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his	130.4846954345703
5887/28840	The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall	104.16876983642578
5888/28840	Enter gentlemen said Laporte since the queen desires you so to	61.13011932373047
5889/28840	Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tipt	31.273048400878906
5890/28840	This example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted court	65.4037857055664
5891/28840	Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and	64.39344787597656
5892/28840	DArtagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized Planc	27.003173828125
5893/28840	Sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to you	32.571231842041016
5894/28840	Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run	84.9697265625
5895/28840	No certainly replied Planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon	53.15343475341797
5896/28840	You will say then to my good and faithful Parisians continued Anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive DArtagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to	43.923728942871094
5897/28840	I shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but   But what asked Anne of	30.137157440185547
5898/28840	Will your majesty pardon me said Planchet but is it really the king who is lying there   Anne of Austria	34.480594635009766
5899/28840	If she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying	82.0810546875
5900/28840	A man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and	31.230770111083984
5901/28840	For one second DArtagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and DArtagnan recognized the coadj	22.834152221679688
5902/28840	It is certainly the king said the man rising	72.68230438232422
5903/28840	God bless his majesty   Yes repeated the leader in a whisper God bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their	87.0814208984375
5904/28840	Now said Planchet let us thank the	28.801490783691406
5905/28840	They all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had	41.991512298583984
5906/28840	Planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to	18.831111907958984
5907/28840	What is your name my friend she	42.27192687988281
5908/28840	Planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned	45.556705474853516

5910/28840	Yes thought Planchet to treat me as a	64.0926284790039
5911/28840	DArtagnan trembled lest Planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that Planchet had belonged to	24.716337203979492
5912/28840	Madame replied Planchet respectfully I am called Dulaurier at your	17.67745590209961
5913/28840	Thank you Monsieur Dulaurier said the queen and what is your business   Madame I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonna	24.86402130126953

5915/28840	Come come thought DArtagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good	27.864534378051758
5916/28840	DArtagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying Let us	30.604204177856445

5919/28840	Oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is I who promise	41.1334114074707
5920/28840	Then turning to DArtagnan she said   Sir you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever	20.855758666992188
5921/28840	Continue and say what we must do	77.35272216796875
5922/28840	Monsieur Laporte said DArtagnan finish dressing his	20.764698028564453
5923/28840	We may go then asked the	56.61138153076172

5925/28840	Go sir said the queen I will follow	15.922221183776855

5927/28840	DArtagnan took out the parcel which he had desired Bernouin to place under the	27.33963394165039
5928/28840	It may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondys coach	24.515226364135742
5929/28840	He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the	27.935523986816406
5930/28840	Sir said DArtagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coach	22.204851150512695
5931/28840	If when you arrive at Cours la Reine you find no one you must go on to Saint Germ	13.800039291381836
5932/28840	The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus	87.16646575927734
5933/28840	DArtagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind	22.39459228515625
5934/28840	The queen appeared and was followed by the king and the Duke dAnjou his	52.19084930419922
5935/28840	Monsieur the coadjutors carriage she exclaimed falling	17.501874923706055
5936/28840	Yes madame said DArtagnan but get in fearlessly for I myself will drive	41.624412536621094
5937/28840	The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her	16.506492614746094
5938/28840	How madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties   It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings	26.878931045532227
5939/28840	But will that not excite suspicion sir asked the	37.76786804199219
5940/28840	Your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer I have my answer	85.00117492675781
5941/28840	The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue Richel	25.08103370666504
5942/28840	On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his	38.14029312133789
5943/28840	DArtagnan signed to them to draw	34.46685028076172
5944/28840	Do you recognize the carriage he asked the	101.76127624511719
5945/28840	The sergeant put the lantern near the	125.0546875
5946/28840	They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he	8.845763206481934
5947/28840	Hush he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemen	114.35296630859375

5949/28840	The gate groaned on its hinges and DArtagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the	40.779422760009766
5950/28840	Mousqueton exclaimed DArtagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys	12.716666221618652
5951/28840	And driving the coadjutors carriage said the	24.606311798095703
5952/28840	Corpo di Dio Monsieur dArtagnan said Mazarin you are worth your weight in	58.414215087890625
5953/28840	How DArtagnan and Porthos earned by selling	8.860003471374512
5954/28840	Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet	35.693580627441406
5955/28840	However she offered the cardinal Laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the	68.6427001953125
5956/28840	It was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave Paris by night had been	63.92753219604492
5957/28840	Ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being	53.94072341918945
5958/28840	The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the Prince de Condé with the princess and dowager	41.906829833984375
5959/28840	Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was	28.484560012817383
5960/28840	The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbé de la Riviere and the third the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti brother and brotherinlaw of Cond	19.938608169555664
5961/28840	They all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their	24.693683624267578
5962/28840	The queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said   But where is Madame de Longueville   Ah yes where is my sister asked the	21.106233596801758
5963/28840	Madame de Longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your	19.43407440185547
5964/28840	Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his	18.382627487182617
5965/28840	What do you say of this asked the	26.80438804626465
5966/28840	I say that she is a hostage for the Parisians answered the	26.587997436523438
5967/28840	Why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his	34.557918548583984
5968/28840	Silence whispered the duke she has her	465.4106140136719
5969/28840	She will ruin us returned the	57.22609329223633

5972/28840	These two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing DArtagnan on the coachbox of the royal	35.08662796020508
5973/28840	Mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like Automedon of	55.86727523803711
5974/28840	The queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the Gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the	51.96034240722656
5975/28840	Let us be the avant guard said he to Porthos and find good quarters at Saint Germain nobody will think of us and for my part I am greatly fatig	49.80420684814453

5977/28840	Or rather we are very clever said DArtagn	27.152570724487305
5978/28840	The queens voice she is speaking said Porthos I think she wants to ride on horse	38.96847152709961
5979/28840	Oh she would like it but   But what   The cardinal wont allow	61.55389404296875

5985/28840	What an awakening for the Parisians said the queen	77.87841033935547
5986/28840	Well then let it be war Have we not on our side the conqueror of Rocroy of Nordlingen of Lens   The prince bowed	36.884605407714844
5987/28840	It was then three oclock in the	12.557714462280273
5988/28840	The queen walked first every one followed	195.60910034179688
5989/28840	About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her	161.46688842773438

5992/28840	I answered Mazarin I shall not sleep at all I have work to	39.12043762207031
5993/28840	Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to rep	57.32780456542969
5994/28840	Well for my part I shall go to bed said DArtagnan come Porth	15.528475761413574
5995/28840	Porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his	62.28519821166992
5996/28840	They walked from one end of the chateau to the other Porthos looking with wondering eyes at DArtagnan who was counting on his	20.341257095336914
5997/28840	Four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pist	85.13195037841797
5998/28840	Yes interposed Porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles   A pistole is not enough said DArtagnan tis worth a lou	11.998945236206055
5999/28840	What is worth a louis   Four hundred at a louis each make four hundred lou	23.510562896728516
6000/28840	Yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four	31.743501663208008
6001/28840	But four hundred what   Listen cried DArtagn	23.5339298248291
6002/28840	But as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friends	33.210758209228516
6003/28840	Isnt Mousqueton there   But he wears my livery my livery will be known replied Porth	43.59634780883789
6004/28840	He can turn his coat inside	184.09829711914062
6005/28840	You are always in the right my dear friend cried Porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice   DArtagnan	23.479568481445312
6006/28840	The two friends turned down the first street they came	53.45327377319336
6007/28840	Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst DArtagnan knocked at the door of a house to the	10.540318489074707
6008/28840	Sir we dont keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay	108.4264907836914
6009/28840	Where is the hay dealers   At the last large door in the	50.32977294921875
6010/28840	Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw   Yes theres the landlord of the Lamb and GrosLouis the farmer they both live in the Rue des Ursul	34.71316909790039
6011/28840	DArtagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles	23.455921173095703
6012/28840	He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same	49.84434127807617
6013/28840	Finally Farmer Louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and	175.53668212890625
6014/28840	There was no more to be had in Saint Germ	48.07054901123047
6015/28840	This foraging did not occupy more than half an	56.60911178588867
6016/28840	Mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new	44.493289947509766
6017/28840	He was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty lou	38.195369720458984
6018/28840	DArtagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans on their camp	24.656034469604492
6019/28840	Straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found   I can show you answered the Gas	79.58265686035156
6020/28840	And he conducted them to Mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis	23.601818084716797
6021/28840	At five oclock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be	18.692140579223633
6022/28840	DArtagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own	25.492136001586914
6023/28840	Mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him	16.72454071044922
6024/28840	DArtagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen lou	28.140207290649414
6025/28840	Porthos however found that he had no straw left for	46.84645080566406
6026/28840	He returned to Mousqueton but the steward had sold the last w	40.84366989135742
6027/28840	DArtagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that Porthos should share his couch with	42.6531982421875
6028/28840	He laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under	43.84366989135742

6118/28840	If that is all it is easily done said Porth	16.74468994140625

6122/28840	I did think of it but this letter has neither date nor post	35.53325271606445
6123/28840	And he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabb	34.290706634521484

6131/28840	On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis the friends found a vast concourse of	66.67261505126953
6132/28840	It was the Duc de Beaufort who was coming from the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians intoxicated with	16.326576232910156

6185/28840	Are you not going to put up at the Arms of England   Yes	23.251407623291016
6186/28840	Are you not charged with a mission from his eminence Cardinal Mazarin   Yes	22.364124298095703
6187/28840	In that case I am the man you have to do	29.767568588256836
6188/28840	Ah thought DArtagnan the man I am warned against by Ath	37.19986343383789
6189/28840	Ah thought Porthos the man Aramis wants me to str	37.1104736328125
6190/28840	They both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inqu	114.62942504882812
6191/28840	Do you doubt my word he	62.74222946166992
6192/28840	In that case I can give you	56.93871307373047
6193/28840	No sir said DArtagnan and we place ourselves at your	20.383920669555664
6194/28840	Well gentlemen resumed Mordaunt we must set out without delay today is the last day granted me by the	71.32957458496094
6195/28840	My ship is ready and had you not come I must have set off without you for General Cromwell expects my return impatient	88.29043579101562
6196/28840	So thought the lieutenant tis to General Cromwell that our dispatches are	76.90352630615234
6197/28840	Have you no letter for him asked the young	43.84474563598633
6198/28840	I have one the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till	46.52617263793945
6199/28840	DArtagnan tore open the envelope of the	15.569592475891113
6200/28840	It was directed to Monsieur Oliver Cromwell General of the Army of the English	28.722787857055664
6201/28840	Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell inquired Porth	8.442026138305664
6202/28840	Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said Porth	50.093833923339844
6203/28840	Come come gentlemen said Mordaunt impatiently let us	45.05889892578125
6204/28840	What exclaimed Porthos without supper Cannot Monsieur Cromwell wait a little   Yes but I said Mord	32.66062927246094
6205/28840	Well you said Porthos what then   I cannot	25.782299041748047
6206/28840	Oh as to you that is not my concern and I shall sup either with or without your	56.70712661743164
6207/28840	The young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained	71.90524291992188
6208/28840	Monsieur said DArtagnan you must excuse famished	14.674558639526367
6209/28840	Besides our supper cant delay you	751.1521606445312
6210/28840	We will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the	64.71807861328125
6211/28840	We will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you	32.69664764404297
6212/28840	Just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he	110.35637664794922
6213/28840	The name of your ship inquired DArtagn	28.73015785217285
6214/28840	Very well in half an hour we shall be on	26.78386878967285
6215/28840	And the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the Arms of	50.1247444152832
6216/28840	What do you say of that young man asked DArtagnan as they hurried	24.696643829345703
6217/28840	I say that he doesnt suit me at all said Porthos and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramiss	31.20923614501953
6218/28840	By no means my dear Porthos that man is a messenger of General Cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception I imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confid	58.73841094970703
6219/28840	Nevertheless said Porthos I have always noticed that Aramis gives good	28.629568099975586
6220/28840	Listen returned DArtagnan when our embassy is finished   Well   If it brings us back to France   Well   Well we shall	20.82747459411621
6221/28840	At that moment the two friends reached the hotel Arms of England where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the	42.035457611083984
6222/28840	There they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatient	35.4420166015625
6223/28840	It is singular said DArtagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known but who it was I cannot yet	57.72284698486328
6224/28840	A few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised	52.195091247558594
6225/28840	The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be	123.41365051269531
6226/28840	Porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to	69.82929992675781
6227/28840	DArtagnan overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him	34.807193756103516
6228/28840	There placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland but still on English soil the tents of a little army	87.75353240966797
6229/28840	The moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that Charles	28.574623107910156
6230/28840	had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some	95.35248565673828
6231/28840	About fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a Scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire	85.14482116699219
6232/28840	The former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first caval	68.28509521484375
6233/28840	In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting	68.45654296875
6234/28840	Well my dear friend said he in as pure French as has ever been uttered between Rouen and	90.17648315429688
6235/28840	Well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know	57.13987350463867
6236/28840	Why what is the matter   It would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin	63.30087661743164
6237/28840	We must go and find Lord	52.450462341308594
6238/28840	They both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking	38.06376266479492
6239/28840	Tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of anter	43.81308364868164
6240/28840	However you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the	69.86310577392578
6241/28840	Lord Winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy	92.42867279052734
6242/28840	The two friends approached Winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his	32.22759246826172
6243/28840	He turned around recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to	17.872953414916992
6244/28840	Have you observed said he to them what a bloodred color the moon has tonight   No replied Athos I thought it looked much the same as	71.91456604003906
6245/28840	I must own said Aramis I am like the Comte de la FereI can see nothing remarkable about	18.650537490844727
6246/28840	My lord said Athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the	87.05916595458984
6247/28840	Have you studied our Scotch troops and have you confidence in them   The Scotch inquired	108.061767578125
6248/28840	What Scotch   Ours egad exclaimed Ath	26.577463150024414
6249/28840	Those in whom the king has confidedLord Levens High	58.06607437133789
6250/28840	No said Winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens   Not the least in the world said Aramis and Athos at	45.25759506225586
6251/28840	Tell me continued Winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in France that Henry	85.93067169189453
6252/28840	the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with	45.46211242675781
6253/28840	de Bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard   Yes said Athos and the marechal has often told me so	54.45039749145508
6254/28840	Then it was so murmured Winter and the next day Henry	40.90799331665039
6255/28840	But what has this vision of Henry	80.08988952636719
6256/28840	to do with you my lord inquired Aram	20.163610458374023
6257/28840	Nothing and indeed I am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important	62.26768112182617
6258/28840	Yes my lord said Athos I wish to speak to the	9.47319507598877
6259/28840	To the king but the king is	21.917884826660156
6260/28840	I have something important to reveal to	61.25947570800781
6261/28840	Can it not be put off till tomorrow   He must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too	42.971492767333984
6262/28840	Lord Winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the	30.29252052307129
6263/28840	This corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful	149.44200134277344
6264/28840	These gentlemen are with me said	315.9892578125
6265/28840	The lackey bowed and let them	25.591535568237305
6266/28840	As he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and	84.36772918701172
6267/28840	They advanced and Athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by	57.25259780883789
6268/28840	Athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he	164.92701721191406
6269/28840	Ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you Comte de la Fere   Yes sire replied Ath	10.297167778015137
6270/28840	You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news   Alas sire answered Athos your majesty has guessed ar	41.00616455078125
6271/28840	It is bad news   Yes s	25.365497589111328
6272/28840	You never come to me without conferring	115.76885223388672
6273/28840	You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by Henrietta whatever news you bring speak	94.91667938232422
6274/28840	Sire Cromwell has arrived this night at	94.91365051269531
6275/28840	Ah exclaimed the king to fight   No sire but to buy your	29.839021682739258
6276/28840	What did you say   I said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the Scottish	25.245290756225586
6277/28840	For unpaid wages yes I know	330.2546081542969
6278/28840	For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor	240.15524291992188
6279/28840	Well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing	64.84120178222656
6280/28840	Impossible cried the king the Scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds And who is the Judas who has concluded this infamous bargain   Lord Le	49.65840148925781
6281/28840	Are you certain of it sir   I heard it with my own	29.266782760620117
6282/28840	The king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his	49.102943420410156
6283/28840	To cross the Tyne reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose who will not sell	60.25968933105469
6284/28840	And what shall I do in Scotland A war of partisans unworthy of a	107.8563232421875
6285/28840	The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you s	124.33078002929688
6286/28840	No no I have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their	57.81449508666992
6287/28840	Sire said Athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a	63.287349700927734
6288/28840	I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in London and I say to you Live sireit is the will of	30.704439163208008
6289/28840	I would confide my life to them but I should hesitate ere I trusted them with your majest	27.19883918762207
6290/28840	Well said Athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted	29.202505111694336
6291/28840	Let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us we will cross the Tyne reach Scotland and you will be	26.58214569091797

6293/28840	And yours Monsieur dHerblay   Yes s	9.644050598144531
6294/28840	Winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his	80.8482437133789
6295/28840	The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter reentered	99.83515930175781
6296/28840	Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses ready sadd	96.12688446044922
6297/28840	In that case exclaimed Athos let us not lose an instant but set	36.4273567199707
6298/28840	Sire said Aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this   Friends answered Charles sadly I have but threeone of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a weeks standing whom I shall never	47.11876678466797
6299/28840	Come gentlemen come   The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for	21.476102828979492
6300/28840	It was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very	44.87016677856445
6301/28840	The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing	43.010215759277344
6302/28840	Ah said the king I was unjust here is a creature that loves	57.55247497558594
6303/28840	You at least will be faithful to me	85.3934555053711
6304/28840	The horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the kings face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with	83.25386810302734
6305/28840	Yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my Arthur thou art a fond and faithful	91.32929229736328
6306/28840	After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to Athos Aramis and Winter said   Now gentlemen I am at your	22.836606979370117
6307/28840	But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the	28.845657348632812
6308/28840	What is that line cried Athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demitints of day	78.88284301757812
6309/28840	What is that line I did not observe it	85.26081085205078
6310/28840	It must be the fog rising from the river said the	49.93634796142578
6311/28840	Sire it is something more opaque than the	66.37225341796875
6312/28840	Indeed said Winter it appears to me like a bar of red	87.63749694824219
6313/28840	It is the enemy who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed Ath	51.805267333984375
6314/28840	Stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the Ironsides   This was the name given the cuirassiers whom Cromwell had made his body	45.77255630493164
6315/28840	Ah said the king we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betrayed me or	37.21416473388672
6316/28840	What are you going to do exclaimed Ath	15.67402458190918
6317/28840	To give them the order to charge and run down these miserable	149.94207763671875
6318/28840	And the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of Lord Le	29.937061309814453
6319/28840	Is the king wounded cried Lord	117.7013931274414
6320/28840	I see spots of blood on the	34.49416732788086
6321/28840	And he set off to follow the two	31.319557189941406
6322/28840	Go and call out your regiment said he I can foresee that we shall have need of it	40.403587341308594
6323/28840	Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode	30.344144821166992
6324/28840	It had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander he dismounted and	51.303707122802734
6325/28840	The general was there surrounded by the more prominent	89.143310546875
6326/28840	The king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilder	747.0055541992188
6327/28840	Charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding	39.00148391723633
6328/28840	Yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has	36.44191360473633
6329/28840	What is the matter sire exclaimed Lord Le	30.55651092529297
6330/28840	Of this treaty at least I have been	49.86015319824219
6331/28840	This is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for I stand here to accuse	99.08869934082031
6332/28840	Sire said Lord Leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false	44.10590362548828
6333/28840	My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and Scotland and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the clauses of the treaty	55.414119720458984
6334/28840	The Scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brow	28.439167022705078
6335/28840	Sire murmured Lord Leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our	43.26972198486328
6336/28840	I ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the	114.25005340576172
6337/28840	That cannot be sire said the ear	378.6813659667969
6338/28840	How cannot be What hinders it exclaimed the	133.33143615722656
6339/28840	Your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the English	29.87739372253418
6340/28840	And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it	102.89474487304688
6341/28840	Yes said they we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from him who for the last fiveandtwenty years has sucked the blood and gold of Scotland and	61.6368408203125
6342/28840	We have promised and we will keep our	60.31105422973633
6343/28840	And both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other	61.22954177856445
6344/28840	Aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his	20.847549438476562
6345/28840	On their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his	46.051456451416016
6346/28840	The king motioned him to accompany	45.07669448852539
6347/28840	They all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of	144.27479553222656
6348/28840	The king threw himself into an arm	28.599740982055664
6349/28840	Betrayed yes betrayed by the Scotch amongst whom I was born whom I have always loved better than the	162.7667236328125
6350/28840	Oh traitors that ye are   Sire said Athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a	40.55900573730469
6351/28840	Up sire up for you have here at least three men who will not betray	79.00929260253906
6352/28840	Ah if we had been five murmured Athos thinking of DArtagnan and Porth	13.64506721496582
6353/28840	What do you say inquired Charles	69.28076171875
6354/28840	I say sire that there is now but one way	61.1281623840332
6355/28840	Let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings	75.5960922241211
6356/28840	Whilst they pursue him the king might	634.3833618164062
6357/28840	It is good advice said Athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to	29.118484497070312
6358/28840	What do you think of this counsel Winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed	44.352317810058594
6359/28840	I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by Monsieur dHerbl	15.40947437286377
6360/28840	I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to	50.17692565917969
6361/28840	But if I accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my	97.15533447265625
6362/28840	He will have had the glory of having saved his king cried	106.3134536743164
6363/28840	It is right said Athos he has served your majesty longer than we	42.20283889770508
6364/28840	The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his	44.498477935791016
6365/28840	Wait a moment sir said he I have an order for each of you	43.08082580566406
6366/28840	He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the Order of the G	30.234458923339844
6367/28840	These cannot be for us said Ath	41.318336486816406
6368/28840	Such are for royalty and we are simple common	250.8709259033203
6369/28840	I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as	87.22471618652344
6370/28840	No no you do yourselves injustice but I am here to do you	71.47315216064453
6371/28840	Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula I make you a	59.38581466674805
6372/28840	Be brave faithful and loyal he said You are brave faithful and	96.80439758300781
6373/28840	Then turning to Aramis he said   It is now your turn monsieur le cheval	14.040788650512695
6374/28840	The same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the	45.353275299072266
6375/28840	Charles having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos embraced them	75.78999328613281
6376/28840	Sire said Winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are	129.17091369628906
6377/28840	The king looked at the three	54.838897705078125
6378/28840	Flying through an army sire said Athos in all countries in the world is called	71.70726776123047
6379/28840	Then I shall die sword in hand said	135.42799377441406
6380/28840	Monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever I am king   Sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our	34.452049255371094
6381/28840	The king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with Winter and went	98.21731567382812
6382/28840	Winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the	227.94422912597656
6383/28840	The king followed by the three friends turned his steps that	109.61934661865234
6384/28840	The Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle	64.26039123535156
6385/28840	Do you see that said the	30.31102180480957
6386/28840	Perhaps they are penitent and preparing to	71.85417175292969
6387/28840	If they are penitent said Athos let them follow	40.781246185302734
6388/28840	Well said the king what shall we do   Let us examine the enemys	12.277252197265625
6389/28840	At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of	60.89878845214844
6390/28840	The air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the	106.74472045898438
6391/28840	The regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly	90.93492889404297
6392/28840	On the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by	133.1307373046875
6393/28840	He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king	73.36408233642578
6394/28840	Does this man know your majesty personally inquired Aram	107.7038345336914
6395/28840	Then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the	137.23728942871094
6396/28840	Ah said Athos how much time we have	25.63230323791504
6397/28840	Now said the king give the word and let us	31.93500328063965
6398/28840	Will you not give it sire asked Ath	78.11845397949219
6399/28840	No I make you my lieutenantgeneral said the	50.20730972290039
6400/28840	What we are going to say does not concern your	20.32835578918457
6401/28840	The king smiling turned a few steps	167.58624267578125
6402/28840	This is what I propose to do said Ath	14.747641563415527
6403/28840	We will divide our regiments into two squad	63.58784866333008
6404/28840	You will put yourself at the head of the	23.81918716430664
6405/28840	We and his majesty will lead the	75.44931030273438
6406/28840	Once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the	69.60494232177734
6407/28840	To horse reechoed Athos everything is arranged and	143.1284942626953
6408/28840	Now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of France Montjoy and	154.41970825195312
6409/28840	Denis The war cry of England is too often in the mouths of tra	104.19783020019531
6410/28840	They mountedthe king on Winters horse and Winter on that of the king then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left at the head of the	25.654794692993164
6411/28840	The Scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these	70.13670349121094
6412/28840	Some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in	64.05547332763672
6413/28840	There said the king that consoles me they are not all tra	40.32298278808594
6414/28840	At this moment Winters voice was raised with the cry of Forward   The first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the	44.2418098449707
6415/28840	A regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward	86.7317886352539
6416/28840	Sire said Athos we foresaw this and if Lord Winters men but do their duty we are saved instead of	65.71762084960938
6417/28840	At this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses Winters voice crying out   Sword in hand   At these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like	32.49643325805664
6418/28840	Now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand   But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings	56.544315338134766
6419/28840	We are betrayed said the king in a low	28.440750122070312
6420/28840	Wait a moment said Athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their	30.882896423339844
6421/28840	Have they not heard that of their colonel But look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of Athoss	45.03707504272461
6422/28840	Ah cowards traitors screamed Lord Winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the	104.43384552001953
6423/28840	About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of Cromwells cuirass	31.62065887451172
6424/28840	Let us go and die with them said the	48.5563850402832
6425/28840	Let us go said Athos and Aram	15.941035270690918
6426/28840	All faithful hearts with me cried out	735.7088012695312
6427/28840	This voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gall	29.98843002319336
6428/28840	No quarter cried a voice in French answering to that of Winter which made them trem	104.51261138916016
6429/28840	As for Winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were pet	48.518150329589844
6430/28840	It was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the English regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in	31.202043533325195
6431/28840	Tis he murmured Winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his	31.43467903137207
6432/28840	The king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of Winter take him	92.9199447631836
6433/28840	No it is not the king exclaimed the caval	21.199012756347656
6434/28840	Lord Winter you are not the king you are my	53.71208953857422
6435/28840	Wretch exclaimed Aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go	70.3609390258789
6436/28840	At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two French	49.4880256652832
6437/28840	Athos after making sure that Lord Winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said   Come Aramis now for the honor of France and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally	39.10917282104492
6438/28840	At the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their	73.26766204833984
6439/28840	DArt exclaimed Athos whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with his	35.679996490478516
6440/28840	I am your prisoner said Aramis giving up his sword to Porth	14.095419883728027
6441/28840	Fire fire cried Mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two	47.95172119140625
6442/28840	And wherefore fire said the colonel every one has	149.74923706054688
6443/28840	It is the son of Milady said Athos to DArtagn	8.524737358093262
6444/28840	It is the monk whispered Porthos to Aram	24.13909912109375
6445/28840	And now the ranks began to	185.8358154296875
6446/28840	DArtagnan held the bridle of Athoss horse and Porthos that of Aram	7.204750061035156
6447/28840	Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the	125.0530776977539
6448/28840	This movement revealed the spot where Winters body had	69.30763244628906
6449/28840	Mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant	89.16826629638672
6450/28840	Athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet	141.1808624267578
6451/28840	We are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize	84.36454772949219
6452/28840	Then turning to the young man he exclaimed   A fine prize a fine prize friend Mordaunt we have both myself and Monsieur du Vallon taken two Knights of the Garter nothing	40.613616943359375
6453/28840	But said Mordaunt looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes these are Frenchmen I	28.829450607299805
6454/28840	Are you French sir said he to Ath	51.060455322265625
6455/28840	Very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow country	53.920265197753906
6456/28840	But the kingwhere is the king exclaimed Athos anx	26.009279251098633
6457/28840	DArtagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying   Eh the king We have secured	48.96904754638672
6458/28840	Yes said Aramis through an infamous act of	90.57048034667969
6459/28840	The king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty	194.3159637451172
6460/28840	He appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty	80.8880386352539
6461/28840	Drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from	40.64006042480469
6462/28840	Behold Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old Puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the	32.90015411376953
6463/28840	Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar said Mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is Charles the First the king the good King Charles who despoils his subjects to enrich	44.82258605957031
6464/28840	Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize	84.69503021240234
6465/28840	Nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mord	76.73341369628906
6466/28840	Bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by DArtagnan and Porth	20.291851043701172
6467/28840	The day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank God But where is my old friend Winter   The two gentlemen turned away their heads in	55.46723175048828
6468/28840	The demon had known how to wound	327.8969421386719
6469/28840	The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and	74.17697143554688
6470/28840	He saw a corpse at his	58.9677734375
6471/28840	He uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised Winters head and unfastening the Order of the Saint Esprit placed it on his own	29.89858627319336
6472/28840	Lord Winter is killed then inquired DArtagnan fixing his eyes on the	30.690811157226562
6473/28840	Yes said Athos by his own	46.275882720947266
6474/28840	Come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said DArtagn	39.5562858581543
6475/28840	Charles Stuart said the colonel of the English regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner   Colonel Tomlison said Charles kings cannot yield the man alone submits to	63.52720642089844
6476/28840	The king drew his sword and broke it on his	25.2642879486084
6477/28840	At this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was	85.36898803710938
6478/28840	The king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the	49.08805465698242
6479/28840	Now gentlemen said he conduct me where you	85.6817855834961
6480/28840	Turning back again he said I thought I saw Winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon	91.17521667480469
6481/28840	Never fear King Charles said Mordaunt the bullet pierced his	123.66860961914062
6482/28840	Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or Porthos said DArtagnan to Athos and Aramis that you recognize this man for Milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this	30.190038681030273
6483/28840	The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from Cromwell sent orders that Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby	54.20531463623047
6484/28840	At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver Crom	41.57539367675781
6485/28840	Have you been to the general said Mordaunt to DArtagnan and Porthos you know he sent for you after the	34.47669982910156
6486/28840	We want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied DArtagn	40.02674102783203
6487/28840	Do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds   Oh be assured said Mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well I promise	36.433616638183594
6488/28840	I shall take better care of them myself answered DArtagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt	52.543846130371094
6489/28840	I will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his em	21.453815460205078
6490/28840	You think of starting at once then inquired Mord	92.64793395996094
6491/28840	Our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were	43.6083984375
6492/28840	The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant   You will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town	32.85830307006836
6493/28840	The sergeant made a sign of	64.69055938720703
6494/28840	Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent	56.954002380371094
6495/28840	Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young	23.569278717041016
6496/28840	Mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw Cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being	115.41625213623047
6497/28840	Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered Cromwell did not	36.41463088989258
6498/28840	At last after a few moments Cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly	48.098636627197266
6499/28840	I said I wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young	41.45650100708008
6500/28840	They thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it I am ready to	58.900691986083984
6501/28840	Ah is it you Mordaunt said Cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may	57.89797592163086
6502/28840	To congratulate mewhat for   On the capture of Charles	101.11473083496094
6503/28840	I was much more really so two hours	133.65582275390625
6504/28840	How so general   Because England had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is	87.28912353515625
6505/28840	Have you seen him   Yes	35.170806884765625
6506/28840	What is his bearing   Mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the	31.62761116027832
6507/28840	What did he say   Some parting words to his	32.561767578125
6508/28840	Has he any friends Then he added aloud Did he make any resistance   No sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of	47.00645065307617
6509/28840	To whom did he give up his sword   He did not give it up he broke	23.44221305847168
6510/28840	He did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more	88.71836853027344
6511/28840	I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed said Cromwell staring very fixedly at Mord	77.09341430664062
6512/28840	What was his name   Lord	28.357332229614258
6513/28840	My uncle answered Mordaunt but traitors to England are no longer members of my	76.5600357055664
6514/28840	Cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy Shakespeare describes so well   Mordaunt he said you are a terrible	30.445905685424805
6515/28840	When the Lord commands said Mordaunt His commands are not to be	93.91362762451172
6516/28840	Abraham raised the knife against Isaac and Isaac was his	484.8965759277344
6517/28840	Yes said Cromwell but the Lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be	95.2233657836914
6518/28840	I have looked around me said Mordaunt and I have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the	41.40439224243164
6519/28840	You are strong among the strong Mordaunt he said and the Frenchmen how did they behave   Most fear	57.90780258178711
6520/28840	Yes yes murmured Cromwell the French fight well and if my glass was good and I mistake not they were foremost in the	65.1252212524414
6521/28840	It was the fault of their horses not	187.03175354003906
6522/28840	And the Scotch   They kept their word and never stirred said Mord	60.91490936279297
6523/28840	Wretched men   Their officers wish to see you	100.30625915527344
6524/28840	I have no time to see	13.197345733642578
6525/28840	Are they paid   Yes	152.39413452148438
6526/28840	Let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough I have nothing more to do with them nor they with	82.11691284179688
6527/28840	Before I go said Mordaunt I have some questions and a favor to ask you	54.57596206665039
6528/28840	A favor from me   Mordaunt	78.29622650146484
6529/28840	I come to you my leader my head my father and I ask you master are you contented with me   Cromwell looked at him with aston	22.10224723815918
6530/28840	Yes said Cromwell you have done since I knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave	43.700130462646484
6531/28840	Do you remember sir it was my idea the Scotch treaty for giving up the king   Yes the idea was	57.89176559448242
6532/28840	I had no such contempt for men	315.7464599609375
6533/28840	Was I not a good ambassador in France   Yes for Mazarin has granted what I	82.9374008178711
6534/28840	Have I not always fought for your glory and interests   Too ardently perhaps it is what I have just reproached you	46.29161834716797
6535/28840	But what is the meaning of all these questions   To tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these	25.140064239501953
6536/28840	Oh said Oliver with a slight curl of his lip I forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been	106.86165618896484
6537/28840	Sir I can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my	39.41835403442383
6538/28840	How is that   I have the payment under my hand I almost possess	91.23548889160156
6539/28840	What is it Have they offered you money Do you wish a step or some place in the government   Sir will you grant me my request   Let us hear what it is	48.82319641113281
6540/28840	Well then said Cromwell I promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request	60.55577087402344
6541/28840	Sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them   For their ransom have they then offered a large one inquired Crom	96.45361328125
6542/28840	On the contrary I think they are poor	60.88761520385742
6543/28840	They are friends of yours then   Yes sir exclaimed Mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and I would lay down my life for	42.468223571777344
6544/28840	Very well Mordaunt exclaimed Cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more I will give them to you I will not even ask who they are do as you like with	83.27729034423828
6545/28840	Thank you sir exclaimed Mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should I lose it I should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my	55.77579116821289
6546/28840	He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed	25.26581573486328
6547/28840	What said Cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more you wish neither gold nor rank   You have given me all you can give me and from today your debt is	61.1569709777832
6548/28840	And Mordaunt darted out of the generals tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with	28.512954711914062
6549/28840	He has slain his uncle he murm	109.73487854003906
6550/28840	Alas what are my servants Possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the	85.8432388305664
6551/28840	Charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but I have none   And with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by Mord	38.109981536865234
6552/28840	Whilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwells tent DArtagnan and Porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at	29.786983489990234
6553/28840	The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by DArtagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme	30.34811019897461
6554/28840	The prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own	65.73040771484375
6555/28840	It would be impossible to describe Mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen	30.1896915435791
6556/28840	Mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange	45.5263557434082
6557/28840	What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one	69.10523986816406
6558/28840	The house to which DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous	16.96997833251953
6559/28840	It was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of	36.82360076904297
6560/28840	The windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a	44.490966796875
6561/28840	The two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the	32.29472351074219
6562/28840	Why dont we go in with them asked Porth	40.172523498535156
6563/28840	We must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied DArtagn	36.53321838378906
6564/28840	The sergeant and his men took possession of the little	54.6900520324707
6565/28840	DArtagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that	47.02604293823242
6566/28840	We have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your	71.61097717285156
6567/28840	There could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received DArtagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to General Cromwells	35.812171936035156
6568/28840	The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his	182.04071044921875
6569/28840	Things look black enough replied Porthos I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mord	63.02021026611328
6570/28840	Silence cried the Gascon do not utter that	75.0704574584961
6571/28840	But argued Porthos I speak French and they are all	87.21149444580078
6572/28840	DArtagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass	30.125900268554688
6573/28840	But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying Let us go	34.9534797668457
6574/28840	They found Athos in profound despondency Aramis looked first at Porthos and then at DArtagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful	30.095949172973633
6575/28840	You want to know how we came here Tis easily	108.64773559570312
6576/28840	Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Crom	106.89437103271484
6577/28840	But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt whom I bade you distrust asked Ath	54.384334564208984
6578/28840	And whom I advised you to strangle Porthos said Aram	30.2581844329834
6579/28840	There is a certain fatality in	90.40660858154297
6580/28840	Yes you are right DArtagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us So my dear Aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to	36.89395523071289
6581/28840	Zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing	66.66126251220703
6582/28840	Yes added Athos I now ask you DArtagnan what side you are on Ah behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of	58.576045989990234
6583/28840	Do you know in what crime you are today engaged In the capture of a king his degradation and his	74.65177154541016
6584/28840	Oh oh cried Porthos do you think so   You are exaggerating Athos we are not so far gone as that replied the	23.38947868347168
6585/28840	Good heavens we are on the very eve of	47.52571487426758
6586/28840	I say why is the king taken prisoner Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a	71.24456787109375
6587/28840	Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that Cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling They will kill him you may be sure of	24.44698143005371
6588/28840	I dont maintain the contrary said DArtagn	12.735520362854004
6589/28840	A friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their	72.6542739868164
6590/28840	We have served them to the best of our poor means and God will recompense the will forgive the want of	81.05007934570312
6591/28840	You may see matters differently DArtagnan and think	71.50711059570312
6592/28840	I will not attempt to argue with you but I blame	26.547712326049805
6593/28840	Heyday cried DArtagnan what matters it to me after all if Cromwell whos an Englishman revolts against his king who is a Scotchman I am myself a	48.906402587890625
6594/28840	I have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible   Yes said Porth	13.551158905029297
6595/28840	Because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above	103.949951171875
6596/28840	And you you DArtagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of France bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagon	44.549442291259766
6597/28840	Ah DArtagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman I say that you are very culp	20.307777404785156
6598/28840	DArtagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of Athos he encountered those of Aram	34.23365020751953
6599/28840	Porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said   Yes yes my dear count I feel that you are	27.303617477416992
6600/28840	Come he said stretching out his hand to DArtagnan come dont be sullen my dear son for I have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a	22.21324920654297
6601/28840	It would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all	35.2318229675293
6602/28840	But here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one cant	102.56423950195312
6603/28840	Who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house France his warda charming youth for we saw him in the campto fly to the aid of a rotten wormeaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old ho	76.83439636230469
6604/28840	The sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are	214.63949584960938
6605/28840	DArtagnan I am your prisonertreat me as	74.92044067382812
6606/28840	Ah pardieu said DArtagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very	35.29072952270508
6607/28840	No said Aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the Philipgh	47.055843353271484
6608/28840	And how were they treated asked DArtagn	25.587711334228516
6609/28840	Why said Aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were	38.3019905090332
6610/28840	Well I said DArtagnan I answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor	28.02260971069336
6611/28840	Sang Diou let them come on Besidesdo you see that door Athos   Yes what then   Well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the	56.764400482177734
6612/28840	I recognize you there my brave DArtagnan replied Athos but you are no longer our	26.212892532348633
6613/28840	That door is guarded DArtagnan you know	48.12283706665039
6614/28840	Very well you will force it said Porth	40.76729965209961
6615/28840	There are only a dozen men at the	56.16145706176758
6616/28840	That would be nothing for us four it is too much for us	65.93395233154297
6617/28840	No divided as we now are we must	158.89097595214844
6618/28840	See the fatal example on the Vendomois road DArtagnan you so brave and you Porthos so valiant and so strongyou were beaten today Aramis and I are beaten in our	58.7054557800293
6619/28840	Now that never happened to us when we were four	39.45828628540039
6620/28840	Let us die then as De Winter has died as for me I will fly only on condition that we all fly	111.19963073730469
6621/28840	Impossible said DArtagnan we are under Mazarins	37.23479080200195
6622/28840	I know it and I have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as	83.71943664550781
6623/28840	Besides said Aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like DArtagnan and Porth	34.95372772216797
6624/28840	Be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our	134.7069854736328
6625/28840	As for myself I shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you Athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are	48.13634490966797
6626/28840	DArtagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his	25.425857543945312
6627/28840	At last   Do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you And wherefore should they do so What interest have they in your death Moreover you are our	63.66099548339844
6628/28840	Fool cried Aramis knowest thou not then Mordaunt I have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were	99.97401428222656
6629/28840	The truth is Im very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised me said Porth	37.32703399658203
6630/28840	Eh I make no account of the harm Mordaunt can do cried DArtagn	42.107906341552734
6631/28840	Cap de Diou if he troubles me too much I will crush him the insect Do not fly	91.89408111572266
6632/28840	It is useless for I swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years agoyou Athos in the Rue Ferou and you Aramis in the Rue de Vaugir	28.33683967590332
6633/28840	Stop cried Athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted you will soon know what to expect for here he	32.0976676940918
6634/28840	In fact looking at the place to which Athos pointed DArtagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gall	30.073518753051758
6635/28840	Stay said DArtagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the	30.072895050048828
6636/28840	When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw DArtagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their	24.263471603393555
6637/28840	Halloo he cried are the prisoners still there   Yes sir answered the sergeant uncover	35.70174789428711
6638/28840	Tis well order four men to conduct them to my	109.67293548583984
6639/28840	What is it said DArtagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his	27.34535026550293
6640/28840	What is the matter if you please   Sir replied Mordaunt I have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my	29.658706665039062
6641/28840	Wherefore sir Excuse curiosity but I wish to be enlightened on the	69.20105743408203
6642/28840	Because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and I choose to dispose of them as I	54.308807373046875
6643/28840	Allow meallow me sir said DArtagnan to observe you are in	19.520587921142578
6644/28840	The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them	55.02490234375
6645/28840	You might have taken Lord Winterwho tis said was your uncleprisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I could have killed our prisonerswe preferred taking	51.90251922607422
6646/28840	Mordaunts very lips grew white with	2057.629150390625
6647/28840	DArtagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the	87.7425765991211
6648/28840	At the first beat Porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the	22.648326873779297
6649/28840	Sir he thus addressed DArtagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron Oliver Crom	54.58112335205078
6650/28840	These words struck DArtagnan like a thunder	34.798885345458984
6651/28840	The blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his	23.8729248046875
6652/28840	As for Porthos he looked inquiringly at DArtagn	5.760392665863037
6653/28840	This look of Porthoss made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly	60.585052490234375
6654/28840	Violence he said to himself would spoil all DArtagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he	68.7938232421875
6655/28840	Why did you not say so at once my dear sir all England is with Cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners I bend sir to your	71.40352630615234
6656/28840	Mordaunt delighted advanced Porthos looking at DArtagnan with openmouthed aston	56.577510833740234
6657/28840	Then DArtagnan trod on his foot and Porthos began to understand that this was merely	18.062448501586914
6658/28840	Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow	40.15445327758789
6659/28840	But pardon said DArtagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious General Oliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in	34.2175407409668
6660/28840	He has given you some little writing for methe least bit of paper which may show that you come in his	83.24855041503906
6661/28840	Be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that I may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my country	82.41767120361328
6662/28840	Otherwise you see although I am sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad	53.04975509643555
6663/28840	Mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at DArtagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human count	106.8841323852539
6664/28840	When I tell you a thing sir said Mordaunt you insult me by doubting	52.42715835571289
6665/28840	I cried DArtagnan I doubt what you say God keep me from it my dear Monsieur Mordaunt On the contrary I take you to be a worthy and accomplished	27.52410125732422
6666/28840	And then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued DArtagnan with his frank	16.37787628173828
6667/28840	Monsieur du Vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about	27.820363998413086
6668/28840	I do not speak for him but for	34.803218841552734
6669/28840	Well sir What more   WellIIm not	152.1654052734375

6672/28840	is the king of the Spaniards never had a penny in his	32.974098205566406
6673/28840	Go on sir I see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what I think that stops you I can obviate the	64.74993896484375
6674/28840	Ah I knew well said the Gascon that you were a man of	22.20947265625
6675/28840	Well heres the case heres where the saddle hurts me as we French	172.2505645751953
6676/28840	I am an officer of fortune nothing else I have nothing but what my sword brings me inthat is to say more blows than bank	53.82557678222656
6677/28840	Now on taking prisoners this morning two Frenchmen who seemed to me of high birthin short two knights of the GarterI said to myself my fortune is	101.11959075927734
6678/28840	I say two because in such circumstances Monsieur du Vallon who is rich always gives me his	47.00979232788086
6679/28840	No replied DArtagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour I am a man of order sir let us do things in	37.88439178466797
6680/28840	Nevertheless replied Mordaunt I could compel you I command	121.43218994140625
6681/28840	Ah sir said DArtagnan I see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know	15.689522743225098
6682/28840	We are gentlemen we are both of us able to kill you and your eight menwe two	103.46349334716797
6683/28840	For Heavens sake dont be obstinate for when others are obstinate I am obstinate likewise and then I become ferocious and headstrong and theres my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than	59.350345611572266
6684/28840	Ask him then for the written	209.84083557128906
6685/28840	What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt   Yes the written order said Porthos who now began to comprehend what DArtagnan was aiming at we ask only for	23.96721839904785
6686/28840	However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons DArtagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the	46.930782318115234
6687/28840	He decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the	71.62596893310547
6688/28840	He therefore mounted his horse and	58.35416030883789
6689/28840	Good thought DArtagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we	17.146411895751953
6690/28840	Go to the stable you will find Mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my	35.747230529785156
6691/28840	Porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his	41.952293395996094
6692/28840	I go he said only shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are   No it is not worth	41.05205535888672
6693/28840	Well do me the kindness to take my purse which I left on the mantel	23.704336166381836
6694/28840	He then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great	42.53645324707031
6695/28840	At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with	22.439556121826172
6696/28840	DArtagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos went	25.918813705444336
6697/28840	My dear Athos I have reflected on your arguments and I am	33.843875885009766
6698/28840	I am sorry to have had anything to do with this	19.517208099365234

6702/28840	Well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he	106.22832489013672

6706/28840	That will be the signal when I call outJesus Seigneur   But give us your word that you will come too DArtagnan said Ath	24.019119262695312
6707/28840	Tis settled said Aramis at the cry Jesus Seigneur we go out upset all that stands in our way run to our horses jump into our saddles spur them is that all  	37.068214416503906
6708/28840	See Aramis as I have told you DArtagnan is first amongst us all said Ath	18.446943283081055
6709/28840	Very true replied the Gascon but I always run away from	70.15547180175781
6710/28840	Dont forget the signal Jesus Seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the selfsame	31.485376358032227
6711/28840	The soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm On the rivers of	108.02597045898438
6712/28840	My dear friend General Cromwell has sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch	20.061904907226562
6713/28840	Guard the prisoners well I beg of	56.8841667175293
6714/28840	The sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand French and DArtagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and	26.855121612548828
6715/28840	Then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the	48.280670166015625
6716/28840	Each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to Porthos and Mousqueton turn to the left so that Athos and Aramis may see you clearly from the	20.980918884277344
6717/28840	You didnt forget my purse   No be	140.63406372070312
6718/28840	Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their	27.071298599243164
6719/28840	Then DArtagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the	20.496280670166016
6720/28840	There caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his	72.87200164794922
6721/28840	It was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been	43.3309211730957
6722/28840	The soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran	82.90821838378906
6723/28840	Help help cried DArtagnan stopmy horse has the stag	50.18915939331055
6724/28840	In an instant the horses eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with	97.11444091796875
6725/28840	What will you let me be killed Jesus Seigneur   No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed	16.716941833496094
6726/28840	The coast owing to the Gascons stratagem was	66.35206604003906
6727/28840	The prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the	139.51907348632812
6728/28840	Stop stop cried DArtagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several	35.48589324951172
6729/28840	Stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their	128.36361694335938
6730/28840	But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest	41.01298141479492
6731/28840	In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois who were coming to find their	21.312728881835938
6732/28840	With one wave of his hand Athos made Grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind DArtagnan still directing them from behind with his	54.83296203613281
6733/28840	They passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open	69.27643585205078
6734/28840	All this time the soldiers were calling out Stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of	34.20528030395508
6735/28840	Whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen	115.88019561767578
6736/28840	It was Mordaunt with the order in his	43.10418701171875
6737/28840	The prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his	53.06167221069336
6738/28840	The sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty	45.55323791503906
6739/28840	Mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone	129.62942504882812
6740/28840	Noble Natures never lose Courage nor good Stomachs their Appet	383.28765869140625
6741/28840	The little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be	72.54249572753906
6742/28840	At last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its	53.718963623046875
6743/28840	As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council	73.41168212890625
6744/28840	The two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and Grimaud was posted as sent	45.91116714477539
6745/28840	Come first of all said Athos to DArtagnan my friend that I may shake hands with youyou our rescueryou the true hero of us	45.624107360839844
6746/28840	Athos is rightyou have my adoration said Aramis in his turn pressing his	39.38193130493164
6747/28840	The two friends recalled by DArtagnan to what was also due to Porthos pressed his hand in their	22.381534576416016
6748/28840	And now said Athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our	49.33280944824219
6749/28840	What shall we do   What are we going to do ifaith It is not very difficult to	12.992504119873047
6750/28840	We are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to	61.05670928955078
6751/28840	As for me I will give my last sou for	29.31202507019043
6752/28840	Life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a	86.71984100341797
6753/28840	What do you say to this Du Vallon   I said Porthos I am entirely of DArtagnans opinion this is a beastly country this	26.814905166625977
6754/28840	You are quite decided then to leave it asked Athos of DArtagn	28.66987419128418
6755/28840	Egad I dont see what is to keep me	56.620208740234375
6756/28840	A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aram	24.34888458251953
6757/28840	Go then my friends said the former sigh	88.10262298583984
6758/28840	Let us go you mean   No my friend said Athos you must leave	25.623435974121094
6759/28840	Leave you cried DArtagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected	13.699125289916992
6760/28840	Bah said Porthos why separate since we are all together   Because you can and ought to return to France your mission is accomplished but ours is	39.99562454223633
6761/28840	Your mission is not accomplished exclaimed DArtagnan looking in astonishment at Ath	35.660945892333984
6762/28840	Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his	17.104557037353516
6763/28840	DArtagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with mad	32.03852844238281
6764/28840	You cannot be speaking seriously Athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to	53.95880889892578
6765/28840	This army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcherit matters littleColonel	64.37763977050781
6766/28840	His majesty I can assure you will be tried on his arrival in London I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to	62.22455596923828
6767/28840	A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aram	44.981285095214844
6768/28840	And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued DArtagn	39.14888000488281
6769/28840	And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked Ath	33.71574401855469
6770/28840	The penalty of death I greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill	42.7509880065918
6771/28840	Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned   What did he say asked Porth	21.07668113708496
6772/28840	Princes must be knocked on the	217.19871520996094
6773/28840	And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king   On the contrary I am certain he will do	38.742897033691406
6774/28840	But then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so	61.30084991455078
6775/28840	No my friend Athos gently replied but De Winter sought us out in France and introduced us Monsieur dHerblay and myself to Madame Henri	41.0914306640625
6776/28840	Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her	115.32785034179688
6777/28840	We engaged our word our word included	855.3609008789062
6778/28840	It was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we	286.0038757324219
6779/28840	It remains now for us to keep our	59.973201751708984
6780/28840	Is that your opinion DHerblay   Yes said Aramis we have	28.271785736083984
6781/28840	Then continued Athos we have another reason it is thislisten In France at this moment everything is poor and palt	62.24138259887695
6782/28840	I have served them without enthusiasmGod knows that I estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteembut on	60.06612777709961
6783/28840	Today I am engaged in a different	54.79310607910156
6784/28840	I have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a European misfortune I attach myself to	160.40203857421875
6785/28840	If we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be	39.869834899902344
6786/28840	So you know beforehand you must perish said DArtagn	19.109203338623047
6787/28840	We fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of	108.57720184326172
6788/28840	What will you do in a foreign land an enemys country   I traveled in England when I was young I speak English like an Englishman and Aramis too knows something of the	59.729103088378906
6789/28840	In Heavens name my dear Athos do not make a useless	49.15069580078125
6790/28840	When I see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak I seem to have to do with a mad	46.024227142333984
6791/28840	Come Porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business   Nothing good replied Porth	22.202579498291016
6792/28840	Come continued DArtagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my	27.25710105895996
6793/28840	Well then believe me Athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to France with	53.476078033447266
6794/28840	Friend said Athos our resolution is irrevoc	35.91241455078125
6795/28840	Only reflect my good fellow said Athos it is but dying rather	88.72013854980469
6796/28840	Pooh a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling	70.73234558105469
6797/28840	If I am astonished at anything remarked Porthos sententiously it is that it has not already	55.53421401977539
6798/28840	Oh it will happen you may be sure said DArtagn	15.789420127868652
6799/28840	So it is agreed and if Porthos makes no objection   I said Porthos I will do whatever you please and besides I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is very	20.59587287902832
6800/28840	But your future career DArtagnanyour ambition Porthos   Our future our ambition replied DArtagnan with feverish volub	28.790971755981445
6801/28840	Or he will forget us added DArtagn	31.857131958007812
6802/28840	It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for Charles	49.68914794921875
6803/28840	but none the less Anne of Austria has forgotten us for twenty	75.51456451416016
6804/28840	Well in spite of that DArtagnan said Athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her   No indeed said DArtagnan I admit even that in my darkest moments I find consolation in that	22.001344680786133
6805/28840	You see then DArtagnan though princes often are ungrateful God never	76.60096740722656
6806/28840	Athos said DArtagnan I believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to	35.6790771484375
6807/28840	So then said Athos offering his hand to DArtagn	5.5648884773254395
6808/28840	I find England a charming country and I staybut on one condition	210.87660217285156
6809/28840	What is it   That I am not forced to learn	33.48146057128906
6810/28840	Well now said Athos triumphantly I swear to you my friend by the God who hears usI believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see France	42.832950592041016
6811/28840	So be it said DArtagnan but II confess I have a contrary	34.47895050048828
6812/28840	Our good DArtagnan said Aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does a	118.7198257446289
6813/28840	But in the meantime saves the country added Ath	38.3819694519043
6814/28840	Well now that everything is decided cried Porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always d	39.1047248840332
6815/28840	Oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink	127.89610290527344
6816/28840	What the devil did you come to such a country for Athos But I forgot added the Gascon smiling pardon I forgot you are no longer Athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner Porth	32.18243408203125
6817/28840	My plan   Yes have you a plan   No I am hungry that is	26.692842483520508
6818/28840	Mouston appeared with a most piteous	268.61492919921875
6819/28840	What is the matter my dear	18.51203155517578
6820/28840	Are you ill   Sir I am very hungry replied M	38.4942512512207
6821/28840	Well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good	47.45125961303711
6822/28840	Could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel Faith I do not remember the name of the	51.860313415527344
6823/28840	At the hotel of said Porthos by my faithnor do I remember it	77.4935302734375
6824/28840	How is there a house in the neighborhood asked DArtagn	14.721553802490234
6825/28840	Well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that	66.47293853759766
6826/28840	What is your opinion gentlemen and does not	80.12728118896484
6827/28840	But if he should be a cavalier said Porth	16.751985549926758
6828/28840	In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowl	61.42300796508789
6829/28840	You are very happy exclaimed Athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible Gascon for you see the bright side of	51.58422088623047
6830/28840	I come from a land where there is not a cloud in the	63.55683898925781
6831/28840	It is not like this then said Porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of	48.089324951171875
6832/28840	Come come said DArtagnan more reason why we should start on our	24.582006454467773
6833/28840	Well Grimaud my friend have you seen anything asked the Gas	35.59373092651367
6834/28840	Those idiots cried Porthos they have not even pursued	87.12943267822266
6835/28840	Oh if we had been in their place   Yes they are wrong said DArtagn	16.411083221435547
6836/28840	I would willingly have said two words to Mordaunt in this little	49.175254821777344
6837/28840	It is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper	186.0354766845703
6838/28840	I think decidedly observed Aramis gentlemen that the son hasnt his mothers	131.27633666992188
6839/28840	What my good fellow replied Athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we	48.351104736328125
6840/28840	We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France if we are not poisoned or killed before	48.435768127441406
6841/28840	Ifaith yes said Athos for I am	79.7000503540039
6842/28840	Look out for the black fowls cried Aram	85.14599609375
6843/28840	And the four friends guided by Mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as Athos had said all four once more united and of single	51.56143569946289
6844/28840	As our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded	57.942691802978516
6845/28840	Before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted	174.1905975341797
6846/28840	Egad cried DArtagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by	42.28336715698242
6847/28840	The devil said Porthos in that case they have eaten	37.95001220703125
6848/28840	Bah said DArtagnan they will have left a chicken at	25.074050903320312
6849/28840	He dismounted and knocked on the	44.38025665283203
6850/28840	He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and	62.91376876831055
6851/28840	Aha   What   Blood   At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and	28.141368865966797
6852/28840	DArtagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary	32.31672668457031
6853/28840	The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of	33.865814208984375
6854/28840	It was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do	22.16352653503418
6855/28840	Athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to	33.08251190185547
6856/28840	Well if he is dead said Athos he has not been so long for he is still	18.002704620361328
6857/28840	Ho there my friend   The wounded man heaved a	52.87895202636719
6858/28840	DArtagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his	15.424375534057617
6859/28840	The man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back	17.56001091003418
6860/28840	The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing cop	49.57111358642578
6861/28840	Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the g	54.29535675048828
6862/28840	Again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity	22.73566436767578
6863/28840	You are among friends said Athos in English so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened   The king muttered the wounded man the king is a	30.374025344848633
6864/28840	You have seen him asked Aramis in the same	49.39266586303711
6865/28840	Make your mind easy resumed Athos we are all faithful servants of his	45.374778747558594
6866/28840	Is what you tell me true asked the wounded	42.1225471496582
6867/28840	I am brother to Parry his majestys lac	62.200138092041016
6868/28840	Athos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings	28.30665397644043
6869/28840	We know him said Athos he never left the	48.55187225341797
6870/28840	Well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was	40.75001907348633
6871/28840	They brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and	69.26384735107422
6872/28840	Parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at	140.80223083496094
6873/28840	He knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the or	28.167434692382812
6874/28840	He made a sign which I understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and held themselves on	68.66223907470703
6875/28840	I went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow	35.22285079956055
6876/28840	But Parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he	58.332298278808594
6877/28840	The king was a few steps behind me when suddenly I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge	65.59489440917969
6878/28840	I wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment I felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell ins	40.39995574951172
6879/28840	When I came to myself again I was stretched in the same	49.92231369018555
6880/28840	I dragged myself as far as the	112.38629150390625
6881/28840	The king and his escort were no longer	29.112638473510742
6882/28840	I spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and I fainted	143.45242309570312
6883/28840	And now how are you feeling   Very ill replied the wounded	50.60927963256836
6884/28840	Can we do anything for you asked Ath	90.0920181274414
6885/28840	Help to put me on the bed I think I shall feel better	55.40729904174805
6886/28840	Have you any one to depend on for assistance   My wife is at Durham and may return at any	96.61012268066406
6887/28840	But youis there nothing that you want   We came here with the intention of asking for something to	59.50716781616211
6888/28840	Alas they have taken everything there isnt a morsel of bread in the	79.83872985839844
6889/28840	You hear DArtagnan said Athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our	23.19903564453125
6890/28840	It is all one to me now said DArtagnan I am no longer	21.423084259033203
6891/28840	They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the	75.483642578125
6892/28840	In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a	73.5667724609375
6893/28840	In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel	62.13693618774414
6894/28840	Now said Aramis we know how the matter	29.52117919921875
6895/28840	The king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh   Athos did not reply he	47.06352996826172
6896/28840	Yes said Porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of	25.610309600830078
6897/28840	What a confounded country this England is This is the first time I have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best	54.29533004760742
6898/28840	What do you think DArtagnan asked Ath	7.3383002281188965
6899/28840	Do you agree with Aramis   Not at all said DArtagnan I am precisely of the contrary	21.374317169189453
6900/28840	What you would follow the escort exclaimed Porthos in	81.02284240722656
6901/28840	Let DArtagnan speak said Athos you know he always has wise advice to	50.30377197265625
6902/28840	Clearly said DArtagnan we must go where they will not look for	16.62833023071289
6903/28840	Now they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans therefore with the Puritans we must	48.89549255371094
6904/28840	I was about to give it when you anticipated	38.46772766113281
6905/28840	That then is your opinion asked Aram	49.221622467041016
6906/28840	They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach London with the	29.020532608032227
6907/28840	Once in London we shall be hard to findwithout considering continued Athos throwing a glance at Aramis the chances that may come to us on the	43.23585891723633
6908/28840	I however do not understand said Porth	18.15054702758789
6909/28840	But no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of DArtagnan and of Athos it must be the	21.246509552001953
6910/28840	But said Aramis shall we not be suspected by Colonel Harrison   Egad cried DArtagnan hes just the man I count	28.284143447875977
6911/28840	Colonel Harrison is one of our	24.39046859741211
6912/28840	We have met him twice at General Cromwell	48.67216110229492
6913/28840	He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin he will consider us as	35.257667541503906
6914/28840	Besides is he not a butchers son Well then Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the	63.892913818359375
6915/28840	You are the best companion that I know DArtagnan he said offering his hand to the Gascon and I am very happy in having found you again my dear	20.86992073059082
6916/28840	This was as we have seen the term which Athos applied to DArtagnan in his more expansive mood	22.960384368896484
6917/28840	He had stanched the wound and the man was	120.04928588867188
6918/28840	The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his	55.50006103515625
6919/28840	Tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me	59.14481735229492
6920/28840	However insignificant I am I am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my	54.33724594116211
6921/28840	Be easy said DArtagnan he will know all before	57.71995544433594
6922/28840	The little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league	34.46707534790039
6923/28840	My dear friends said DArtagnan give your swords to Monsieur Mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our	21.34465789794922
6924/28840	It was not long before they joined the	90.08369445800781
6925/28840	The king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale	28.618915557861328
6926/28840	DArtagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of Porthos went straight to Harrison who recognized him as having met him at Cromwells and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition	30.474613189697266
6927/28840	It turned out as DArtagnan had fore	28.69750213623047
6928/28840	The colonel neither had nor could have any	129.4865264892578
6929/28840	They halted for the king to d	75.20700073242188
6930/28840	This time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at	142.7161102294922
6931/28840	In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the	56.279197692871094
6932/28840	Will you dine with me asked Harrison of DArtagn	32.97043228149414
6933/28840	Gad I should be very happy but I have my companion Monsieur du Vallon and the two prisoners whom I cannot	25.466121673583984
6934/28840	Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from	110.83770751953125
6935/28840	The matter was arranged as DArtagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where Parry waited on him Harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his	57.75861740112305
6936/28840	The table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention Harrison sat with his back to the	72.2249526977539
6937/28840	The king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of	45.969085693359375
6938/28840	They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on	57.0372200012207
6939/28840	The officers table and that of the king were opposite to	66.65760803222656
6940/28840	Ifaith colonel said DArtagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without	77.75537109375
6941/28840	My friend here Monsieur du Vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly	64.353271484375
6942/28840	And I am so still said Porthos bowing to	39.38285446166992
6943/28840	And how said Harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you   In a very simple manner colonel said DArtagn	45.9936408996582
6944/28840	I was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone	36.23017883300781
6945/28840	Yes said Harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his	40.774864196777344
6946/28840	When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing theres no need to go over the ground a second	53.2618408203125
6947/28840	Ah it was this gentleman said DArtagnan bowing to the	14.389734268188477
6948/28840	I am sorry he does not speak French that I might tender him my	76.40528869628906
6949/28840	I am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good French for I resided three years in	76.24108123779297
6950/28840	Then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your	40.93273162841797
6951/28840	Nearly I thought I had quite said Gros	41.89939880371094
6952/28840	It was a very near thing but he is not	48.062618255615234
6953/28840	As he said this DArtagnan gave a glance at Parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for	21.083999633789062
6954/28840	The king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed	127.48268127441406
6955/28840	Hang it said Groslow I thought I had succeeded	163.48912048339844
6956/28840	If it were not so far from here to the house I would return and finish	74.2052001953125
6957/28840	And you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a	63.81782531738281
6958/28840	And DArtagnan threw a second glance toward Parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to him	28.331449508666992
6959/28840	Parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it	157.60711669921875
6960/28840	Ive a great desire to drink the kings health said Ath	33.47057342529297
6961/28840	Let me propose it then said DArtagn	45.3375358581543
6962/28840	Porthos looked at DArtagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions Gascon sharpness continually supplied	38.30134201049805
6963/28840	DArtagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and	34.767730712890625
6964/28840	Gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the rep	119.59956359863281
6965/28840	Heres to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as London and	119.08013153076172
6966/28840	And as DArtagnan as he spoke looked at Harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for	47.829715728759766
6967/28840	He arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on Charles while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest mis	47.011112213134766
6968/28840	The king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and	50.4961051940918
6969/28840	Come gentlemen cried Harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be	43.710941314697266

6973/28840	If what you say is sincere replied Athos he will never reach	44.54641342163086
6974/28840	How so   Because before then we shall have carried him	50.21198654174805
6975/28840	Well this time Athos said DArtagnan upon my word you are	15.346647262573242
6976/28840	Have you some plan in your head then asked Aram	67.37899780273438
6977/28840	Ay said Porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good	36.736854553222656
6978/28840	I have none said Athos but DArtagnan will discover	20.398365020751953
6979/28840	DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders and they	16.22990608215332

6981/28840	The four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the	72.09107971191406
6982/28840	They withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an	74.32794189453125
6983/28840	The lackeys were sent to their several posts except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the	39.97817611694336
6984/28840	DArtagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loqu	29.781774520874023
6985/28840	Porthos who could never see anything that was not selfevident talked to him as	40.266204833984375
6986/28840	He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one	48.55445098876953
6987/28840	Next morning DArtagnan was the first to	36.59957504272461
6988/28840	He had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and Porthos sn	32.84413146972656
6989/28840	At eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that DArtagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Gros	32.63896942138672
6990/28840	Groslow whom DArtagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious	37.839969635009766
6991/28840	Really sir DArtagnan said to him I am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor	46.300594329833984
6992/28840	My friend Monsieur du Vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all	36.20474624633789
6993/28840	As for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for	73.92375946044922
6994/28840	The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the Stuart for whom I hope youre preparing a pretty	87.0423583984375
6995/28840	Why said Groslow that is just what we are taking him to London	29.20733642578125
6996/28840	And you never by any chance lose sight of him I presume   I should think not	37.31245040893555
6997/28840	You see he has a truly royal	367.415283203125
6998/28840	Ay theres no fear in the daytime but at night   We redouble our	89.38703918457031

7000/28840	The deuce he is well guarded	74.51940155029297

7004/28840	Under pretense that hes a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without	206.58094787597656
7005/28840	Really captain said DArtagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more I listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak	43.48147964477539
7006/28840	You have lived three years in Paris May I ask what you were doing there   My father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in	66.72299194335938
7007/28840	Were you pleased with Paris sir   Yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our ownnot against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an Italian the queens	89.31140899658203
7008/28840	Ah I am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorrupt	44.29142379760742
7009/28840	But said the officer I thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Crom	17.554668426513672
7010/28840	That is to say I am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to England I solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three	53.30708312988281
7011/28840	So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England you see how we snapped up the	64.95641326904297
7012/28840	Yes I know that you charged by the side of Mord	31.621381759643555

7014/28840	Do you know him asked the	28.527219772338867
7015/28840	Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from France with	20.98806381225586
7016/28840	It appears too you kept him waiting a long time at Boulog	81.02430725097656
7017/28840	What would you have I was like you and had a king in	110.113525390625

7020/28840	How do you mean   I mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking d	54.70804977416992
7021/28840	Ah true said the Englishman with a sigh you Frenchmen are born boon	37.814605712890625
7022/28840	And dont you play too when you are on guard   Never said the English	39.61283493041992
7023/28840	In that case you must be horribly bored and have my	102.6120834350586
7024/28840	The fact is I look to my turn for keeping guard with	270.6170349121094
7025/28840	Its tiresome work to keep awake a whole	259.5583190917969
7026/28840	Yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a	42.70692825317383
7027/28840	You dont like playing then   On the contrary I	38.35307312011719
7028/28840	Lansquenet for instance   Devoted to	133.6310272216797
7029/28840	I used to play almost every night in	213.9403839111328
7030/28840	And since your return to England   I have not handled a card or dice	50.17816925048828
7031/28840	I sincerely pity you said DArtagnan with an air of profound	17.86979103088379
7032/28840	Well   Tomorrow I am on	41.92041015625
7033/28840	In Stuarts room   Yes come and pass the night with	52.72892379760742
7034/28840	Impossible   Impossible why so   I play with Monsieur du Vallon every	30.689926147460938
7035/28840	Sometimes we dont go to bed at all   Well what of that   Why he would be annoyed if I did not play with	26.96645736694336
7036/28840	Does he play well   I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled	68.46578216552734
7037/28840	But how about our prisoners   Let your servants guard	85.3402099609375
7038/28840	Yes and give them a chance of escaping said DArtagn	17.279937744140625
7039/28840	Why one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta of noble	38.765708923339844
7040/28840	We have arranged the ransom of each of them2000 on arriving in	65.29351043701172
7041/28840	We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be	115.05622863769531
7042/28840	It is true we plundered them a little when we took them and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly	41.59217834472656
7043/28840	Still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their	68.92637634277344
7044/28840	We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon	42.63225555419922
7045/28840	You see then why I must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or	113.863037109375
7046/28840	Ah said Groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at	25.805335998535156
7047/28840	But come resumed the Englishman are these men of yours dangerous   In what respect   Are they capable of attempting violence   DArtagnan burst out laughing at the	37.429222106933594
7048/28840	Well then said Groslow bring them with	53.78224182128906
7049/28840	I have eight men on guard you	108.10233306884766
7050/28840	Four of them can guard the king and the other four your	82.15117645263672
7051/28840	Ill manage it somehow you will	469.7070617675781
7052/28840	But said DArtagnan now I think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight   Nothing at all said Gros	23.250215530395508
7053/28840	Come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your	62.966773986816406
7054/28840	Capital This evening with you tomorrow at Stuarts the next day with	81.96376037597656
7055/28840	You see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said DArtagn	64.3443374633789
7056/28840	Yes with Frenchmen and Frenchmen like	58.65509033203125
7057/28840	And Monsieur du Vallon added the	14.111772537231445
7058/28840	You will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed Mazarin between two	63.096012115478516
7059/28840	They employ him because they are afraid of	77.54650115966797
7060/28840	Ah there he is calling me	223.05850219726562
7061/28840	They exchanged bows and DArtagnan returned to his	24.055126190185547
7062/28840	What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed Porth	47.74319839477539
7063/28840	My dear fellow dont speak like that of Monsieur Gros	17.588916778564453
7064/28840	Hes one of my most intimate	33.8382682800293
7065/28840	One of your friends cried Porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers   Hush my dear Porth	19.171812057495117
7066/28840	Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and	76.9483871459961
7067/28840	Porthos opened his eyes in amazement Athos and Aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew DArtagnan and knew that he did nothing without a	25.6236629486084
7068/28840	But continued DArtagnan you shall judge of him for	31.878299713134766
7069/28840	He is coming to play with us this	26.788137435913086
7070/28840	Oho said Porthos his eyes glistening at the	35.84910202026367
7071/28840	Is he rich   Hes the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in	59.68662643432617
7072/28840	And knows lansquenet   Adores	418.9875793457031
7073/28840	Good said Porthos we shall pass an agreeable	41.20935821533203
7074/28840	The more so as it will be the prelude to a	65.17481231689453
7075/28840	How so   We invite him to play tonight he has invited us in return	79.23812103271484
7076/28840	Tonight we stop at Derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let Mousqueton buy	31.51323127746582
7077/28840	It will be well to prepare a light supper of which you Athos and Aramis are not to partakeAthos because I told him you had a fever Aramis because you are a knight of Malta and wont mix with fellows like	55.87156295776367
7078/28840	Do you understand   Thats no doubt very fine said Porthos but deuce take me if I understand at	25.727304458618164
7079/28840	Porthos my friend you know I am descended on the fathers side from the Prophets and on the mothers from the Sybils and that I only speak in parables and r	56.142066955566406
7080/28840	Let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see I can tell you nothing more at	84.74923706054688
7081/28840	Go ahead my friend said Athos I am sure that whatever you do is well	54.59758758544922
7082/28840	And you Aramis are you of that opinion   Entirely so my dear DArtagn	13.546448707580566
7083/28840	Very good said DArtagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving Porthos who must see and touch before he will	53.72153854370117
7084/28840	The fact is said Porthos with an air of finesse I am rather incred	18.675662994384766
7085/28840	DArtagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended	30.832735061645508
7086/28840	At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed	68.91693878173828
7087/28840	In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome	40.44086456298828
7088/28840	It was there a lodging was prepared for	87.52686309814453
7089/28840	At the hour agreed upon Groslow	116.39593505859375
7090/28840	DArtagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years	15.979033470153809
7091/28840	Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to Parrys brother he was not nearly so strong as	32.09250259399414
7092/28840	Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and	49.62757873535156
7093/28840	In short Groslow seemed to be pleased with his	50.15685272216797
7094/28840	Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their	30.1337947845459
7095/28840	At midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly	101.09259796142578
7096/28840	Furthermore DArtagnan went with them leaving Porthos at play with Gros	24.697952270507812
7097/28840	Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to	26.626859664916992
7098/28840	As to Groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from DArtagnan what he had lost to Porthos and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his	28.952329635620117
7099/28840	The next day was spent as	131.1564483642578
7100/28840	DArtagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his	18.702051162719727
7101/28840	To any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto Athos and Aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gay	39.259056091308594
7102/28840	Porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole	34.20335006713867
7103/28840	Arrived at Ryston DArtagnan assembled his	48.261478424072266
7104/28840	His face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole	91.55776977539062
7105/28840	The moment is at hand he	184.453125
7106/28840	Yes returned DArtagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the	49.966346740722656
7107/28840	DArtagnan said Athos this is no joke I trust It would quite cut me	44.51078414916992
7108/28840	You are a very odd man Athos he replied to doubt me	93.73757934570312
7109/28840	Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friends heart and a kings life I have told you and I repeat it that tonight we rescue Charles	63.11921310424805
7110/28840	You left it to me to discover the means and I have done	39.476924896240234
7111/28840	Porthos looked at DArtagnan with an expression of profound	4.749644756317139
7112/28840	Athos was pale and trembled in every	38.162227630615234
7113/28840	We are invited replied DArtagnan to pass the night with	31.02996826171875
7114/28840	But do you know where  	24.76728630065918
7115/28840	Groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him	82.1058349609375
7116/28840	Pardieu certainly all four we couldnt leave our prisoners could we   Ah ah said Aram	38.162498474121094
7117/28840	Tell us about it said Athos palpit	42.14679718017578

7119/28840	We four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid	400.38262939453125
7120/28840	Monsieur Porthos what do you say to that   I say it is easy enough answered Porth	9.401592254638672
7121/28840	We dress the king in Groslows	355.2691345214844
7122/28840	Mousqueton Grimaud and Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first	15.111499786376953
7123/28840	We mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues	180.76026916503906
7124/28840	Athos placed his two hands on DArtagnans shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad	17.100858688354492
7125/28840	I declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in	71.11579132080078
7126/28840	Whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldnt share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in	242.75506591796875
7127/28840	I repeat it DArtagnan you are the best one among us I bless and love you my dear	31.285808563232422
7128/28840	And to think that I couldnt find that out said Porthos scratching his head it is so	28.35890007019043
7129/28840	But said Aramis if I understand rightly we are to kill them all eh   Athos shuddered and turned	16.758970260620117
7130/28840	Mordioux answered DArtagnan I believe we	44.12201690673828
7131/28840	I confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory	94.40811157226562
7132/28840	Let us see said Aramis how are we to act   I have arranged two	42.93514633178711
7133/28840	Firstly at a given signal which shall be the words At last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to	103.20062255859375
7134/28840	We on our side do the	49.656211853027344
7135/28840	We shall then be matched four against the remaining	249.55862426757812
7136/28840	If these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill	104.97280883789062
7137/28840	If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only Porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of	82.84040069580078
7138/28840	It will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper	61.28547668457031
7139/28840	But if you yourselves should be struck said Ath	63.412986755371094
7140/28840	Impossible said DArtagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and	56.69685363769531
7141/28840	Besides you will strike at the throat Porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all	135.6588592529297
7142/28840	Very good said Porthos it will be a nice little throat	58.48469924926758
7143/28840	Nonsense said DArtagnan you would do as much	47.835750579833984
7144/28840	But if you think the kings life is not worth what it must cost theres an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am	43.02739334106445
7145/28840	At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting for	41.38823699951172
7146/28840	In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch Pur	13.89174747467041
7147/28840	Good replied Athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are	88.54180145263672
7148/28840	The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was	23.27882957458496
7149/28840	It was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an	15.976622581481934
7150/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos armed with their swords and Athos and Aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was Charles Stuarts	42.6697998046875
7151/28840	The two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without	140.7655029296875
7152/28840	Ods bodikins said Groslow as the four friends entered I had almost given you	71.85725402832031
7153/28840	DArtagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear   The fact is we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I hesitated a	12.955592155456543
7154/28840	And why   DArtagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aram	9.022268295288086
7155/28840	Aha said Groslow on account of political opinions No	68.55189514160156
7156/28840	On the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their Stuart they shall see	44.216087341308594
7157/28840	Are we to pass the night in the kings room asked DArtagn	18.592262268066406
7158/28840	No but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same	67.5096664428711
7159/28840	Have you provided yourself with money I assure you I intend to play the devils game	143.11196899414062
7160/28840	DArtagnan rattled the gold in his	33.206974029541016
7161/28840	Very good said Groslow and opened the door of the	24.2823429107666
7162/28840	I will show you the way and he went in	24.546463012695312
7163/28840	DArtagnan turned to look at his	15.948737144470215
7164/28840	Porthos was perfectly indifferent Athos pale but resolute Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his	56.57476043701172
7165/28840	The eight guards were at their	155.88714599609375
7166/28840	Four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had	35.14466857910156
7167/28840	Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good	67.98003387451172
7168/28840	A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less	95.72016143798828
7169/28840	From time to time Parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but Charles would open his eyes and say with a smile   Go on my good Parry I am	45.28558349609375
7170/28840	Capital cried the Gascon you would make a distinguished	63.189022064208984
7171/28840	And do you think asked Groslow that Stuart will ever escape while I am on guard   No to be sure replied DArtagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon	37.06807327270508
7172/28840	It is impossible to say whether Charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of DArtagnans voice his eyelids rose in spite of	37.64329147338867
7173/28840	What are you thinking about said the king go on my good Parry unless you are	46.12458419799805
7174/28840	On a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two diceboxes and	78.98217010498047
7175/28840	Gentlemen said Groslow I beg you will take your	113.48805236816406
7176/28840	I will sit facing Stuart whom I like so much to see especially where he now is and you Monsieur dArtagnan opposite to	56.654266357421875
7177/28840	Thats it said DArtagnan you Monsieur le Comte de la Fere to the right of Monsieur Gros	9.251455307006836
7178/28840	Youll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur Gros	66.71243286132812
7179/28840	By this arrangement DArtagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aram	26.675111770629883
7180/28840	At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier dHerblay Charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the	19.34557342529297
7181/28840	At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah   God said Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom I have sent unto	70.79521179199219
7182/28840	The words that Parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real	86.85123443603516
7183/28840	You asked me just now if I was in funds said DArtagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the	40.19452667236328
7184/28840	Well in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear Monsieur Groslow for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of	28.37533950805664
7185/28840	Not without my defending it said Gros	72.01802825927734
7186/28840	You know or you dont know that that is what we ask of	62.79344177246094
7187/28840	Oh yes said Groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and	44.315032958984375
7188/28840	Charles had heard and understood it	72.59557342529297
7189/28840	A slight color mounted to his	93.61206817626953
7190/28840	The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered	122.93661499023438
7191/28840	Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes	30.368144989013672
7192/28840	The luck had turned and Groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible	87.21623229980469
7193/28840	Porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned DArtagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the	42.935977935791016
7194/28840	Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiring	12.220197677612305
7195/28840	They heard the guard going its	1167.4862060546875
7196/28840	How many rounds do they make a night asked DArtagnan drawing more pistoles from his	47.40349578857422
7197/28840	Five answered Groslow one every two	235.14944458007812
7198/28840	DArtagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to Porthoss nudge of the knee by a nudge	16.448884963989258
7199/28840	Those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the	57.81761169433594
7200/28840	The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the	47.26612091064453
7201/28840	Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment	171.69850158691406
7202/28840	With his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pew	72.59844970703125
7203/28840	Aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poni	93.62982940673828
7204/28840	Porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his	139.930908203125
7205/28840	DArtagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to	32.848880767822266
7206/28840	DArtagnan saw that the moment was	21.02014923095703
7207/28840	He darted a preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for	50.00808334350586
7208/28840	He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabb	23.578393936157227
7209/28840	Hang it cried DArtagnan another twenty pistoles	177.9862518310547
7210/28840	Really Captain Groslow you are too much in fortunes	85.7080078125
7211/28840	This cant last and he drew another twenty from his	171.04974365234375
7212/28840	One more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throwonly one the	265.5034484863281
7213/28840	And he turned up two cards as usual a king for DArtagnan and an ace for	66.85841369628906
7214/28840	A king said DArtagnan its a good omen Master Groslowlook out for the	71.73336029052734
7215/28840	And in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the Gascons voice which made his partner	26.174654006958008
7216/28840	Groslow began turning the cards one after	277.846435546875
7217/28840	If he turned up an ace first he won if a king he	281.4763488769531
7218/28840	At this word Athos and Aramis jumped	26.867647171020508
7219/28840	Daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large	37.10318374633789
7220/28840	Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen	29.076854705810547
7221/28840	Groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and	86.85565948486328
7222/28840	But Harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the kings room followed by his companion   Charles Stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to London without stopping day or	55.49019241333008
7223/28840	Prepare yourself then to start at	170.07272338867188
7224/28840	And by whom is this order given asked the	97.33130645751953
7225/28840	Mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its	246.947509765625
7226/28840	Mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging	609.1703491210938
7227/28840	DArtagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in his huge	38.36989212036133
7228/28840	Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind	22.35254669189453
7229/28840	At this movement Mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage	45.39911651611328
7230/28840	Im afraid we are prisoners whispered DArtagnan to his	34.3165283203125
7231/28840	Colonel colonel cried Mordaunt you are	146.75083923339844
7232/28840	These four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the	58.61099624633789
7233/28840	Ah my young man said DArtagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than	55.08646011352539
7234/28840	Fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around	120.22819519042969
7235/28840	The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their musk	34.727542877197266
7236/28840	Porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the	70.82353973388672
7237/28840	Fire cried Mordaunt fire upon them   Three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and	38.81803512573242
7238/28840	The horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their sadd	40.902061462402344
7239/28840	Forward cried DArtagnan and spur for your dear lives   They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward	47.531593322753906
7240/28840	A few hundred yards beyond the town DArtagnan drew	71.83512115478516
7241/28840	Halt he cried this time we shall be	240.37876892089844
7242/28840	We must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite	52.82355880737305
7243/28840	There was a stream close by and a bridge across	173.09689331054688
7244/28840	DArtagnan led his horse under the arch of the	32.746185302734375
7245/28840	Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horse	19.02566146850586
7246/28840	A few minutes more and the troop passed over their	52.95960235595703
7247/28840	As soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance DArtagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward	29.270822525024414
7248/28840	This time said DArtagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot I think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach	22.001895904541016
7249/28840	What do you say Athos to that proposition Isnt it reasonable   Yes dear friend Athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonableit was noble and	46.866981506347656
7250/28840	You said Let us die here I recall to you that	141.60061645507812
7251/28840	Oh said Porthos death is nothing it isnt death that can disquiet us since we dont know what it	46.418495178222656
7252/28840	What troubles me is the idea of	201.8897247314453
7253/28840	As things are turning out I foresee that we must give battle to London to the provinces to all England and certainly in the end we cant fail to be	99.89672088623047
7254/28840	We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said Ath	79.79617309570312
7255/28840	Whatever happens let us not leave England before the	286.70257568359375
7256/28840	Dont you agree with me Aramis   Entirely my dear	15.499784469604492
7257/28840	Then too I confess I should not be sorry to come across Mordaunt	65.66972351074219
7258/28840	It appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at	35.5573844909668
7259/28840	Ah thats another thing said DArtagnan and I should not mind waiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in	54.684207916259766
7260/28840	Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for I imagine just now that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with	49.44236373901367
7261/28840	Athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin   I think I know what you want replied Ath	35.70665740966797
7262/28840	De Winter took us to the house of a Spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an Englishman by the guineas of his new compat	52.91299057006836
7263/28840	What do you say to it Aramis   Why the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part I agree to	36.443973541259766
7264/28840	You forget Aramis one precaution of considerable	280.3708190917969
7265/28840	What is that   The precaution of changing our	61.7392578125
7266/28840	I dont see why we are very comfortable in those we	129.7177276611328
7267/28840	Our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the Frenchman at first	200.4130859375
7268/28840	Now I dont set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for change of scene to the	126.76091766357422
7269/28840	Ive remarked that your Puritans revel in that	127.95344543457031
7270/28840	But can you find your man said Aramis to Ath	43.29972457885742
7271/28840	He lives at the Bedford Tavern Greenhall	21.641115188598633
7272/28840	Besides I can find my way about the city with my eyes	58.68208694458008
7273/28840	I wish we were already there said DArtagnan and my advice is that we reach London before daybreak even if we kill our	30.353567123413086
7274/28840	Come on then said Athos for unless I am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to	39.625144958496094
7275/28840	The friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the	16.648792266845703
7276/28840	They were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but Athos replied in excellent English that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce to his colleague Monsieur Bridge the approach of the	41.400909423828125
7277/28840	That reply led to several questions about the kings capture and Athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished	187.64993286132812
7278/28840	The way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of Puritan	86.37635803222656
7279/28840	He went direct to the Bedford Tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising	63.616268157958984
7280/28840	Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the	66.8423843383789
7281/28840	The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously	196.97171020507812
7282/28840	The landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his	114.0645980834961
7283/28840	Athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable	37.61491394042969
7284/28840	Aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a military	48.956485748291016
7285/28840	Porthos was seduced by a winecolored doublet and seagreen bree	30.68343734741211
7286/28840	DArtagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar	74.70781707763672

7290/28840	This as you know is the important point of distinction between the Covenanter and the Caval	83.89778900146484
7291/28840	After some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role of bar	149.78208923339844
7292/28840	And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent said Aram	48.18912124633789
7293/28840	My head feels actually cold said Porth	129.15687561035156
7294/28840	As for me I feel anxious to preach a sermon said DArtagn	18.039648056030273
7295/28840	Now said Athos that we cannot even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the kings	43.650047302246094
7296/28840	They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings	81.10381317138672
7297/28840	A carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic Porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage	42.4568977355957
7298/28840	DArtagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the	27.42667579650879
7299/28840	The next day Athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the Act of Parliament which summoned the exking Charles	65.4473648071289
7300/28840	Parliament can never have passed such an act as	288.9443359375
7301/28840	At this moment the landlord came	48.00307846069336
7302/28840	Did parliament pass this act Athos asked of him in	385.6358947753906
7303/28840	As to Porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast	45.625022888183594
7304/28840	You were asking then said the host in	139.09005737304688
7305/28840	Oh the devil said Porthos I am sorry for that it would have been one language	26.250179290771484
7306/28840	When I speak of the pure parliament resumed the host I mean the one which Colonel Bridge has we	131.13900756835938
7307/28840	Ah really said DArtagnan these people are very	33.281131744384766
7308/28840	When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadj	37.90599822998047
7309/28840	One of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there wont be any parliament at	32.16447067260742
7310/28840	Now of two hundred and fiftyone members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninetyone who were in the way and might have upset his political	42.51448059082031
7311/28840	He took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the	42.89744186401367
7312/28840	Very   And all these one hundred and ninetyone were Royalists asked Ath	41.57750701904297
7313/28840	Without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the	49.073768615722656
7314/28840	To be sure said Porthos with majestic common sense they were in the	63.6328010559082
7315/28840	And you think said Aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal   He will be forced to do so smiled the Spani	44.14118957519531
7316/28840	But said Aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or	73.14537811279297
7317/28840	DArtagnan whistled a little air of incredul	18.464406967163086
7318/28840	We shall see said Athos for we shall go to the sittings I	43.99164962768555
7319/28840	You will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin	91.58353424072266
7320/28840	So then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken   Of course said DArtagnan they began the day he was	39.06095886230469
7321/28840	And you know said Aramis that it was our friend Mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overt	44.773990631103516
7322/28840	And you know added DArtagnan that whenever I catch him I will kill him this Mord	31.408287048339844
7323/28840	Touching unanimity cried DArtagnan which well becomes good citizens like	72.11772155761719
7324/28840	Let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little	51.453826904296875
7325/28840	Yes said Porthos twill be at least a little change from	33.158626556396484
7326/28840	was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge	205.71974182128906
7327/28840	All London was crowding to the doors of the	86.43424987792969
7328/28840	The throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their	172.19873046875
7329/28840	The judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his	77.98291015625
7330/28840	Charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over	47.81253433227539
7331/28840	Then when the officer was gone he sat down in the armchair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his	26.111618041992188
7332/28840	Parry who accompanied him stood behind	561.6820678710938
7333/28840	DArtagnan was looking at Athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his	26.53629493713379
7334/28840	This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos frightened	86.63994598388672
7335/28840	I hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this	66.92676544189453
7336/28840	Set your mind at rest replied Ath	57.139137268066406
7337/28840	Aha continued DArtagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being	65.30509185791016
7338/28840	They had only halberds before now they have musk	74.77710723876953
7339/28840	The halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for	49.8348388671875
7340/28840	Thirty forty fifty sixtyfive men said Porthos counting the	168.78921508789062
7341/28840	Ah said Aramis but you forget the	32.29938888549805
7342/28840	He recognized Mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the	53.128028869628906
7343/28840	Do you think they have recognized us said DArtagn	22.999332427978516
7344/28840	In that case I should beat a	73.19971466064453
7345/28840	I dont care to be shot in a	57.68363952636719
7346/28840	No said Aramis he has not seen	16.868051528930664
7347/28840	He sees no one but the	72.4176254272461
7348/28840	Mon Dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog Does he hate his majesty as much as he does us   Pardi answered Athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and	68.25537109375
7349/28840	True said Aramis but silence the president is speaking to the	35.708335876464844
7350/28840	Stuart Bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to	143.1927947998047
7351/28840	The king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for	30.14622688293457
7352/28840	Bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of	62.364044189453125
7353/28840	Out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained	59.69009780883789
7354/28840	When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the	44.692047119140625
7355/28840	Fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be	78.18710327148438
7356/28840	A loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of	86.07124328613281
7357/28840	It is a womans voice cried Aramis faith I would give a good deal if she is young and	43.862762451171875
7358/28840	And he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of	70.1525650024414
7359/28840	By my soul said Aramis she is	54.62877655029297
7360/28840	Look DArtagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of Bradshaws gaze she has not turned	36.48212814331055
7361/28840	It is Lady Fairfax herself said DArtagn	38.618568420410156
7362/28840	Dont you remember Porthos we saw her at General Cromwells   The roll call	32.59097671508789
7363/28840	These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the Comte de la F	33.159000396728516
7364/28840	Is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him Ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look with	38.07234573364258
7365/28840	The king is really very handsome said Porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is	49.43407440185547
7366/28840	The feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pist	37.65521240234375
7367/28840	The roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of	187.11961364746094
7368/28840	A second time he was disappointed in his	88.11678314208984
7369/28840	Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in	348.6522216796875
7370/28840	I told you so Athos said DArtagnan shrugging his	8.14222526550293
7371/28840	Now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and	93.35948944091797
7372/28840	Never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly	289.29461669921875
7373/28840	Charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty	95.20774841308594
7374/28840	The fact is said DArtagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves	56.83826446533203
7375/28840	But it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard	28.137733459472656
7376/28840	In any case Aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is The king can do no	129.6551971435547
7377/28840	Meantime DArtagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the	57.14578628540039
7378/28840	I must speak to him about	26.960474014282227
7379/28840	At this moment the accuser concluded with these words The present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the English	78.81385040283203
7380/28840	At these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind DArtagn	41.03129196166992
7381/28840	Ninetenths of the English people are horrified at what you	41.462242126464844
7382/28840	This voice was that of Athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public	47.196414947509766
7383/28840	King judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were	66.71835327148438
7384/28840	Mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing pale and	241.67333984375
7385/28840	He had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his	133.9257354736328
7386/28840	A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were Fire on that bench he	82.59337615966797
7387/28840	Charles also had recognized the four French	119.57760620117188
7388/28840	He put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful	40.559471130371094
7389/28840	Mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing	103.82644653320312
7390/28840	More than half an hour passed before any one could make himself	64.58557891845703
7391/28840	The judges were looking for a new outbreak from the	87.91046905517578
7392/28840	The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and	114.32673645019531
7393/28840	What have you to say in your defense asked Bradshaw of the	47.89902114868164
7394/28840	Then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner Charles	95.10986328125
7395/28840	Before questioning me he said reply to my	328.865234375
7396/28840	I was free at Newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both	160.00144958496094
7397/28840	Instead of performing your part of this contract as I performed mine you bought me from the Scotch cheaply I know and that does honor to the economic talent of your	84.98609924316406
7398/28840	But because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king	52.88793182373047
7399/28840	To answer you would be to forget	113.05465698242188
7400/28840	I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question	34.9586296081543
7401/28840	To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and I only acknowledge you as my execution	69.24150085449219
7402/28840	And in the middle of a deathlike silence Charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm	43.672977447509766
7403/28840	Why are not my Frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when	58.60563278198242
7404/28840	Well said the president seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent so be	123.4709243774414
7405/28840	We will judge you in spite of your	81.85919952392578
7406/28840	You are accused of treason of abuse of power and	165.26324462890625
7407/28840	Go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in	120.6374740600586
7408/28840	Charles rose and turned toward Parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with	67.85719299316406
7409/28840	Well my dear Parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner   Oh my king said Parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the	24.78989028930664
7410/28840	And why Parry   Do not look I implore you my	70.76915740966797
7411/28840	But what is the matter Speak said Charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded	51.060115814208984
7412/28840	It isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the	83.73979949951172
7413/28840	Fools said Charles do they take me for a coward like themselves You have done well to warn	61.116943359375
7414/28840	When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the	75.38551330566406
7415/28840	And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed	30.517169952392578
7416/28840	When he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening	50.01337814331055
7417/28840	How many people thought he and not one true	330.5079040527344
7418/28840	And as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said   Respect to fallen	82.58821868896484
7419/28840	The king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and	68.39259338378906
7420/28840	It was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final	54.41587448120117
7421/28840	But the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of swordhilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Gros	58.96302032470703
7422/28840	Alas said Charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling	42.581668853759766
7423/28840	He continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of Naz	64.1641845703125
7424/28840	Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose	621.908935546875
7425/28840	The crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Ath	34.8426513671875
7426/28840	Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile Poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own	46.700626373291016
7427/28840	Athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr	102.55094146728516
7428/28840	When the soldier saluted Charles Athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the French gentleman had slipped into his	123.71373748779297
7429/28840	But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his	54.319461822509766
7430/28840	But DArtagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried Wait   Athos	13.980586051940918
7431/28840	DArtagnan leaning on Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several	22.74991798400879
7432/28840	The man took his way toward the	43.792091369628906
7433/28840	The man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his	52.360538482666016
7434/28840	Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the Frenchmen passed some jests from one to	55.50627899169922
7435/28840	I dont know English Athos said DArtagnan but you know it and will interpret for	24.9036808013916
7436/28840	You have befouled the face of your	402.8634338378906
7437/28840	Athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of	65.6669692993164
7438/28840	Aramis at this movement drew his	58.24897003173828
7439/28840	And seizing the butcher by the throat   Porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single	60.33570861816406
7440/28840	Porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed	47.0150260925293
7441/28840	The man fell like an ox beneath the pole	76.54239654541016
7442/28840	His companions horrorstruck could neither move nor cry	77.8385009765625
7443/28840	Tell them this Athos resumed DArtagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the	68.06685638427734
7444/28840	The fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming	136.1652069091797
7445/28840	Justice is done said Porthos wiping his	27.64150047302246

7447/28840	The parliament condemned Charles to death as might have been fore	172.6986083984375
7448/28840	Political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the	108.63053894042969
7449/28840	Such is the atrocious logic of	53.82719802856445
7450/28840	Although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with	193.92237854003906
7451/28840	DArtagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody	59.29645919799805
7452/28840	But by what means As yet he could form no definite plan all must depend on	179.4215850830078
7453/28840	Meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following daythe day appointed by the	35.821624755859375
7454/28840	The only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the London execution	59.2186393737793
7455/28840	The headsman out of the way the sentence could not be	72.30744934082031
7456/28840	True they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the	59.793052673339844
7457/28840	DArtagnan took upon himself that more than difficult	61.49662399291992
7458/28840	Another thing not less essential was to warn Charles Stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their	65.95407104492188
7459/28840	Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit	57.0076904296875
7460/28840	Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cromwells	98.40065002441406
7461/28840	Aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishops place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at White	53.77284622192383
7462/28840	Finally Athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving Englandin case either of failure or of	115.8746109008789

7466/28840	Parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to	105.4957275390625
7467/28840	Charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he was waiting first for Juxon then for martyr	49.66289138793945
7468/28840	At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in	70.99625396728516
7469/28840	In fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a	52.599422454833984
7470/28840	He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the	26.072282791137695
7471/28840	He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was	64.52742767333984

7473/28840	But I shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune I have ruined by my	67.35189056396484
7474/28840	He will speak to me of God and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public	89.52819061279297
7475/28840	And he raised the medallion to his	33.04058837890625
7476/28840	A neighboring church clock slowly struck the	1669.990478515625
7477/28840	The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty	238.2849884033203
7478/28840	These were the ancestors of Charles standing back dimly in their tarnished	115.30602264404297
7479/28840	An awful sadness enveloped the heart of	185.2459716796875
7480/28840	That king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered	46.5373649597168
7481/28840	Suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious	36.195892333984375
7482/28840	The guards retired the room resumed its	411.3926086425781
7483/28840	Juxon cried Charles Juxon thank you my last friend you come at a fitting	139.07803344726562

7486/28840	If its Parry said the bishop I have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who I am and for what I am	44.128875732421875
7487/28840	At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out when Aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of	33.21531295776367
7488/28840	Yes sire interrupted Aramis raising his voice Bishop Juxon the faithful knight of Christ obedient to your majestys	39.91337966918945
7489/28840	Charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a	56.26124572753906
7490/28840	You he said you how did you penetrate hither If they recognize you you are	108.70893859863281
7491/28840	Care not for me sire think only of	194.1422882080078

7495/28840	The king looked at Aramis with aston	9.316803932189941
7496/28840	At this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the	39.135074615478516
7497/28840	I hear said Aramis but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of	24.48628044128418
7498/28840	I know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily	42.43343734741211

7502/28840	I am condemned leave me to my	107.59747314453125
7503/28840	My king said Aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they cannot make an execution	59.2170295715332
7504/28840	What do you mean asked the	12.586424827575684
7505/28840	I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or	38.53737258911133
7506/28840	The scaffold will be ready by tomorrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after	27.8553524017334
7507/28840	How can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of	28.72380828857422
7508/28840	Oh sir cried Parry may you and yours be blessed   How can it be repeated the	55.926395416259766
7509/28840	I must know so that I may assist you if there is any	27.408893585205078
7510/28840	I know nothing about it continued Aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when I left him Tell the king that tomorrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him	39.42332458496094
7511/28840	He has said it and will do	86.3805160522461

7520/28840	Aramis stooped to kiss the kings hand but Charles clasped his and pressed it to his	33.588706970214844
7521/28840	At this moment a man entered without even knocking at the	44.35398864746094
7522/28840	Aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held	41.65248489379883
7523/28840	The man was one of those Puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around Crom	61.17939758300781
7524/28840	What do you want sir said the	17.76660919189453
7525/28840	I desire to know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end said the	30.881305694580078
7526/28840	And what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same	43.81376266479492

7530/28840	After my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man I shall hear you with pleasure	61.503902435302734
7531/28840	The man retired but not before examining the supposed Juxon with an attention which did not escape the	78.87577056884766
7532/28840	Chevalier said the king when the door was closed I believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil	26.334341049194336
7533/28840	Take care that no misfortune befalls you when you	108.70048522949219
7534/28840	I thank your majesty said Aramis but under these robes I have a coat of mail a pistol and a	52.511959075927734
7535/28840	Go then sir and God keep you   The king accompanied him to the door where Aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the anterooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops	24.96550750732422
7536/28840	Everything has succeeded as I expected spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless	122.8716812133789
7537/28840	May God protect you my son for your example has given me at the same time hope and	93.81852722167969
7538/28840	Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to	25.755935668945312
7539/28840	He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large	16.085302352905273
7540/28840	He placed his hand on his dagger and	45.60230255126953

7543/28840	We are to meet our friends at the hotel at	74.82329559326172
7544/28840	It was then striking halfpast ten by	58.06267166137695
7545/28840	Arrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos	88.53060913085938
7546/28840	Alls well he cried as he entered I have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any	76.84033203125

7552/28840	The sum was collected in a	306.2890625
7553/28840	DArtagnan ran out and returned directly	53.469173431396484
7554/28840	Ough and not without a deal of trouble	535.7890625
7555/28840	Has the executioner left London asked Ath	95.7402114868164
7556/28840	Ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by	90.56996154785156

7560/28840	Bravo said Aramis how did you manage it   Like everything else with money but it cost me	69.26124572753906
7561/28840	And where did you get so much money said Ath	36.87544250488281
7562/28840	Had you then that sum   The queens famous diamond answered DArtagnan with a	35.21738815307617
7563/28840	You bought it back then from Monsieur des Essarts asked Porth	35.259788513183594
7564/28840	Yes but it was fated that I should not keep	36.946163177490234
7565/28840	So then we are all right as regards the executioner said Athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call	60.881778717041016
7566/28840	And this one had his said DArtagnan but as good luck would have it just as I thought I should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken	82.44971466064453
7567/28840	In the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the kings window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke	48.737098693847656
7568/28840	Ah cried Aramis that accounts for the cry I	82.05076599121094

7570/28840	And what on earth are you going to do with it asked Ath	18.641828536987305

7573/28840	Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his	423.48907470703125
7574/28840	It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saw	85.24182891845703
7575/28840	Lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his	73.04642486572266
7576/28840	He could not endure it and sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their	59.029212951660156
7577/28840	The sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed Parry to	38.462276458740234
7578/28840	Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black ser	74.25341033935547
7579/28840	Raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower	71.15754699707031
7580/28840	Parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron	103.28121185302734
7581/28840	My friends said Parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly The king wishes to get a	101.29583740234375
7582/28840	One of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of	51.460575103759766
7583/28840	The face of the first was lost to Parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amaz	36.040836334228516
7584/28840	Very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent	139.8493194580078
7585/28840	Tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow	110.18543243408203
7586/28840	These blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of	229.8466339111328
7587/28840	But Parry withdrew thinking he was	255.14292907714844
7588/28840	At the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was	28.870784759521484

7592/28840	The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in	27.425125122070312
7593/28840	It was Athos he had recognized and Porthos who was boring a hole through the	26.978456497192383
7594/28840	This hole communicated with a kind of loftthe space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below	50.69057846069336
7595/28840	Their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the kings room so as to form a kind of trap	45.31179428100586
7596/28840	Day gilded the tops of the	58.41945266723633
7597/28840	The aperture was finished and Athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the kings	64.33633422851562
7598/28840	He had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to	66.22941589355469
7599/28840	DArtagnan returned to change his workmans clothes for his chestnutcolored suit and Porthos to put on his red double	34.91883850097656
7600/28840	As for Aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the kings	27.06667709350586
7601/28840	All three agreed to meet at noon in Whitehall Place to see how things went	168.0841064453125
7602/28840	Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the	23.822561264038086

7614/28840	The trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has	92.48409271240234
7615/28840	In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be	40.795623779296875

7617/28840	Your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other	45.14022445678711
7618/28840	Athos put his arm around Aramiss neck and embraced	48.1041259765625
7619/28840	Now if I die say to DArtagnan that I love him as a son and embrace him for	25.3367862701416

7621/28840	I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the	33.3409423828125
7622/28840	Aramis parted from Athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of Crom	24.799358367919922
7623/28840	He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold	84.32936096191406
7624/28840	Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians DArtagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious	40.00273895263672
7625/28840	Aramis related what had been agreed	34.34120559692383
7626/28840	DArtagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his	19.077674865722656
7627/28840	Bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the	86.22221374511719
7628/28840	What with DArtagnan Grimaud and Mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of	24.995798110961914
7629/28840	I say nothing about Blaisois for he is only fit to hold the	33.29779052734375
7630/28840	Two minutes a man makes four	605.585693359375

7632/28840	Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his	19.553789138793945
7633/28840	Now said he Im off to the	101.16569519042969
7634/28840	Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar	171.6410369873047
7635/28840	I pass my life upon my	92.54920959472656
7636/28840	Aramis again presented himself at the	37.941436767578125
7637/28840	Juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to	72.66851806640625
7638/28840	Dressed as Aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacons dress got in by his	51.661502838134766
7639/28840	The carriage stopped at the door of the	10.270197868347168
7640/28840	It was about nine oclock in the	10.535843849182129
7641/28840	The anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by	128.62249755859375
7642/28840	The king was already sanguine but when he perceived Aramis his hope turned to	82.98471069335938
7643/28840	He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aram	22.090469360351562
7644/28840	The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous	99.38274383544922
7645/28840	The king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same	234.1236114501953
7646/28840	Juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the	90.35049438476562
7647/28840	As soon as the door was closed   Sire said Aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the London executioner has	41.22499465942383
7648/28840	His assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we heard was hisand there is no executioner nearer at hand than	207.34083557128906
7649/28840	But the Comte de la Fere asked the	8.795005798339844
7650/28840	Two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the	86.25798797607422
7651/28840	The king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the	75.9826431274414
7652/28840	So said Charles he who knocks down there   Is the Comte de la Fere sire said Aram	17.65639877319336
7653/28840	He is preparing a way for your majesty to	46.236602783203125
7654/28840	Parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be	223.95960998535156
7655/28840	Sire replied Juxon you shall be ob	63.53168869018555
7656/28840	Meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the	56.03591537475586
7657/28840	Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and	52.9505500793457
7658/28840	It was that of a number of men steadily	56.12330627441406
7659/28840	All eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemn	21.933231353759766
7660/28840	A parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their	174.5237274169922
7661/28840	What is this said Aramis to Jux	25.5169734954834
7662/28840	Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about	56.31610870361328
7663/28840	Then it is for today asked the	86.57168579101562
7664/28840	Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning   Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London executioner   The London executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services	40.23023986816406
7665/28840	The execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal	75.61557006835938
7666/28840	A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles evinced as he learned these tid	49.630775451660156
7667/28840	His heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the	44.774200439453125
7668/28840	Charles perceived it and took his	94.32544708251953
7669/28840	There is but little reason why I should delay	58.6372184753418
7670/28840	Firstly I wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last	52.85362243652344
7671/28840	Will this be permitted me   Certainly replied the officer and left the	69.60314178466797
7672/28840	Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned	65.47383880615234
7673/28840	Oh my lord bishop he cried seizing Juxons hands where is Providence where is Providence   My son replied the bishop with firmness you see Him not because the passions of the world conceal	59.05421447753906
7674/28840	My son said the king to Aramis do not take it so to	48.110172271728516
7675/28840	God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their	93.57127380371094
7676/28840	Ascribe to men then what is happening and not to	386.7365417480469
7677/28840	It is men who drive me to death it is men who make you	96.50357818603516
7678/28840	Yes sire said Aramis yes you are	19.80010223388672
7679/28840	It is men whom I should hold responsible and I will hold them	70.9798355102539
7680/28840	Be seated Juxon said the king falling upon his	30.860116958618164
7681/28840	I have now to confess to	35.6194953918457
7682/28840	Remain sir he added to Aramis who had moved to leave the	77.60002899169922
7683/28840	I have nothing to say that cannot be said before	35.254390716552734
7684/28840	Juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his	152.06175231933594
7685/28840	Remember     The mob had already assembled when the confession	68.07864379882812
7686/28840	The kings children next arrivedthe Princess Charlotte a beautiful fairhaired child with tears in her eyes and the Duke of Gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing	65.15663146972656
7687/28840	He had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the	168.6263885498047
7688/28840	Charless heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of	26.707395553588867
7689/28840	He turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and	97.55745697021484
7690/28840	Then he took the boy upon his	63.97150421142578
7691/28840	My son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came	37.61346435546875
7692/28840	These men are going to behead your	109.58088684082031
7693/28840	Perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York your elder	47.895286560058594
7694/28840	But you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are	47.54695510864258
7695/28840	Swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the	93.08570861816406
7696/28840	For one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as I	58.09900665283203
7697/28840	The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said I swear to your	34.203861236572266
7698/28840	Henry said Charles call me your	185.67514038085938
7699/28840	Father replied the child I swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me	58.35305404663086
7700/28840	Now kiss me and you too	293.762939453125
7701/28840	Oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers	149.6577911376953
7702/28840	Take them away Juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to	65.20333862304688
7703/28840	Juxon led them away and this time the doors were left	78.68982696533203
7704/28840	Meanwhile Athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his	81.02828216552734
7705/28840	Two long hours he waited in terrible	220.35153198242188
7706/28840	A deathlike silence reigned in the room	62.891605377197266
7707/28840	At last he determined to discover the cause of this still	92.21082305908203
7708/28840	He crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaff	64.48701477050781
7709/28840	Peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the	28.051605224609375
7710/28840	What is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed cloth he was holding	48.81266403198242
7711/28840	The people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators I see DArtagn	25.475406646728516
7712/28840	What is he waiting for What is he looking at Good God have they allowed the headsman to escape   Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the	59.511165618896484
7713/28840	The sound of heavy steps was heard above his	185.1963348388672
7714/28840	The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then	53.85575485229492
7715/28840	At the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words   Colonel I want to speak to the	41.571746826171875
7716/28840	It was the king speaking on the scaff	58.67586898803711
7717/28840	In fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread Charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for	60.00743865966797
7718/28840	Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the execution	40.42854690551758
7719/28840	He approached the block and laid his axe upon	220.5681915283203
7720/28840	Behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was Charles Stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaff	60.163475036621094
7721/28840	The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged	88.70741271972656
7722/28840	Every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following	65.45370483398438
7723/28840	But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his	51.06505584716797
7724/28840	The kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of Athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the	67.97601318359375
7725/28840	Do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his	105.4412612915039
7726/28840	At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the	77.09066009521484
7727/28840	Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Jux	33.8022346496582
7728/28840	Then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of Henrietta	58.65327072143555
7729/28840	Sir said he to the priest I shall keep this cross in my hand till the last	30.256826400756836
7730/28840	Take it from me when I am	60.32659149169922
7731/28840	Yes sire said a voice which Athos recognized as that of Aram	21.85021209716797
7732/28840	He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the	15.09390640258789
7733/28840	One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his	29.26679801940918
7734/28840	Then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to	42.72325134277344
7735/28840	All the preparations were made with a frightful calm	79.92664337158203
7736/28840	One would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his	50.21749496459961
7737/28840	Will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied	81.38587951660156
7738/28840	Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown heads	62.48948287963867
7739/28840	His calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his	71.28064727783203
7740/28840	But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aram	35.22726058959961
7741/28840	The king seeing that he did not reply repeated his	81.69979095458984
7742/28840	It will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the	49.43255615234375
7743/28840	The king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said   This block is very low is there no other to be had   It is the usual block answered the man in the	36.406585693359375
7744/28840	Do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the	37.21586608886719
7745/28840	There was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shudd	112.09578704833984
7746/28840	I do not wish to be taken by surprise added the	33.648414611816406
7747/28840	I shall kneel down to pray do not strike	141.72586059570312
7748/28840	When shall I strike   When I shall lay my head on the block and say Remember then strike	71.80474853515625
7749/28840	Gentlemen said the king to those around him I leave you to brave the tempest I go before you to a kingdom which knows no	127.95075988769531
7750/28840	He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his	16.14540672302246
7751/28840	Now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer I beseech	53.06184005737305
7752/28840	You also stand aside he said to the masked	166.56236267089844
7753/28840	It is only for a moment and I know that I belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till I give the	25.168947219848633
7754/28840	Then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in French Comte de la Fere are you there   Yes your majesty he answered	22.8725528717041
7755/28840	Faithful friend noble heart said the king I should not have been	103.92764282226562
7756/28840	I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God last of all I speak to	56.7705192565918
7757/28840	To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have lost the throne and my children their	215.9958953857422
7758/28840	A million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of Newcastle	171.2669219970703
7759/28840	You only know that this money	137.43479919433594
7760/28840	Make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons	45.35249710083008
7761/28840	Farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped Athos chilled with	127.04539489746094
7762/28840	A moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed Remember   He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his	47.157833099365234
7763/28840	He reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson catar	96.38056182861328
7764/28840	Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or	40.13679885864258
7765/28840	At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred	49.842620849609375
7766/28840	Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the	27.146020889282227
7767/28840	Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarchs blood fell down ins	38.4814338684082
7768/28840	The snow was falling thick and	294.3133850097656
7769/28840	Aramis was the next to come in and to discover Athos almost ins	31.622318267822266
7770/28840	But at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had	26.252254486083984
7771/28840	Well said Aramis beaten by fate   Beaten said Ath	49.85520935058594
7772/28840	Noble and unhappy king   Are you wounded cried Aram	49.494991302490234
7773/28840	Where were you then   Where you left meunder the scaff	57.92633819580078
7774/28840	Did you see it all   No but I heard	29.48310661315918
7775/28840	God preserve me from another such hour as I have just	97.85343933105469
7776/28840	Then you know that I did not leave him   I heard your voice up to the last	30.465408325195312
7777/28840	Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the	87.37057495117188
7778/28840	Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied Athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the kings	46.24204635620117
7779/28840	And what he continued has been done with the poor body   By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to	57.26152420043945
7780/28840	The doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted	91.35738372802734
7781/28840	Mockery muttered Athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered   Well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which Porthos had just	81.29380798339844
7782/28840	We are all mortal my poor	82.72888946533203
7783/28840	Yes there were some people on the way who delayed	80.92784881591797
7784/28840	I took one of them by the throat and threequarters throttled	55.634849548339844
7785/28840	Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so I took advantage of his silence to walk	79.33218383789062
7786/28840	Have you seen DArtagnan   We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him	42.3315544128418
7787/28840	Oh said Athos satirically I saw	31.9797420501709
7788/28840	He was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the	85.29594421386719
7789/28840	They were anxious about you here I simply told them where you	192.59841918945312
7790/28840	You didnt know King Charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love	45.37348175048828
7791/28840	So saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his	39.054039001464844
7792/28840	Ugh I am tired cried DArtagnan sitting	77.6379623413086
7793/28840	Drink a glass of port said Aramis it will refresh	114.69049835205078
7794/28840	Yes let us drink said Athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with DArtagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful	26.64764976501465
7795/28840	The felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave tonight we have nothing more to do	32.13737869262695
7796/28840	You are in a hurry sir count said DArtagn	19.575305938720703
7797/28840	Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his	157.21560668945312
7798/28840	Ah you remain in London said Porth	36.967864990234375
7799/28840	And you   Hang it said Porthos a little perplexed between the two I suppose as I came with you I must go away with	31.351472854614258
7800/28840	I cant leave you alone in this abominable	51.40807342529297
7801/28840	So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is	26.968162536621094
7802/28840	I want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the kings	59.44891357421875
7803/28840	A man in a mask cried Ath	69.85803985595703
7804/28840	You did not let the executioner escape then   The executioner is still in the cellar where I presume he has had an interview with mine hosts	42.89139938354492
7805/28840	Mousqueton   Sir answered a voice from the depths of the	20.803264617919922
7806/28840	But said Athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king   An amateur headsman replied Aramis who however does not handle the axe am	40.69844436645508
7807/28840	Did you not see his face asked Ath	68.42097473144531
7808/28840	But you Aramis who were close to him   I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the	25.687030792236328
7809/28840	Then it must be a man of a certain	32.33782958984375
7810/28840	When one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under	45.021854400634766
7811/28840	I am sorry I did not follow him said Porth	20.620153427124023
7812/28840	Well my dear Porthos said DArtagnan thats the very thing it came into my head to	20.608049392700195
7813/28840	I have distrusted God I could the more easily distrust	150.56597900390625
7814/28840	We will see about that presently said DArtagnan with a slight	20.17860221862793
7815/28840	I was looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black	77.7172622680664
7816/28840	Humph thought I that looks like my handiwork I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or	307.5033874511719
7817/28840	And in fact it was that unfortunate Scotchman Parrys brother you know on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his	55.310874938964844
7818/28840	Well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around I recognized the honest Grim	97.8511962890625
7819/28840	Grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the	154.48526000976562
7820/28840	Eh said he which meant Do you see him Parbleu I answered and we perfectly understood one	117.44691467285156
7821/28840	Well everything was finished as you	109.76810455322266
7822/28840	I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the	21.827823638916016
7823/28840	I saw the executioner return into the kings room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and	50.21033477783203
7824/28840	Five minutes later he came down the grand	245.0371856689453
7825/28840	I should think so but not without	66.48371887207031
7826/28840	Every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal	117.48103332519531
7827/28840	I might have gone up to him and killed	34.056304931640625
7828/28840	But I am not selfish and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the	37.42745590209961
7829/28840	So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hours time he stopped before a little isolated	41.53390121459961
7830/28840	The man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being	32.465023040771484
7831/28840	Grimaud and I got behind a tree and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the	96.88215637207031
7832/28840	Next moment the door opened and the man	33.676727294921875
7833/28840	While you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find	46.975284576416016
7834/28840	Come now Aramis said DArtagnan you must be taking me for some one	27.187732696533203
7835/28840	Nevertheless said Athos in your absence   Well in my absence havent I put in my place Grimaud and the Scotchman Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined the house on all	40.808170318603516
7836/28840	At one of the doors that by which he had entered I placed our Scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out	33.514644622802734
7837/28840	Then going around the house I placed Grimaud at the other exit and here I	73.86347198486328
7838/28840	Friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me I was wrong a hundred times	41.24509048461914
7839/28840	I ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us	54.445396423339844
7840/28840	Dont you think the executioner might be Master Cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself   Ah just	45.959815979003906
7841/28840	Cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than	141.78932189941406
7842/28840	Some condemned soldier perhaps suggested Athos whom they have pardoned at the price of reg	164.18692016601562
7843/28840	No no continued DArtagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horse	39.75209045410156
7844/28840	If I am not mistaken we have to do with a	19.744606018066406
7845/28840	Impossible It would be a dishonor to all the	98.0616226196289
7846/28840	Fine sport by Jove cried Porthos with a laugh that shook the	35.2679443359375
7847/28840	Fine sport   Are you still bent on departure Athos asked DArtagn	41.65045928955078
7848/28840	No I remain replied Athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was	53.38838195800781
7849/28840	Swords then cried Aramis swords let us not lose a	112.83858489990234
7850/28840	The four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their	37.64825439453125
7851/28840	The night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and	215.0463104248047
7852/28840	DArtagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in	20.605493545532227
7853/28840	For a moment DArtagnan thought that Parrys brother had disappeared but he was	31.731191635131836
7854/28840	The robust Scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover	73.56350708007812
7855/28840	Come said Athos heres another good	60.1987419128418
7856/28840	Really honest men are not so scarce as I	77.35316467285156
7857/28840	Dont be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotch	49.788429260253906
7858/28840	I believe the fellow is here on his own account for I have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the Tweed are very vind	45.76478576660156
7859/28840	I should not like to be Groslow if he meets	29.719375610351562
7860/28840	Well said Athos to the man in	25.23125648498535
7861/28840	No one has come out he	197.18109130859375
7862/28840	Well has anybody come out   No but somebody has gone	67.03398132324219
7863/28840	A man or a woman   A	54.80366134643555
7864/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan there are two of them then   I wish there were four said Athos the two parties would then be	24.268869400024414
7865/28840	What do you mean   Other men may have entered before them and waited for	40.46302795410156
7866/28840	At the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light	30.57613182067871
7867/28840	That is true said DArtagnan let us call the	20.11133575439453
7868/28840	They returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aram	25.020984649658203
7869/28840	No but we are going to replied DArtagnan pointing to Grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the	16.860769271850586
7870/28840	Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when	142.7356414794922
7871/28840	Then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was	82.17488861083984
7872/28840	Grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread	532.880859375
7873/28840	Speak said Athos we cannot see your	143.31362915039062
7874/28840	How many are there  	108.12310791015625
7875/28840	One opposite to me the other with his back to	54.19468307495117
7876/28840	And the man opposite to you is   The man I saw go	89.79193878173828
7877/28840	Do you know him   I thought I recognized him and was not	17.627704620361328
7878/28840	Who is it they all asked together in a low	47.29082489013672
7879/28840	The four friends looked at one	58.77348709106445
7880/28840	The executioner said DArtagnan and Aramis at the same	8.189919471740723
7881/28840	I can see nothing but his back resumed Grim	80.90716552734375
7882/28840	He is moving and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to	24.392642974853516
7883/28840	Ah   And as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a gro	47.41458511352539
7884/28840	Did you see him they all	184.67832946777344
7885/28840	Yes said Grimaud with his hair standing on	43.01126480102539
7886/28840	The thin spare man  	107.16011047363281
7887/28840	Heheis murmured Grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his masters	62.9834098815918
7888/28840	DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of	4.577616214752197
7889/28840	Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his	15.86436653137207
7890/28840	It was in fact Mordaunt whom DArtagnan had followed without knowing	28.386045455932617
7891/28840	On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a	49.59074783325195
7892/28840	Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London unknown except to the most intimate of his	59.78561019897461
7893/28840	General I wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed	49.972625732421875
7894/28840	Ah I scarcely thought you were so curious as	78.70520782470703
7895/28840	I am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of	50.75131607055664
7896/28840	But you general were you not at Whitehall   No said Crom	37.90441131591797
7897/28840	Have you had any account of it  	42.65617752075195
7898/28840	I have been here since the	16.09230613708496
7899/28840	I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the	34.54529571533203
7900/28840	Four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich where a vessel was	45.20364761352539
7901/28840	And knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and	165.17337036132812
7902/28840	But who told you I was inactive   Butif the plot had succeeded   I wished it to do	41.2376823425293
7903/28840	I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles	77.02408599853516
7904/28840	as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of	116.78376007080078
7905/28840	Yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaff	83.56787109375
7906/28840	Because it could have been said that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of	48.258541107177734
7907/28840	But if he had escaped   Impossible my precautions were	74.73072814941406
7908/28840	And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him   The four Frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by Mazarin to	41.16166687011719
7909/28840	And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done   It is	21.531099319458008
7910/28840	How so   Because they	72.96973419189453
7911/28840	Your honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for Charles	47.84800338745117
7912/28840	Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against England will your honor give me all four of them   Take them said Crom	45.645240783691406
7913/28840	Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant fer	99.0648422241211
7914/28840	Did the people shout at all Cromwell	173.6203155517578
7915/28840	Very little except Long live Cromwell   Where were you placed   Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew	50.12815856933594
7916/28840	But his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwell	55.239444732666016
7917/28840	I was so situated as to hear and see everything he	97.02547454833984
7918/28840	It was now Cromwells turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt and Mordaunt to make himself impenetr	25.63921356201172
7919/28840	It appears said Cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably	53.51791763305664
7920/28840	The blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters	126.11486053466797
7921/28840	Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or	60.62753677368164
7922/28840	In fact said Mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow suffic	27.17682647705078
7923/28840	Perhaps it was some one in that occupation said Crom	57.907310485839844
7924/28840	Do you think so sir He did not look like an execution	39.35415267944336
7925/28840	And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office   But said Mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this	42.449459075927734
7926/28840	And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action   It is not for me to	48.86678695678711
7927/28840	It rests between his conscience and his	326.4048156738281
7928/28840	But if your honor knew this man   I neither know nor wish to know	33.8472900390625
7929/28840	Provided Charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must	297.5507507324219
7930/28840	And yet without the man the king would have been	88.78142547607422
7931/28840	They would have carried him to Greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the	59.97577667236328
7932/28840	Once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest Mord	65.3455581665039
7933/28840	Yes they would have all been blown	57.058902740478516
7934/28840	The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to	70.8280029296875
7935/28840	Men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by	59.538387298583984
7936/28840	You see now why I did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions I could not thank him for what he has	60.56503677368164
7937/28840	Sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was	44.67733383178711
7938/28840	Say absurd since it has become	410.79705810546875
7939/28840	The only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear	178.88417053222656
7940/28840	So tonight Mordaunt go to Greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca	43.73938751220703
7941/28840	Oh my lord my lord   That title said Cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in	47.03941345214844
7942/28840	But your honor will soon be called so	127.8133773803711
7943/28840	I hope so at least said Cromwell rising and putting on his	24.499004364013672
7944/28840	You are going sir   Yes said Crom	20.50092887878418
7945/28840	I slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same	47.92450714111328
7946/28840	Then said Mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for tonight   And even for all day tomorrow if you want	56.85807800292969
7947/28840	Since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that I should give you	45.10022735595703
7948/28840	Thank you sir it will be well employed I	104.83659362792969
7949/28840	And no one waiting for you outside  	53.99727249145508
7950/28840	Then you had better come with	50.28733444213867
7951/28840	Thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to	66.75154113769531
7952/28840	Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered	23.53424644470215
7953/28840	It closed after him with a	39.18315887451172
7954/28840	This door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future	25.2596378326416
7955/28840	It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated	60.945796966552734
7956/28840	DArtagnan was the first to recover from his	12.32495403289795
7957/28840	Ah by Heaven it is God Himself who sent us	111.15632629394531
7958/28840	Yes said Porthos let us break the door in and fall upon	23.77730369567871
7959/28840	Now Grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to	32.541324615478516
7960/28840	If he comes out we shall catch	80.45980834960938
7961/28840	If he stays in we will break in the	213.93753051757812
7962/28840	It is easier and less noisy than the	76.76705169677734
7963/28840	Grimaud began to scale the wall	445.52154541015625
7964/28840	Keep guard at the other door Athos and Aram	23.314428329467773
7965/28840	We did not see his companion come	54.938411712646484
7966/28840	He may have gone by the other	69.15326690673828
7967/28840	What is he doing   Putting on his cloak and	47.40624237060547
7968/28840	Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabb	27.634014129638672
7969/28840	Put it up again my friend said DArtagn	24.771059036254883
7970/28840	We must proceed in an orderly	94.62966918945312
7971/28840	Hush said Grimaud he is coming	90.49488830566406
7972/28840	He has put out the lamp I can see nothing	118.08556365966797
7973/28840	The snow deadened the noise of his	291.048095703125
7974/28840	Now go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch	24.758583068847656
7975/28840	The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with DArtagn	17.443546295166016
7976/28840	Porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running	49.98735427856445
7977/28840	Mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for	265.34967041015625
7978/28840	DArtagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no	58.292423248291016
7979/28840	At last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before Mordaunt had been talking to Crom	80.00363159179688
7980/28840	Porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the	67.5925064086914
7981/28840	Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door behind	25.188108444213867
7982/28840	Oblige me by taking a seat said DArtagnan pushing a chair toward Mordaunt who sat down pale but	89.41142272949219
7983/28840	Aramis Porthos and DArtagnan drew their chairs near	13.821732521057129
7984/28840	Athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the	45.15610885620117
7985/28840	Porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impat	28.98544692993164
7986/28840	Aramis bit his lips till the blood	29.445375442504883
7987/28840	DArtagnan alone was calm at least in	47.70260238647461
7988/28840	Monsieur Mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you	40.33251190185547
7989/28840	Though Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of	61.7919807434082
7990/28840	His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right	80.0609130859375
7991/28840	DArtagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said	26.394304275512695
7992/28840	Aramis muttered to himself We shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace	68.23106384277344
7993/28840	Porthos sucked his mustache muttering A good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an add	141.0572509765625
7994/28840	Athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrel	59.52385330200195
7995/28840	The silence however could not last	1087.2734375
7996/28840	Just now DArtagnan continued you were disguisedI mean to say attiredas a murderer and now   And now I look very much like a man who is going to be	42.44933319091797
7997/28840	Oh sir said DArtagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side   No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and dag	33.52700424194336
7998/28840	I had the honor of asking you why you altered your	56.385379791259766
7999/28840	The mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this	61.47226333618164
8000/28840	Why then have you laid it aside   Because remembering the scene at Armentieres I thought I should find four axes for one as I was to meet four execution	45.9119873046875
8001/28840	Sir replied DArtagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young I shall therefore overlook your frivolous	31.342653274536133
8002/28840	What took place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present	55.29460144042969
8003/28840	We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight	110.88617706298828
8004/28840	Aha It is a duel then cried Mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the	74.21924591064453
8005/28840	Porthos rose always ready for this kind of	86.8244857788086
8006/28840	Do not let us do things in a	62.405033111572266
8007/28840	We will arrange the matter rather	375.276611328125
8008/28840	Confess Monsieur Mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of	32.02506637573242
8009/28840	Then my dear sir I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you	42.241573333740234
8010/28840	Of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof I can furnish is this   So saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French	57.205711364746094
8011/28840	My sword is shorter than yours its true but bah I think the arm will make up for the	160.12754821777344
8012/28840	He might have been taken for a	39.024105072021484
8013/28840	Even his breathing seemed to be	164.72219848632812
8014/28840	Gentlemen said DArtagnan you shall have your	70.19291687011719
8015/28840	Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you	48.79655838012695
8016/28840	You can see it in his	190.14474487304688
8017/28840	So pray keep your places like Athos whose calmness is entirely laud	86.50495910644531
8018/28840	Besides we will have no words about	73.656982421875
8019/28840	I have particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will	69.54303741455078
8020/28840	Porthos and Aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword DArtagnan turned to his adversary   Sir I am waiting for	15.262065887451172
8021/28840	And for my part gentlemen I admire	87.38040924072266
8022/28840	You are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the	77.74353790283203
8023/28840	I hate you all but not	232.25888061523438
8024/28840	I hope to kill all four of you but I am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the	47.78997039794922
8025/28840	I claim then the right to choose my	307.228271484375
8026/28840	If you refuse this right you may kill me but I shall not	64.27163696289062
8027/28840	It is but fair said Porthos and Aramis hoping he would choose one of	28.427270889282227
8028/28840	Athos and DArtagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply	32.41529083251953
8029/28840	Well then said Mordaunt I choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called Comte de la Fere calls himself Ath	38.135887145996094
8030/28840	Athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends Monsieur Mordaunt a duel between us is	35.04413986206055
8031/28840	Ah said Mordaunt with a sneer theres one who is	19.07225227355957
8032/28840	Zounds exclaimed DArtagnan bounding toward him who says that Athos is afraid   Let him have his say DArtagnan said Athos with a smile of sadness and	22.997159957885742
8033/28840	Is it your decision Athos resumed the Gas	79.2931137084961
8034/28840	You hear sir said DArtagnan turning to Mord	16.545528411865234
8035/28840	The Comte de la Fere will not do you the honor of fighting with	14.58670425415039
8036/28840	Choose one of us to replace the Comte de la F	12.864673614501953
8037/28840	As long as I dont fight with him it is the same to me with whom I	53.30287551879883
8038/28840	Put your names into a hat and draw	242.24270629882812
8039/28840	At least that will conciliate us all said Aram	54.453758239746094
8040/28840	I should never have thought of that said Porthos and yet it is very	16.265491485595703
8041/28840	Come Aramis said DArtagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of	44.39045715332031
8042/28840	Mordaunt sustained this new attack without win	586.3895874023438
8043/28840	He stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such	62.66156005859375
8044/28840	If he had not courage he had what is very like it namely	241.9710693359375
8045/28840	He then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to Mord	51.13603973388672
8046/28840	Mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading	71.06914520263672
8047/28840	Ah serpent muttered DArtagnan I would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my	52.496864318847656
8048/28840	Aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read DArtagn	37.914390563964844
8049/28840	The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt   I hope sir said he you have no objection to	10.765069007873535
8050/28840	None whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his	108.40389251708984
8051/28840	The moment that DArtagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquill	31.72099494934082
8052/28840	He turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him in a singular	62.58747482299805
8053/28840	Are you ready sir he said at	107.47815704345703
8054/28840	I was waiting for you sir said Mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to	25.48919105529785
8055/28840	Well then said the Gascon take care of yourself for I am not a bad hand at the rap	26.81336212158203
8056/28840	So much the better that sets my mind at	51.3361930847168
8057/28840	Give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the	46.194740295410156
8058/28840	Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper   No but to set my mind at rest as you observed just	66.47380065917969
8059/28840	It is for something else than that I imagine muttered DArtagnan shaking his head doubt	22.254182815551758
8060/28840	On the honor of gentlemen said Aramis and Porth	16.164039611816406
8061/28840	In that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample	88.75894165039062
8062/28840	Yes gentlemen said DArtagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect I fancy he is anxious still to	42.80254364013672
8063/28840	This new attack made no impression on Mord	79.92664337158203
8064/28840	The space was cleared the two lamps placed on Cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords	70.24739074707031
8065/28840	DArtagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his	30.442609786987305
8066/28840	He made a rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt par	149.7965087890625
8067/28840	Aha he cried with a smile of	63.111480712890625
8068/28840	And without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding	82.48887634277344
8069/28840	This time it was Mordaunt who	62.064273834228516
8070/28840	Ah sir said DArtagnan you have a wicked	11.597103118896484
8071/28840	Ah you lose ground you are turning Well as you please I even gain something by it for I no longer see that wicked smile of	137.86412048339844
8072/28840	You have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are	108.49211883544922
8073/28840	Look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown youa frank and honorable count	65.05836486816406
8074/28840	To this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of DArtagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponents attention Mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with DArtagn	46.96876525878906
8075/28840	He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon	49.483238220214844
8076/28840	Come come cried DArtagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a	61.38172149658203
8077/28840	However as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever Mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left	66.72900390625
8078/28840	Ah this time you cannot lose ground my fine friend exclaimed DArtagn	53.68557357788086
8079/28840	Gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall	177.58554077148438
8080/28840	Well then you shall see it	44.99789047241211
8081/28840	In a second DArtagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked	58.70268630981445
8082/28840	The three friends looked on panting and	113.7425765991211
8083/28840	DArtagnan sprang back the wall had closed	46.06251525878906
8084/28840	Mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which Cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and	78.41100311279297
8085/28840	The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron	30.422264099121094
8086/28840	Help me gentlemen cried DArtagnan we must break in this	36.92787170410156
8087/28840	It is the devil in person said Aramis hastening	61.85887145996094
8088/28840	He escapes us growled Porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in	89.37906646728516
8089/28840	I thought as much said DArtagnan wasting his strength in useless	44.99984359741211
8090/28840	Zounds I thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the	147.76406860351562
8091/28840	I thought he was up to	198.4269561767578
8092/28840	Its a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said Aram	39.0102653503418
8093/28840	Its a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven said Athos evidently much	84.47746276855469
8094/28840	Really said DArtagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts Athos I cannot imagine how you can talk to us in that	37.521949768066406
8095/28840	You cannot understand the position we are	93.39778137207031
8096/28840	In this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be	108.14228820800781
8097/28840	This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred ironsided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this	93.92357635498047
8098/28840	If we stay here five minutes more theres an end of	56.24531173706055
8099/28840	But where shall we go asked Porth	24.84627342224121
8100/28840	To the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please God to France where at least I understand the architecture of the	81.72791290283203
8101/28840	So suiting the action to the word DArtagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the	23.18199348449707
8102/28840	DArtagnan had judged correctly Mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost	27.85574722290039
8103/28840	He knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to	86.17350769042969
8104/28840	This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of	42.0159797668457
8105/28840	After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take	68.54695892333984
8106/28840	Good he said nothing almost nothingscratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the	115.67427062988281
8107/28840	The wounds that I make are better than thatwitness the executioner of Bethune my uncle and King	49.24970245361328
8108/28840	Now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save	98.48176574707031
8109/28840	They must diedie all togetherkilled at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of	340.6483154296875
8110/28840	I will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they	54.66598129272461
8111/28840	Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league	57.19264602661133
8112/28840	He made that quarter of a league in four or five	25.116436004638672
8113/28840	Arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high	118.7354507446289
8114/28840	A quarter of an hour later he was at	27.00813865661621
8115/28840	That dark point yonder is the Isle of	182.26072692871094
8116/28840	Good I am half an hour in advance of them an hour	60.8563232421875
8117/28840	Fool that I was I have almost killed myself by my needless	165.1168212890625
8118/28840	Now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which I wonder is the Lightning   At this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward	29.749292373657227
8119/28840	Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to	41.527496337890625
8120/28840	He was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his	53.73208236694336
8121/28840	Do you wish to go on the water sir said the	47.4437255859375
8122/28840	And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than	117.92289733886719
8123/28840	You would like one that sails as rapidly as   Lightning interrupted Mord	109.89521789550781
8124/28840	Then mine is the boat you want	228.4274444580078
8125/28840	I begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain	65.45551300048828
8126/28840	Here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each	31.771881103515625
8127/28840	Good quite right cried Mordaunt springing off his	54.497928619384766
8128/28840	Theres not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your	53.452919006347656
8129/28840	But asked the sailor where are your companions I thought there were four of	70.79585266113281
8130/28840	Im not the man you take me for you are in Captain Rogerss post are you not under orders from General Crom	67.2291488647461
8131/28840	Mine also are from him   Indeed sir I recognize you you are Captain Mord	64.10543060302734
8132/28840	Oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his	200.56787109375
8133/28840	The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this	57.38583755493164
8134/28840	Is there anything new in the wind  	89.62438201904297
8135/28840	I thought perhaps that the kings death   Has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be	72.88394927978516
8136/28840	What have you come for then   To embark with	46.886016845703125
8137/28840	Ah ah the general doubted my fidelity   No but I wish to have a share in my	56.4871826171875
8138/28840	Havent you some one who will relieve me of my horse   Groslow whistled and a sailor	69.02886199951172
8139/28840	Patrick said Groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest	23.2546329498291
8140/28840	If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish	108.44168090820312
8141/28840	Now said Mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you   There is no danger dressed as I am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as	44.556968688964844
8142/28840	Besides even you didnt recognize me they will be much less likely	77.20646667480469
8143/28840	That is true said Mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of	40.16569900512695
8144/28840	Everything is ready is it not  	35.02001190185547
8145/28840	The cargo on board  	56.47815704345703
8146/28840	Five full casks   And fifty empty	245.53663635253906
8147/28840	We are carrying port wine to An	374.8895568847656
8148/28840	Now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be	58.592166900634766
8149/28840	It is important that none of your crew should see	63.91131591796875
8150/28840	I have but one man on board and I am as sure of him as I am of	18.39958381652832
8151/28840	Besides he doesnt know you like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our	96.3950424194336
8152/28840	They then went down to the	29.433744430541992
8153/28840	A boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a	68.91950225830078
8154/28840	Groslow jumped in followed by Mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of London and Mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of	51.611385345458984
8155/28840	When they reached the side of this felucca Mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among lands	44.51414108276367
8156/28840	He went with Groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the	30.242021560668945
8157/28840	They will have nothing to do then at this end said Mord	42.720584869384766
8158/28840	Return to Greenwich and bring them	90.44247436523438
8159/28840	I shall hide myself in your	59.2000617980957
8160/28840	You have a longboat   That in which we	51.512447357177734
8161/28840	Fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the	81.81491088867188
8162/28840	Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves	42.716121673583984
8163/28840	Do you wish to see the powderroom  	25.696378707885742
8164/28840	When you return I will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by	85.51577758789062
8165/28840	Groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached	95.28267669677734
8166/28840	The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved	39.980350494384766
8167/28840	These horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of DArtagnan and Ath	46.40294647216797
8168/28840	As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they	46.23655700683594
8169/28840	Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst DArtagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watch	37.174232482910156
8170/28840	On seeing the appointed signal Groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the	50.50374221801758
8171/28840	What do you want with us he asked of Gros	26.56521987915039
8172/28840	I wish to inform you my lord replied Groslow with an Irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find	24.061506271362305
8173/28840	He fell down this morning and broke his	117.10641479492188
8174/28840	Was that all he said inquired Ath	70.56741333007812
8175/28840	No my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port you choose in	49.72182846069336
8176/28840	What do you think of all this said Athos in a low tone to DArtagnan after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in	19.976625442504883
8177/28840	It seems a likely story to	130.84812927246094
8178/28840	Besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the Gascon and you Athos you know something of everything and can be our	62.89247512817383
8179/28840	I dare say you know how to navigate should he fail	54.880645751953125
8180/28840	My father meant me for the navy and I have some vague notions about	93.33656311035156
8181/28840	Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and	76.3639144897461
8182/28840	Parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to France but he had straightway	245.99752807617188
8183/28840	It is very simple Mousqueton had said he is thinking of Gros	53.63337707519531
8184/28840	It was Captain Groslow the reader will remember who had broken Parrys	80.12725067138672
8185/28840	DArtagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with	98.6456069946289
8186/28840	He found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too	187.47265625
8187/28840	He had reported to Aramis what had taken place and Aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his	58.80897903442383
8188/28840	A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascons uneas	80.53899383544922
8189/28840	We have no time now for suspicions said Ath	76.41199493408203
8190/28840	The boat is waiting for us	82.30174255371094
8191/28840	Besides said Aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time We can watch the sk	51.75385284423828
8192/28840	And if he doesnt go straight I will crush him thats	95.68128967285156
8193/28840	You first Mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the	39.44573974609375
8194/28840	Athos followed them then Porthos then Aram	56.449832916259766
8195/28840	DArtagnan went last still shaking his	35.540103912353516
8196/28840	What in the devil is the matter with you my friend said Porth	13.221330642700195
8197/28840	Upon my word you would make Caesar	192.9514923095703
8198/28840	The matter is replied DArtagnan that I can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor excis	63.051170349121094
8199/28840	And you complain of that said Porth	29.425312042236328
8200/28840	Everything goes as if in flowery	163.8397674560547
8201/28840	But no matter we must trust in	175.22677612304688
8202/28840	As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boathook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were	48.32863998413086
8203/28840	The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to	73.5136489868164
8204/28840	As soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more	110.07347106933594
8205/28840	At last we are off exclaimed Porth	65.4346694946289
8206/28840	Yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a	86.15752410888672
8207/28840	We are not yet at our destination observed the prudent DArtagnan beware of misad	37.733184814453125
8208/28840	Ah my friend cried Porthos like the crows you always bring bad om	58.28000259399414
8209/28840	Who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one   Yes but tomorrow morning   Tomorrow we shall be at Boulog	38.30303955078125
8210/28840	I hope so with all my heart said the Gascon and I confess my	32.29825973510742
8211/28840	Yes Athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush	42.67524337768555
8212/28840	But said Porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the	32.442176818847656
8213/28840	You dont imagine he would consider a little thing like that   At any rate said Porthos I am glad to hear DArtagnan admit that he is	23.144424438476562
8214/28840	I not only confess it but am proud of it returned the Gascon Im not such a rhinoceros as you	51.2869758605957
8215/28840	Oho whats that   The Lightning answered the captain our felu	54.36928176879883
8216/28840	They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for thema cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some	47.37847900390625
8217/28840	Stop a moment cried DArtagnan pray how many men have you on board captain   I dont understand was the	25.88103485107422
8218/28840	Groslow on the question being interpreted answered Three without counting	547.8928833007812
8219/28840	DArtagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three	166.3196563720703
8220/28840	Oh he exclaimed I begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves I shall make the round of the	100.8311767578125
8221/28840	As for me said Porthos I will see to the	24.977510452270508
8222/28840	A very good idea Porthos said the Gas	49.65377426147461
8223/28840	Athos lend me Grimaud who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little English and can act as my	54.34381866455078
8224/28840	DArtagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in English Come being with the classic English oath the only English words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower	65.600341796875
8225/28840	Oho cried DArtagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of Ali Bab	38.93783187866211
8226/28840	What is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the cas	55.59687042236328
8227/28840	The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered   Port	154.08900451660156
8228/28840	Ah port wine tis a comfort said the Gascon since we shall not die of	43.74375915527344
8229/28840	Are they all full   Grimaud translated the question and Groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered   Some full others	57.01957321166992
8230/28840	Stop said the Englishman I have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing	20.566986083984375
8231/28840	Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third	99.17998504638672
8232/28840	This was the room appropriated to the	74.3040542602539
8233/28840	Two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire	86.96478271484375
8234/28840	DArtagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the	49.53946304321289
8235/28840	And this room he asked pointing to the captains	63.52293395996094
8236/28840	DArtagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed   Good he	33.378273010253906
8237/28840	If there is an army on board it is not here that it is	63.406455993652344
8238/28840	Let us see what Porthos has found for	74.32074737548828
8239/28840	And thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends	163.8799285888672
8240/28840	Porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over	128.37684631347656
8241/28840	He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when DArtagnan	23.727659225463867
8242/28840	Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in	53.816776275634766

8245/28840	Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a val	56.799598693847656
8246/28840	On a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three	85.88528442382812
8247/28840	I know it will serve me as it did when we came	66.36222076416016
8248/28840	And to think said Mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop	42.120399475097656

8255/28840	Blaisois replied Mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a Frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask Grim	56.442108154296875
8256/28840	Yes but beer asked Blaisois sharply is that their true drink   As to that answered Mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the	53.79904556274414
8257/28840	What Monsieur Mousqueton The Englishdo they dislike wine   They hate	48.42462158203125
8258/28840	But I have seen them drink	98.68997192382812
8259/28840	For example an English prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of Malm	229.45767211914062
8260/28840	I heard the Chevalier dHerblay say	11.467422485351562
8261/28840	The fool cried Blaisois I wish I had been in his	40.38343811035156
8262/28840	Thou canst be said Grimaud writing down his	622.196044921875
8263/28840	How asked Blaisois I can Explain	63.33553695678711
8264/28840	Grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the	247.01370239257812
8265/28840	Port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by DArtagnan and	18.004661560058594
8266/28840	Eh eh ah Those barrels I saw through the door   Port replied Grimaud beginning a fresh	130.2126922607422
8267/28840	I have heard said Blaisois that port is a very good	38.44532775878906
8268/28840	Excellent there is port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracie	16.969694137573242
8269/28840	Suppose we ask these Englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest Blais	108.208984375
8270/28840	Sell cried Mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character	108.47297668457031
8271/28840	One may well perceive young man that you are	334.0277099609375
8272/28840	Why buy what one can take   Take said Blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor That is forbidden it seems to	72.3401107788086
8273/28840	In the commandments of God or of the church I dont know	98.95205688476562
8274/28840	I only know it says Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his	102.69207000732422
8275/28840	That is a childs reason Monsieur Blaisois said Mousqueton in his most patronizing	22.09690284729004
8276/28840	Yes you talk like a childI repeat the	81.12602233886719
8277/28840	Where have you read in the Scriptures I ask you that the English are your neighbors   Where that is true said Blaisois at least I cant now recall	46.57006072998047
8278/28840	A childs reasonI repeat it continued Mousqu	75.58423614501953
8279/28840	If you had been ten years engaged in war as Grimaud and I have been my dear Blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of	34.13312911987305
8280/28840	Now an Englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the English therefore it belongs to	43.6558952331543
8281/28840	And our masters asked Blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion   Mousqueton smiled disdain	24.161434173583984
8282/28840	I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say Gentlemen your servant Mousqueton is	52.52216720581055
8283/28840	What does Monsieur Bracieux care think you whether I am thirsty or not   Tis a very expensive wine said Blaisois shaking his	24.113082885742188
8284/28840	Were it liquid gold Monsieur Blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this	135.39630126953125
8285/28840	Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every	27.980422973632812
8286/28840	His manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine	55.10172653198242
8287/28840	Ah locked he exclaimed these devils of English how suspicious they are   Locked said Blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more	65.87276458740234
8288/28840	Perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in	59.37636184692383
8289/28840	I cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move with a packthread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred	65.03852081298828
8290/28840	No but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered Blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gim	24.301786422729492
8291/28840	Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him	50.997825622558594
8292/28840	Tis true he said but where can I get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask   Trousers said Grimaud still squaring his	50.20353698730469
8293/28840	Grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate	75.28902435302734
8294/28840	Mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his	88.14922332763672
8295/28840	In a few minutes he had extracted three	52.66957473754883
8296/28840	He tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get	56.27903366088867
8297/28840	He sighed and set to work	266.0619812011719
8298/28840	That is true said Mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will pass	41.485599517822266
8299/28840	And he knows the full casks said Blaisois for he has already been in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier dArtagn	16.582250595092773
8300/28840	Let Monsieur Grimaud go in Monsieur M	21.49666976928711
8301/28840	I could go in as well as Grimaud said Mousqueton a little piqu	26.99724006652832
8302/28840	Yes but that would take too much time and I am	44.808475494384766
8303/28840	I am getting more and more seas	38.83696746826172
8304/28840	Go in then Grimaud said Mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gim	39.089988708496094
8305/28840	Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and	43.32994079589844
8306/28840	Blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstas	22.12441635131836
8307/28840	Of all the exploits performed since their arrival in England by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most	84.5677490234375
8308/28840	You are about to see said Mousqueton looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see Blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are	23.677946090698242
8309/28840	My cloak said Grimaud from the bottom of the	76.02120208740234
8310/28840	My cloakstop up the aperture with	108.76618194580078
8311/28840	Simpleton exclaimed Mousqueton suppose any one came into the	67.5821304321289
8312/28840	Ah true cried Blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the	40.811031341552734
8313/28840	Grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered Mousqu	224.3388214111328
8314/28840	As for me when I have no candle I cant take two steps without knocking against	61.81871032714844
8315/28840	Thats because you havent served said Mousqu	90.7296371459961
8316/28840	Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed	35.06643295288086
8317/28840	But hark I think some one is	137.5963592529297
8318/28840	Mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his	26.431201934814453
8319/28840	The door of their cabin was	122.36971282958984
8320/28840	Two men wrapped in their cloaks	68.01005554199219
8321/28840	Oho said they not in bed at a quarter past	195.53329467773438
8322/28840	In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and sn	36.188236236572266
8323/28840	These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after	55.50212478637695
8324/28840	Ah cried Blaisois he is lost   Grimauds a cunning fellow murmured Mousqu	15.469099044799805
8325/28840	They said a quarter of an	23.242904663085938
8326/28840	We still have five minutes replied Mousqu	76.59161376953125
8327/28840	We should have heard the blow	116.1902084350586
8328/28840	But if he doesnt return   Here he	30.77044677734375
8329/28840	At that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around	50.54620361328125
8330/28840	Both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gun	28.438430786132812
8331/28840	Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine Grimaud hastened to awake DArtagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken	34.800270080566406
8332/28840	Imposing silence Grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it p	101.3336181640625
8333/28840	This was the gist of his strange story   The first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was	76.07392120361328
8334/28840	He passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently	185.5847625732422
8335/28840	He was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing	58.683902740478516
8336/28840	His face was hidden under the wide brim of his	45.076019287109375
8337/28840	Grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great	64.42877197265625
8338/28840	Have you the wick asked the one who carried the	113.01240539550781
8339/28840	At the voice of this last speaker Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very	62.15468978881836
8340/28840	He rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of Mord	60.299869537353516
8341/28840	How long will this fuse burn asked this	902.9122924804688
8342/28840	That voice also was known to Grim	170.51771545410156
8343/28840	He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he recognized Gros	40.69324493408203
8344/28840	Then tell the men to be in readinessdont tell them why	173.72889709472656
8345/28840	When the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your	408.65228271484375
8346/28840	That is when I have lighted the match   I will undertake	50.35728073120117
8347/28840	I wish to be sure of my	22.525508880615234
8348/28840	Are the oars in the boat   Everything is	46.8411750793457
8349/28840	Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the	45.186805725097656
8350/28840	You hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty	132.81130981445312
8351/28840	Grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood	109.4992446899414
8352/28840	But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the	155.6327667236328
8353/28840	He had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen Mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which Mordaunt had given in	32.606788635253906
8354/28840	Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and Mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse	34.9051399230957
8355/28840	At the door he stopped to	150.90171813964844
8356/28840	Do you hear how they sleep he	208.89837646484375
8357/28840	In fact Porthos could be heard snoring through the	49.945159912109375
8358/28840	Tis God who gives them into our hands answered Gros	53.15608215332031
8359/28840	This time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined Mord	80.44109344482422
8360/28840	Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent	43.6438102722168
8361/28840	DArtagnan pressing his hand repeated his	77.9701919555664
8362/28840	Athos is near you said DArtagnan warn him as I have warned	41.01155471801758
8363/28840	Aramis easily aroused Athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized	40.20804214477539
8364/28840	But there was more difficulty in arousing Porth	44.65847396850586
8365/28840	He was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when DArtagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his	44.84880828857422
8366/28840	Then our Gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one	84.8580551147461
8367/28840	Friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead	45.645870208740234
8368/28840	Bah said Athos are you still afraid   Do you know who is captain of this vessel  	21.881607055664062
8369/28840	The shudder of the three musketeers showed to DArtagnan that his words began to make some impression on	24.297922134399414
8370/28840	Groslow said Aramis the devil   Who is this Groslow asked Porth	17.207826614379883
8371/28840	Groslow is the man who broke Parrys head and is now getting ready to break	67.07929229736328
8372/28840	Oh oh   And do you know who is his lieutenant   His lieutenant There is none said Ath	37.0188102722168
8373/28840	They dont have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of	53.2752685546875
8374/28840	Yes but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mord	19.985748291015625
8375/28840	This time the musketeers did more than shudderthey almost cried	91.33503723144531
8376/28840	Those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with	120.04866027832031
8377/28840	We must seize the felucca said Aram	29.1219425201416
8378/28840	Those casks which I took for casks of port wine are filled with	96.17851257324219
8379/28840	When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to	106.41986083984375
8380/28840	You have some plan then asked Ath	88.36077880859375
8381/28840	What is it   Have you confidence in me   Give your orders said the three musket	19.23162078857422
8382/28840	DArtagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man	50.201622009277344
8383/28840	He turned it gently on its	170.4282989501953
8384/28840	The deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said Aram	20.305023193359375
8385/28840	Stay here if you like but I warn you twill be rather too warm	75.66967010498047
8386/28840	But we cannot swim to the	74.62885284423828
8387/28840	The longboat is yonder lashed to the felu	29.31957244873047
8388/28840	We will take possession of it and cut the	56.858436584472656
8389/28840	A moments delay said Athos our servants   Here we are they	106.87097930908203
8390/28840	Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which DArtagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the	54.222225189208984
8391/28840	Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry	57.4498176574707
8392/28840	Gracious Heaven we are hesitating cried DArtagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do   I do not hesitate you know said Grim	45.626304626464844
8393/28840	Sir interposed Blaisois I warn you that I can only swim in	21.40976905822754
8394/28840	And I not at all said Mousqu	29.390647888183594
8395/28840	But DArtagnan had now slipped through the	18.248098373413086
8396/28840	Yes the Gascon answered Athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over	100.0884017944336
8397/28840	Porthos kill every one who stands in your	131.42616271972656
8398/28840	And after pressing the hand of Athos DArtagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his	23.093257904052734
8399/28840	Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the	45.66728210449219
8400/28840	DArtagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of	51.88217544555664
8401/28840	Then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of Aramis and Grim	61.931949615478516
8402/28840	I am uneasy about Blaisois said Athos he can he says only swim in	84.6405258178711
8403/28840	When people can swim at all they can swim	266.6552429199219
8404/28840	To the boat to the boat   But Porthos I do not see	20.07880973815918
8405/28840	But monsieur said Mousqueton I cant swim let me stay	19.841327667236328
8406/28840	I assure you I shall be very much in the way in that little boat said Mousqu	27.124488830566406
8407/28840	And I know I shall drown before reaching it continued Blais	74.80767059326172
8408/28840	Come along I shall strangle you both if you dont get out said Porthos at last seizing Mousqueton by the	36.81570053100586
8409/28840	A sublime action at all events for Mousqueton looked upon himself as	110.25312805175781
8410/28840	Ah have you your sword Athos cried DArtagn	25.929903030395508
8411/28840	Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the	39.199134826660156
8412/28840	The felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing	52.83610534667969
8413/28840	Come Athos said DArtagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the Gas	11.945279121398926
8414/28840	Scarcely had DArtagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the	27.332672119140625
8415/28840	That you may be sure said the Gascon means	43.89091110229492
8416/28840	They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind	65.72523498535156
8417/28840	Shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walk	94.29671478271484
8418/28840	In the midst of these screams they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in	55.604801177978516
8419/28840	The agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of Groslow who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the	72.02284240722656
8420/28840	Mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep sl	51.456695556640625
8421/28840	Then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom God blinds he had set fire to the wick of nit	59.21372604370117
8422/28840	All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on	67.75967407226562
8423/28840	Haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said Gros	94.83077239990234
8424/28840	One of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least	44.41563415527344
8425/28840	The cable is cut he cried no boat   How no boat exclaimed Groslow it is	109.26834106445312
8426/28840	Tis true however answered the sailor theres nothing in the wake of the ship besides heres the end of the	48.51875305175781
8427/28840	Whats the matter cried Mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his	53.97014236450195
8428/28840	Only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the	90.82984161376953
8429/28840	Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the	220.5081329345703
8430/28840	Empty he exclaimed the infernal demons   We must pursue them said Groslow they cant be gone far and we will sink them passing over	34.12230682373047
8431/28840	Yes but the fire ejaculated Mordaunt I have lighted	31.680206298828125
8432/28840	Ten thousand devils cried Groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save	41.8050422668457
8433/28840	Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after	188.77670288085938
8434/28840	The instant Groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a	58.35658264160156
8435/28840	Onlythe felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were	28.68109893798828
8436/28840	The four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped	102.94873046875
8437/28840	Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around themthen at last the volcano was extinguishedthen all was dark and stillthe floating bark and heaving	85.95714569091797
8438/28840	By Heaven at last said Athos the first to speak by this time I think all must be	61.27507019042969
8439/28840	Here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the	67.33858489990234
8440/28840	Tis he it is his voice   All still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the	38.15079116821289
8441/28840	After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming	45.777488708496094
8442/28840	Athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his	74.20124053955078
8443/28840	Yes yes I see him well enough said DArtagn	12.887833595275879
8444/28840	Heagain cried Porthos who was breathing like a blacksmiths bellows why he is made of	67.03456115722656
8445/28840	Aramis and DArtagnan whispered to each	10.45926284790039
8446/28840	Mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves Pity pity on me gentlemen in Heavens name my strength is failing me I am	167.17799377441406
8447/28840	The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Ath	79.34967041015625
8448/28840	Indeed said DArtagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your	29.615978240966797
8449/28840	Does he think we are going to take him in Row Porthos	33.4028434753418
8450/28840	And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms	170.97512817382812
8451/28840	Oh you will not abandon me You will not leave me to perish You will not be pitiless cried Mord	31.7838134765625
8452/28840	Ah ah said Porthos to Mordaunt I think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of	42.942630767822266
8453/28840	Oh Porthos murmured the Comte de la F	5.976442337036133
8454/28840	Oh pray for mercys sake dont fly from	72.96308898925781
8455/28840	For pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters	76.28948211669922
8456/28840	DArtagnan however who had consulted with Aramis spoke to the poor w	30.476938247680664
8457/28840	Go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire	181.97744750976562
8458/28840	See the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed Monsieur Groslow and his	35.6741943359375
8459/28840	Sir replied Mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is	47.56825637817383
8460/28840	Gentlemen I am young scarcely twentythree years	289.9446716308594
8461/28840	I was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my	42.88809585571289
8462/28840	You would have done what I	25.424137115478516
8463/28840	Mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural	79.96849822998047
8464/28840	Alas he said I am then to die You are going to kill the son as you killed the mother Surely if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon I ought to be	40.36930847167969
8465/28840	Then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his	34.12338638305664
8466/28840	Oh this is torture to me cried Ath	68.68165588378906
8467/28840	DArtagnan DArtagnan cried Athos my son I entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save	26.82439422607422
8468/28840	I cannot resist doing so he must	54.51034164428711
8469/28840	Aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he sw	32.66993713378906
8470/28840	If he lays his hand on the boats edge I will cut it off regicide that he	52.57278060913086
8471/28840	What are you going to do asked Aram	10.08569049835205
8472/28840	Throw myself in the water and strangle	54.24481201171875
8473/28840	Oh gentlemen cried Athos be men be Christians See death is depicted on his face Ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse Grant me this poor wretchs	84.35871887207031
8474/28840	I will bless youI   I am dying cried Mordaunt come to me come to me   DArtagnan began to be	21.411544799804688
8475/28840	The boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Ath	132.76995849609375
8476/28840	Mordaunt made a last effortroseseized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of	103.86502838134766
8477/28840	Thats right said Athos put your other hand	242.303955078125
8478/28840	And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been	92.40682220458984
8479/28840	Now sir said the count you are safecalm	18.837665557861328
8480/28840	Mute with horror the three friends had remained openmouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was	48.975807189941406
8481/28840	Porthos was the first who came to	32.626312255859375
8482/28840	In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbe	32.79731369018555
8483/28840	Mordaunt Mordaunt cried the three friends tis Mordaunt   But Athos exclaimed DArtagn	42.36037826538086
8484/28840	Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld Athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the	34.43970489501953
8485/28840	Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly Athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with	57.99056625366211
8486/28840	No replied Athos and he   Oh he now we may say at last thank Heaven he is really	42.9260368347168
8487/28840	Look and DArtagnan obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal	47.99415588378906
8488/28840	Athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were	48.40724182128906
8489/28840	Bravo Athos cried Aramis with an emotion very rare in	152.7848663330078
8490/28840	A capital blow you gave cried Porth	262.0112609863281
8491/28840	In short said DArtagnan this has been the will of	22.3076229095459
8492/28840	It was not I who killed him said Athos in a soft low tone twas	40.387916564941406
8493/28840	How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being	62.376834869384766
8494/28840	A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene	77.27574920654297
8495/28840	I have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what I have just	59.128971099853516
8496/28840	Nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation I protest that I feel	66.18313598632812
8497/28840	I have a hundred pounds weight less upon my	143.40235900878906
8498/28840	In fact Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful	67.11621856689453
8499/28840	For my part observed Aramis I cannot say the same as you do Porth	51.36823272705078
8500/28840	I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe my	41.189388275146484
8501/28840	I look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his	52.6141471862793
8502/28840	The poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his	40.407779693603516
8503/28840	I do not reproach you Athos for what you have	15.85071086883545
8504/28840	On the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to	67.59627532958984
8505/28840	So now I breathe againI am happy   Dont be in haste to celebrate a victory Porthos interposed DArtagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now	41.94149398803711
8506/28840	Men may subdue menthey cannot overcome the	105.61204528808594
8507/28840	We are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are	61.77939987182617
8508/28840	You are ungrateful DArtagnan said Athos yes ungrateful to Providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous	21.18164825439453
8509/28840	Let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to Calais or Boulog	44.72820281982422
8510/28840	Should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by	148.6841583251953
8511/28840	Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover and Calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us	52.706703186035156
8512/28840	But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north   That said Athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the	41.05515670776367
8513/28840	Which implies that we may die of hunger said Aram	42.900901794433594
8514/28840	Tis more than possible answered the Comte de la F	16.031009674072266
8515/28840	Mousqueton sighed again more deeply than	57.92551040649414
8516/28840	What is the matter what ails you asked Porth	11.906783103942871
8517/28840	Impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold	83.31256103515625
8518/28840	Ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me sh	152.97702026367188
8519/28840	How is that Mousqueton   Alas your honor in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of	29.78054428100586
8520/28840	What then   Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry	59.084720611572266
8521/28840	Yes sir answered Mousqueton but permit me to say I see nothing laughable in	28.816286087036133
8522/28840	However he added turning to Porthos I should not regret dying sir were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to	34.84980010986328
8523/28840	Mouston replied Porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the	74.81056213378906
8524/28840	And you should call it Devotion added Aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your	39.97970199584961
8525/28840	Chevalier said DArtagnan laughing you could eat a piece of Mouston couldnt you especially after two or three days of fasting   Oh no replied Aramis I should much prefer Blaisois we havent known him so	36.54177474975586
8526/28840	One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of Grimaud were not	47.05998611450195
8527/28840	Suddenly Mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted	36.662288665771484
8528/28840	Oh sir he cried passing the bottle to Porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with	65.2175521850586
8529/28840	This intelligence restored every one save Athos to gay	292.7223205566406
8530/28840	Zounds exclaimed Porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the	173.93902587890625
8531/28840	And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and	64.65469360351562
8532/28840	Now said Athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and I will	81.58906555175781
8533/28840	After some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Ath	96.22254943847656
8534/28840	It was in fact a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulog	34.79180908203125
8535/28840	A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all	77.42652893066406
8536/28840	Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine oclock in the morning having a fair wind our Frenchmen set foot on their native	54.872562408447266
8537/28840	Egad how strong one feels here said Porthos almost burying his large feet in the	82.90628051757812
8538/28840	Zounds I could defy a nation   Be quiet Porthos said DArtagnan we are	35.202327728271484
8539/28840	These people who are looking at us are only merchants said Athos and are looking more at the cargo than at	49.04639434814453
8540/28840	I shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and I shall make for the Dunes as soon as	44.05134963989258
8541/28840	Sandy hills about Dunkirk from which it derives its	138.2017059326172
8542/28840	The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unob	57.1554069519043
8543/28840	Here after a short conference they proposed to	109.04212951660156
8544/28840	Because answered the Gascon we were sent Porthos and I by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell instead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles	32.40098190307617
8545/28840	not the same thing by any	56.61448287963867
8546/28840	In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur dHerblay our crime would be	13.504363059997559
8547/28840	We have circumvented Cromwell Mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Maz	52.53679275512695
8548/28840	You forget replied Athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered	100.3436279296875
8549/28840	Truly Athos interrupted DArtagnan I am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed	47.04907989501953
8550/28840	Come Athos and Aramis go to the right Porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into Normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach	46.90927505493164
8551/28840	He then gave his friends minute directions as to their	229.20298767089844
8552/28840	Ah my dear friend exclaimed Athos how I should admire the resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your	38.625404357910156
8553/28840	Isnt this fox a genius Athos asked the Gas	160.5989532470703
8554/28840	No he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night thats	53.9197883605957
8555/28840	Well is all said  	70.74651336669922

8557/28840	Ah hurrah theres the sun A merry morning to you	174.60804748535156
8558/28840	Tis a long time since I saw thee   Come come DArtagnan said Athos do not affect to be strongminded there are tears in your	16.90092658996582
8559/28840	Let us be open with each other and	151.1260223388672
8560/28840	What cried the Gascon do you think Athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and Aramis   No answered Athos embrace me my	35.87862014770508
8561/28840	Zounds said Porthos sobbing I believe Im crying but how foolish all this is   Then they	77.60609436035156
8562/28840	At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the Dunes	91.27617645263672
8563/28840	At last they lost sight of each	70.71903228759766
8564/28840	Sacrebleu DArtagnan said Porthos I must out with it at once for I cant keep to myself anything I have against you I havent been able to recognize you in this	59.896751403808594
8565/28840	Why not said DArtagnan with his wise	24.147186279296875
8566/28840	Because if as you say Athos and Aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon	37.8743896484375
8567/28840	For my part I confess to you that I was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the Mazarins in the	30.237773895263672
8568/28840	Really said Porthos opening his eyes in aston	7.720101833343506
8569/28840	If they are arrested they will only be put in the Bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the Place de Gre	28.50960922241211
8570/28840	Oh oh said Porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me DArtagn	29.926441192626953
8571/28840	Bah perhaps not so great as you think Porthos you know the proverb All roads lead to	80.90265655517578
8572/28840	But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and Aramis asked Porth	21.612947463989258
8573/28840	we very nearly succeeded in saving	159.34878540039062
8574/28840	We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin and then   The devil said Porthos what can we say to Mazarin   Leave that to meI have my	22.979583740234375
8575/28840	Cromwell is mighty Mazarin is tricky but I would rather have to do with them than with the late Monsieur Mord	32.542938232421875
8576/28840	Ah said Porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late Monsieur Mord	12.554268836975098
8577/28840	The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris followed by Mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too	39.897193908691406
8578/28840	The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint Germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves	58.65391159057617
8579/28840	This threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was	78.25613403320312
8580/28840	Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack Paris by the citizens to defend	210.9516143798828
8581/28840	The latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the Prince de Conti the brother of the Prince de Condé and the Duc de Longueville his brotherin	14.576115608215332
8582/28840	This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of	48.05378341674805
8583/28840	As for the Duc de Beaufort he arrived from Vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the market	30.33171272277832
8584/28840	The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as	74.95098876953125
8585/28840	On the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious	136.68881225585938
8586/28840	They carried a banner on which could be read this strange device We are seeking our	145.91796875
8587/28840	The next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three	64.3580551147461
8588/28840	That was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of	69.17166900634766
8589/28840	On the first day of that month our four companions had landed at Boulogne and in two parties had set out for	28.578039169311523
8590/28840	Toward the end of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens	61.69526290893555
8591/28840	On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in	46.03956985473633
8592/28840	The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his	53.14639663696289
8593/28840	The sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said   Who are you gentlemen   Two	49.89926528930664
8594/28840	And where do you come from   From	26.623863220214844
8595/28840	And what are you going to do in Paris   We are going with a mission to Her Majesty the Queen of	11.046045303344727
8596/28840	Ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of	32.87306594848633
8597/28840	We have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her	105.06410217285156
8598/28840	Where are your passports   We have none we left England ignorant of the state of politics here having left Paris before the departure of the	57.98942947387695
8599/28840	Ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are Mazarinists who are sent as	31.28594207763672
8600/28840	My dear friend here Athos spoke rest assured if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of	98.21183776855469
8601/28840	In your situation distrust those who are well provided with every form	105.10437774658203
8602/28840	Enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the	102.6849136352539
8603/28840	The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some	334.722412109375
8604/28840	In a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded Athos and Aramis and an officer was examining their	70.16931915283203
8605/28840	The first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each	48.735286712646484
8606/28840	The first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the	45.93362045288086
8607/28840	When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to	44.31096267700195
8608/28840	Be it so said Athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible	33.93504333496094
8609/28840	There seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England and if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to	25.52402114868164
8610/28840	On hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than	47.43844223022461
8611/28840	Merciful goodness whispered Aramis to Athos did you see   What asked Ath	32.19496154785156
8612/28840	The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen  	54.5175666809082
8613/28840	At this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said   The passports are in order let these three gentlemen	44.360897064208984
8614/28840	The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this	37.565799713134766
8615/28840	Aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of Ath	20.6495304107666
8616/28840	What is the matter with you my friend asked the	20.812463760375977
8617/28840	I havedoubtless I am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out   Only by their passports they are three Frondists who are gone to rejoin the Duc de Longue	26.823183059692383
8618/28840	Tis strange said Aramis almost involuntarily I fancied that I recognized Mazarin	32.3475227355957
8619/28840	The sergeant burst into a fit of	37.522056579589844
8620/28840	He he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung Not so foolish as all	160.09349060058594
8621/28840	Ah muttered Athos I may be mistaken I havent the unerring eye of DArtagn	25.894014358520508
8622/28840	Who is speaking of Monsieur DArtagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the	14.338881492614746
8623/28840	What cried Aramis and Athos what Planchet   Planchet added Grimaud Planchet with a gorget indeed   Ah gentlemen cried Planchet so you are back again in	18.98027801513672
8624/28840	No sir I am sure he hasnt yet	47.191776275634766
8625/28840	But then he may have stopped at Saint Germ	51.696495056152344
8626/28840	I dont think so we appointed to meet at La Chev	56.07860565185547
8627/28840	And had the pretty Madeleine no news asked Aramis	74.72987365722656
8628/28840	No sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very	83.40605163574219
8629/28840	In fact said Aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey	46.36167907714844
8630/28840	Permit me then my dear Athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to	45.80213928222656
8631/28840	Ah monsieur le chevalier said Planchet b	7.1608381271362305
8632/28840	Lieutenant with a promise of becoming	414.4108581542969
8633/28840	So owing to your popularity   No thanks to something	62.16061782836914
8634/28840	You know gentlemen that I served the Piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant  	38.69144821166992
8635/28840	Well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left I succeeded I did in making them all begin with the same foot and I was made lieutenant on the	91.45034790039062
8636/28840	So I presume said Athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you  	28.48954963684082
8637/28840	There are the Prince de Conti the Duc de Longueville the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon the Marechal de la Mothe the Marquis de Sevigne and I dont know who for my	9.68808364868164
8638/28840	And the Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne inquired Athos in a tremulous	9.398743629455566
8639/28840	DArtagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in	35.87221145629883
8640/28840	Yes count nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant	47.65593719482422
8641/28840	Then said Athos in a tone of delight he is well no accident has happened to him   None	28.98324203491211
8642/28840	And he lives   Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlem	31.675735473632812
8643/28840	And passes his time   Sometimes with the queen of England sometimes with Madame de Chevre	63.91524887084961
8644/28840	He and the Count de Guiche are like each others	28.067991256713867
8645/28840	Thanks Planchet thanks cried Athos extending his hand to the	18.103439331054688
8646/28840	Oh sir Planchet only touched the tips of the counts	45.378684997558594
8647/28840	Well what are you doing countto a former lackey   My friend said Athos he has given me news of Ra	23.682666778564453
8648/28840	And now gentlemen said Planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do   Reenter Paris if you will let us my good Planc	28.03302001953125
8649/28840	Let you sir Now as ever I am nothing but your	152.2713165283203
8650/28840	Then turning to his men   Allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the Duc de Beau	35.737998962402344
8651/28840	Long live the Duc de Beaufort cried the sentin	26.84661293029785
8652/28840	Take notice captain he continued giving Planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these	122.80742645263672
8653/28840	And I said Planchet with dignity I know them and I answer for	31.654155731201172
8654/28840	As he said this he pressed Grimauds hand who seemed honored by the	89.06092834472656
8655/28840	Farewell till we meet again said Aramis as they took leave of Planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for	30.928211212158203
8656/28840	Sir said Planchet I am in all things at your	21.436092376708984
8657/28840	That fellow is no fool said Aramis as he got on his	60.94834899902344
8658/28840	How should he be replied Athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your	147.46788024902344
8659/28840	The two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the Lou	46.661720275878906
8660/28840	They reached the queens apartments but were compelled to stop in the antechamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from	60.0220947265625
8661/28840	We too said Athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from England but have just come from	47.578636169433594
8662/28840	What then are your names gentlemen   The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay said Aram	6.381698131561279
8663/28840	Ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a	34.30251693725586
8664/28840	Please follow me and he went on before followed by Athos and Aram	26.793846130371094
8665/28840	On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen	51.07555389404297
8666/28840	Oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the	26.970258712768555
8667/28840	The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other	36.4307861328125
8668/28840	Come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door	230.78451538085938
8669/28840	All these gentlemen had been noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low	19.874155044555664
8670/28840	Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens	21.893577575683594
8671/28840	Go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the Duc de Chat	25.647981643676758
8672/28840	You said that His Majesty King Charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects   Yes madame Chatillon stammered	54.139034271240234
8673/28840	Athos and Aramis were more and more	16.73800277709961
8674/28840	And that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant	55.53593444824219
8675/28840	Just so madame replied Chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this	37.08293914794922
8676/28840	The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with	28.537805557250977
8677/28840	Now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said Chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of Ath	38.75184631347656
8678/28840	One momentI begfor here are the Chevalier dHerblay and the Comte de la Fere just arrived from London and they can give you as eyewitnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal	30.88413429260254
8679/28840	Speak gentlemen speakI am listening conceal nothing gloss over	1017.2153930664062
8680/28840	Since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to	48.2210807800293
8681/28840	Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his	26.96039581298828
8682/28840	Well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his pal	107.76260375976562
8683/28840	Speak sir I beg you to do	44.71230697631836
8684/28840	I beg you to excuse me madame I wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been	34.18418502807617
8685/28840	Mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then   Sir interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the	31.311843872070312
8686/28840	I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be to accuse Her Majesty Queen Anne of	52.27817153930664
8687/28840	With the queen sir replied Athos in his calm vibrating	35.96541976928711
8688/28840	Explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every	421.5237731933594
8689/28840	On your brow I read despairyour lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidingsyour hands trem	206.9298553466797
8690/28840	Oh my God my God what has happened   Lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us   Sir said Chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the	26.127696990966797
8691/28840	Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch	80.28700256347656
8692/28840	We ought not therefore I think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier	108.24996185302734
8693/28840	Queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy	159.14132690429688
8694/28840	Athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which Charles	64.66129302978516
8695/28840	before his death had placed in the hands of Aram	21.68061065673828
8696/28840	Since the moment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted with	73.63075256347656
8697/28840	He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent	104.01187133789062
8698/28840	The queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lipsand without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her	25.262733459472656
8699/28840	Now chevalier he added turning to Aramis let us	13.696634292602539
8700/28840	said Aramis we have still a word to say to these	44.53729248046875
8701/28840	And turning to Chatillon Sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I cannot say before the	40.638851165771484
8702/28840	Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground	43.18378448486328
8703/28840	Sir said Aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary	30.169902801513672
8704/28840	That would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a	58.439064025878906
8705/28840	You know well that I dont like to leave things half	117.65621185302734
8706/28840	Conclude then sir answered De Chatillon with as much hauteur as Aram	82.05096435546875
8707/28840	Gentlemen resumed Aramis any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrestedfor we have friends in Parisbut we are contented with another	52.94655990600586
8708/28840	Come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terr	92.98399353027344
8709/28840	I know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept	44.40476608276367
8710/28840	And why not said Aramis in his tone of ra	34.77228927612305
8711/28840	Is it Mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent   Oh you hear that Flamarens said Chat	33.485267639160156
8712/28840	Not to reply would be a blot on my name and my	76.34913635253906
8713/28840	You will not reply however and these gentlemen I am sure will presently be of my	100.95626831054688
8714/28840	Aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insol	12.044960021972656
8715/28840	Chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his	106.82120513916016
8716/28840	Duke said Flamarens you forget that tomorrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the	76.61865234375
8717/28840	Until tomorrow evening you are not at your own	59.07187271118164
8718/28840	Let it be then the day after tomorrow said Aram	38.24383544921875
8719/28840	Tomorrow rather said De Chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of Charent	35.16324234008789
8720/28840	How can you doubt it sir For the pleasure of a meeting with you I would go to the end of the	26.068424224853516
8721/28840	Are you going to rejoin your cardinal Swear first on your honor not to inform him of our	38.60502624511719
8722/28840	Conditions   Why not   Because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors	37.14491653442383
8723/28840	Then let us draw on the	66.36861419677734
8724/28840	It is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows	141.23904418945312
8725/28840	Chatillon and Flamarens looked at each	42.275455474853516
8726/28840	For what reason is all this fume and fury asked Ath	150.27671813964844
8727/28840	What have they done to you   Theydid you not see what they did  	32.99516677856445
8728/28840	They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in	97.60733795166016
8729/28840	Now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the	47.70915603637695
8730/28840	However Im glad not to fight them until	190.0240020751953
8731/28840	I hope we shall have something better to do tonight than to draw the	23.057540893554688
8732/28840	What have we to do   Egad to take Maz	34.93955612182617
8733/28840	These undertakings do not suit me as you know Aram	45.67830276489258
8734/28840	Why   Because it is taking people unaw	53.10306930541992
8735/28840	Really Athos you would make a singular	112.16139221191406
8736/28840	You would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the	91.74412536621094
8737/28840	You know one cannot change his nature he	268.12469482421875
8738/28840	Besides do you know what is our situation and whether Mazarins arrest wouldnt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage   Say at once you disapprove of my	56.60490417480469
8739/28840	I think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in	45.39083480834961
8740/28840	I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite	148.12356567382812
8741/28840	Where   Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon and to tell them about	20.515308380126953
8742/28840	Yes but on one conditionthat we begin by the coadj	33.52766036987305
8743/28840	He is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him	58.59199523925781
8744/28840	It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon as his house came first but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne to see Ra	24.41581153869629
8745/28840	They reentered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois they went on foot to the Rue Gueneg	18.612255096435547
8746/28840	But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlem	14.004664421081543
8747/28840	He had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received	33.506492614746094
8748/28840	The night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of	85.63088989257812
8749/28840	On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood	54.45228958129883
8750/28840	Oh cried Aramis do you see count   Yes said Ath	15.932732582092285
8751/28840	Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be   What do you think Aramis   Why they are our	29.460880279541016
8752/28840	You are not mistaken I recognize Monsieur de Flamaren	12.350869178771973
8753/28840	As to the cavalier in the brown cloak   It is the	27.776124954223633
8754/28840	How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon   Athos smiled but did not	26.211748123168945
8755/28840	Five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes	194.36183166503906
8756/28840	This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Contis	24.33011245727539
8757/28840	He was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of	29.6719970703125
8758/28840	Everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to	56.60325622558594
8759/28840	Meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his	35.332454681396484
8760/28840	Ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the	42.40208053588867
8761/28840	But I as you see am nailed to my bedah this demon goutthis demon gout   My lord said Athos we are just arrived from England and our first concern is to inquire after your	57.73027801513672
8762/28840	Thanks gentlemen thanks As you see my health is but	342.62744140625
8763/28840	And King Charles is well as I have just heard   He is dead my lord said Aram	32.517677307128906
8764/28840	Pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it	60.79692077636719
8765/28840	Dead on the scaffold condemned by	53.61819839477539
8766/28840	Impossible   And executed in our	196.24205017089844
8767/28840	What then has Monsieur de Flamarens been telling me   Monsieur de Flamarens   Yes he has just gone	13.377297401428223
8768/28840	With two companions yes replied the d	79.56892395019531
8769/28840	Then he added with a certain uneasiness Did you meet them   Why yes I think soin the street said Athos and he looked smilingly at Aramis who looked at him with an expression of	17.45464515686035
8770/28840	The devil take this gout cried Monsieur de Bouillon evidently ill at	43.68012237548828
8771/28840	My lord said Athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much	55.290462493896484
8772/28840	One must replied Monsieur de Bouillon sacrifice ones comfort to the public good but I confess to you I am now almost	65.60938262939453
8773/28840	My spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout oercrows	152.73825073242188
8774/28840	Accept it my lord accept it said Aram	63.69798278808594

8776/28840	Go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your	46.891815185546875
8777/28840	Poor King Charles But after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve	100.21294403076172
8778/28840	Oh as to that said Aramis we are	43.07441711425781
8779/28840	Mazarin especially   Yes do you know I am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly	65.1280517578125
8780/28840	Oh the devil take this gout   Athos and Aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the	25.10662841796875
8781/28840	When they reached the street Aramis said   Well Athos what do you think   Of whom   Pardieu of Monsieur de Bou	14.574041366577148
8782/28840	My friend I think that he is much troubled with g	76.77342224121094
8783/28840	You noticed that I didnt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit   You did well you would have caused him an access of his	65.53134155273438
8784/28840	Let us go to Monsieur de Beau	12.112704277038574
8785/28840	The two friends went to the Hotel de Vend	13.781304359436035
8786/28840	It was ten oclock when they	25.260854721069336
8787/28840	The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the Hotel de Bouillon and presented as warlike an	34.03132247924805
8788/28840	There were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses sadd	37.92564392089844
8789/28840	Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to	27.669023513793945
8790/28840	Ah ah gentlemen said Aramis decidedly it is a night for	117.23379516601562
8791/28840	We shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting	110.85102081298828
8792/28840	Oh as to that sir replied Chatillon for it was he who with Flamarens was leaving the Duc de Beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing	48.27313232421875
8793/28840	I hope that is true said Aram	15.618118286132812
8794/28840	As for me I am sure of it said the d	10.11448860168457
8795/28840	De Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and Aramis dis	18.640117645263672
8796/28840	Comte de la Fere the man cried out Chevalier dHerblay How does it happen that you are in Paris   Rochefort cried the two	11.692846298217773
8797/28840	Yes we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois as you know and we are going to give Mazarin something to	25.67140007019043
8798/28840	You are still with us I presume   More than	31.913835525512695
8799/28840	And the duke   Furious against the	39.586605072021484
8800/28840	You know his successour dear duke He is really king of Paris he cant go out without being mobbed by his admire	136.37326049804688
8801/28840	Ah so much the better Can we have the honor of seeing his highness   I shall be proud to present you and Rochefort walked	24.473241806030273
8802/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends	25.656696319580078
8803/28840	Ah he cried by Jove youre welcome sir	76.16615295410156
8804/28840	You are coming to sup with me are you not Boisgoli tell Noirmont that I have two	41.743499755859375
8805/28840	You know Noirmont do you not The successor of Father Marteau who makes the excellent pies you know	37.49864196777344
8806/28840	Boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for La Rame	53.289825439453125
8807/28840	Thank God we dont want either rope ladders or gagpears	416.8246765136719
8808/28840	My lord said Athos do not let us disturb	27.262338638305664
8809/28840	We came merely to inquire after your health and to take your	69.4364013671875
8810/28840	My lord said Athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordships service and his most faithful	33.66990661621094
8811/28840	My most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved	101.77932739257812
8812/28840	And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to you I hope that I remain your friend as well as that ofwhat the devil are their namesDArtagnan and Porthos   DArtagnan and Porth	18.463626861572266
8813/28840	You understand then Comte de la Fere you understand Chevalier dHerblay that I am altogether and always at your	18.32809066772461
8814/28840	Athos and Aramis bowed and went	14.389694213867188
8815/28840	Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said Aram	21.95412254333496
8816/28840	They directed their horses to the	89.01626586914062
8817/28840	On arriving at the cradle from which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a	83.2757797241211
8818/28840	The palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in Paris but in	56.983341217041016
8819/28840	Some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with	38.53976058959961
8820/28840	The friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their	89.03961181640625
8821/28840	The palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the	56.2445068359375
8822/28840	Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the antechamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in	25.745105743408203
8823/28840	Good heavens said Aramis to Athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his antechamber   My dear friend we must take people as we find	34.4493293762207
8824/28840	The coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of Paris and has a	26.515077590942383
8825/28840	Let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of	49.529056549072266
8826/28840	Let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left	42.484588623046875
8827/28840	Ah if Im not mistaken heres Baz	217.11111450195312
8828/28840	Bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing	31.91586685180664
8829/28840	A truce to compliments said Aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in	40.939369201660156
8830/28840	Certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the antechamber only just now he has a secret conference with Monsieur de Bru	30.720401763916016
8831/28840	De Bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said Aramis so we give it	41.91908264160156
8832/28840	And they hastened to quit the palace followed by Bazin who was lavish of bows and	37.0189323425293
8833/28840	Well said Athos when Aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin   You are wisdom incarnate Athos Aramis	27.6556339263916
8834/28840	What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England which they thought should have arrested the attention of all	58.8046875
8835/28840	In fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre no one appeared to be aware that Charles	50.897003173828125
8836/28840	had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaff	36.37134552001953
8837/28840	The two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter	34.30211639404297
8838/28840	At ten oclock the next day they met	45.31562805175781
8839/28840	Athos had been out since six o	55.25211715698242
8840/28840	Well have you any news Athos	43.33134460449219
8841/28840	No one has seen DArtagnan and Porthos has not	14.460079193115234
8842/28840	In fact said Athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we	85.47407531738281
8843/28840	Add to that DArtagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting	36.2717399597168
8844/28840	He expected you will remember to be here on the	105.81988525390625
8845/28840	And here we are at the	45.18336486816406
8846/28840	This evening the margin of possible delay	209.43417358398438
8847/28840	What do you think should be done asked Athos if we have no news of them tonight   Pardieu we must go and look for	18.709440231323242
8848/28840	A light cloud passed over the counts	164.48861694335938
8849/28840	Raoul gives me much uneasiness he	72.09371948242188
8850/28840	He received yesterday a message from the Prince de Condé he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not	35.0384521484375
8851/28840	Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse   She was not at	22.769920349121094
8852/28840	And you Aramis you were going I think to visit Madame de Longue	27.081298828125
8853/28840	Well   She was no longer there but she had left her new	22.42769432067871
8854/28840	Where was she   Guess I give you a thousand	77.29553985595703
8855/28840	How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists was at midnight for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit	44.574012756347656
8856/28840	At the Hotel de Ville my dear	55.950347900390625
8857/28840	You didnt tell me of that Aram	91.88829803466797
8858/28840	Really It was my forgetfulness then pardon	270.41748046875
8859/28840	Now asked Athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening Here we are without occupation it seems to	44.635108947753906
8860/28840	You forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of Charenton I hope to see Monsieur de Chatillon whom Ive hated for a long time	29.707176208496094
8861/28840	Why have you hated him   Because he is the brother of Colign	27.81751251220703
8862/28840	Ah true he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished that ought to satisfy	94.27733612060547
8863/28840	Yes but it does not I am rancorousthe only stigma that proves me to be a church	41.26914596557617
8864/28840	Do you understand You understand that you are in no way obliged to go with	38.184505462646484
8865/28840	Come now said Athos you are	36.46439743041992
8866/28840	I supposed said Athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike	138.5113983154297
8867/28840	No doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the	171.7149658203125
8868/28840	Come come dear Athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this	51.14726638793945
8869/28840	Well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with DArtagnan Porthos and possibly even Ra	38.59650421142578
8870/28840	Stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by Jupiter and their captainsee he has the true military	134.8544158935547
8871/28840	Lieutenant yesterday said Aramis captain today colonel doubtless tomorrow in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of	149.26283264160156
8872/28840	Question him about the fight said Ath	52.715309143066406
8873/28840	This day will be a warm one said Planchet in a warlike	29.870576858520508
8874/28840	No doubt said Aramis but it is far from here to the	45.46788024902344
8875/28840	Sir the distance will be diminished said a	443.1954345703125
8876/28840	Aramis saluted then turning toward Athos   I dont care to camp on the Place Royale with all these people he	27.361759185791016
8877/28840	Shall we go forward We shall see better what is going	49.531463623046875
8878/28840	And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for	14.080002784729004
8879/28840	Come then my friend we will go	60.78323745727539
8880/28840	Havent you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own account   My friend said Athos I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely	26.709617614746094
8881/28840	And how long ago was that   When I last drew my poni	51.33436965942383
8882/28840	Ah Good another souvenir of Monsieur Mord	60.40612030029297
8883/28840	Well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that	85.44624328613281
8884/28840	Hush said Athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of Mordauntit will bring bad	49.79098892211914
8885/28840	And Athos set forward toward Charenton followed closely by Aram	56.221553802490234
8886/28840	As Athos and Aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of	26.177305221557617
8887/28840	There is now a truce and a	77.80833435058594
8888/28840	The prince Monsieur de Retz the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon are talking over public	10.482831954956055
8889/28840	Now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet	64.3263931274414
8890/28840	Sir said Aramis you speak to the	35.36798095703125
8891/28840	Allow me to ask you a question Where are the plenipotentiaries   At Charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of	28.226720809936523
8892/28840	And was this conference arranged beforehand   No gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Paris	66.49364471435547
8893/28840	Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made	31.279020309448242
8894/28840	And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked Athos belongs to   To Monsieur de Chanleu who commands your troops at Charent	41.870567321777344
8895/28840	I say your troops for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs   Yes almost said Aram	28.899255752563477
8896/28840	We are for the king and the princes added Ath	32.522071838378906
8897/28840	We must understand each other said the d	22.20457649230957
8898/28840	The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Condé although I must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one	45.27279281616211
8899/28840	Sir since you command the cavalry   Pardon me I am commanderinch	42.81976318359375
8900/28840	You must know all your officersI mean those more	281.0626220703125

8903/28840	I can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon the substitute for Monsieur dArtagnan still holds his	24.158138275146484
8904/28840	The two friends looked at each	11.712122917175293
8905/28840	It is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the	48.21170425415039
8906/28840	If we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must	28.260990142822266
8907/28840	Yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte   Yes sir answered Athos agitated so much so that I wish to see him if	21.24641227722168
8908/28840	Quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to	33.75107192993164
8909/28840	Halloo there cried Aramis turning around what a noise behind us   A body of cavaliers is coming toward us said Chat	51.25082015991211
8910/28840	I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist	44.708984375
8911/28840	And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich	32.71403503417969
8912/28840	They are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them   They are beating the rappel cried Chatillon we must discover what is going	61.51129150390625
8913/28840	In fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the Duc de Beaufort drew his	66.48165893554688
8914/28840	On his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops ran to	52.913509368896484
8915/28840	Farewell till the next time we meet cried Chatillon and he set off full gall	48.196807861328125
8916/28840	Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the Duc de Beau	16.009292602539062
8917/28840	As to the Duc de Bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to Paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the Duc dElbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a	26.90178108215332
8918/28840	Meantime between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the	96.88677978515625
8919/28840	Gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar theres the enemy	58.621788024902344
8920/28840	Let us save them half of their	229.61856079101562
8921/28840	And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the	46.37104034423828
8922/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort sent his cavalry toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sort	29.238229751586914
8923/28840	The battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of val	66.35763549804688
8924/28840	His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against	86.5379638671875
8925/28840	Chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in	58.18525695800781
8926/28840	This charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that Chanleu was almost	119.65193176269531
8927/28840	He commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally	123.15241241455078
8928/28840	Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pelemele the intrenchments with the fug	67.74945831298828
8929/28840	Aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with	55.704986572265625
8930/28840	His bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise	93.67113494873047
8931/28840	On the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in	42.43727493286133
8932/28840	The cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted	32.44473648071289
8933/28840	Ah tis you Monsieur de Chatillon cried the chevalier welcome to youI expected	31.245622634887695
8934/28840	I hope I have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here I	40.80149841308594
8935/28840	Monsieur de Chatillon cried Aramis taking from his saddlebags a second pistol I think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead	22.94149398803711
8936/28840	Thank God sir they are not   And the duke pointing his pistol at Aramis	68.26152801513672
8937/28840	But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the dukes finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching	54.16099548339844
8938/28840	Oh youve missed me cried Aramis but I swear to Heaven I will not miss	40.67877197265625
8939/28840	If I give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn	39.08721923828125
8940/28840	Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and Athos who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out Fire fire then when the shot was	25.228761672973633
8941/28840	De Chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his	13.363907814025879
8942/28840	The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuir	40.01390838623047
8943/28840	I am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the	22.510025024414062
8944/28840	I told you this I am now grieved I have kept my	34.247642517089844
8945/28840	Can I be of any use to you   Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the	34.74274826049805
8946/28840	He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming Raoul   Raoul cried Ath	31.38156509399414
8947/28840	The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the Chevalier dHerblay two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul but Aramis protected him with his	22.097843170166016
8948/28840	Athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the	32.67917251586914
8949/28840	At this crisis of the battle the prince who had been seconding De Chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the	83.48869323730469
8950/28840	On seeing him the regiment of Corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the Parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered Charenton	22.17039680480957
8951/28840	The coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by Athos Raoul and Aram	36.72844314575195
8952/28840	Aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when Athos stopped	52.74698257446289
8953/28840	On on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the Fronde	75.20369720458984
8954/28840	The three cavaliers continued their road on full gall	60.90102767944336
8955/28840	It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la F	25.209251403808594
8956/28840	What you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier   I did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir said Raoul blushing though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in	29.280498504638672
8957/28840	Thank you for the compliment my young friend replied Aramis we can see from whom you learned	127.44317626953125
8958/28840	Then you were going to Rueil   Yes I have a despatch from the prince to his em	14.283647537231445
8959/28840	You must still deliver it said Ath	58.8183708190918
8960/28840	No false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very desp	108.21723937988281
8961/28840	This young man must not however fail in his duty said Ath	60.20256423950195
8962/28840	In the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget	110.58740997314453
8963/28840	What I propose to do is fair in war the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of	114.28700256347656
8964/28840	The young man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of	39.22434997558594
8965/28840	Give him the despatch Raoul you are the chevaliers	87.71763610839844
8966/28840	Raoul gave it up reluctantly Aramis instantly seized and read	168.09837341308594
8967/28840	You he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to	57.19475173950195
8968/28840	Athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about DArtagnan conquered his unwillingness to read	42.584712982177734
8969/28840	My lord I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges the ten men you	30.11829376220703
8970/28840	They are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful	86.98016357421875
8971/28840	Yes let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has yet heard from his former	74.03209686279297
8972/28840	That poor Planchet You speak of him very much at your ease Aramis he has probably been	45.75516128540039
8973/28840	All those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massac	169.51820373535156
8974/28840	On leaving Paris Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of	51.65031814575195
8975/28840	Besides they felt that the _dénouement_ of this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to	36.869354248046875
8976/28840	Besides there was no tranquillity in Paris	37.98408508300781
8977/28840	Provisions began to fail and whenever one of the Prince de Contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his	80.21265411376953
8978/28840	In one of these risings the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and library of Mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw	31.633159637451172
8979/28840	Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coupdetat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charent	22.141550064086914
8980/28840	They quitted Paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by	146.84266662597656
8981/28840	Having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to Boulogne at Abbeville and followed it step by step examining every	83.35360717773438
8982/28840	Nevertheless they were still in a state of	38.87495803833008
8983/28840	Several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at Montreuil Athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate	108.75466918945312
8984/28840	He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife  	54.81220626831055
8985/28840	This is capital said Athos to Aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push	32.25490951538086
8986/28840	There the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed   Trust me said Aramis do not expect to find anything in Abbe	56.491920471191406
8987/28840	If we had only been looking for Porthos Porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced	20.79421615600586
8988/28840	But DArtagnan is devoid of such	46.09178161621094
8989/28840	Porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere	43.69430160522461
8990/28840	His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon	141.66017150878906
8991/28840	They had not looked carefully enough for their lost	230.67274475097656
8992/28840	They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their	67.6368408203125
8993/28840	Oh exclaimed Athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was DArtagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in	62.63841247558594
8994/28840	Had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken	52.31702423095703
8995/28840	You are right Aramis let us travel	36.13364791870117
8996/28840	To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be	95.47702026367188
8997/28840	Uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of Athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aram	68.52699279785156
8998/28840	They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the	49.158267974853516
8999/28840	All at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous	41.47657775878906
9000/28840	It had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant	254.02923583984375
9001/28840	Oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either Hercules or Porth	30.52161407470703
9002/28840	Let us get down count and examine this	466.066650390625
9003/28840	The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it	109.50670623779297
9004/28840	With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone	57.84609603881836
9005/28840	Upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words   Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing	63.863059997558594
9006/28840	If we reach Compiegne we shall stop at the Peac	24.062881469726562
9007/28840	It is kept by a friend of	67.90515899658203
9008/28840	At last we have something definite said Athos let us go to the Peac	37.82879638671875
9009/28840	Yes answered Aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost brokenwind	29.512496948242188
9010/28840	Aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off	41.27540588378906
9011/28840	The men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported	323.0098571777344
9012/28840	In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peac	19.136676788330078
9013/28840	The host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a Chin	43.56107711791992
9014/28840	They asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rap	40.61212921142578
9015/28840	Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the	120.34342956542969
9016/28840	I see that you are the friends of these	19.82988739013672
9017/28840	Well what has happened to them   They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the	20.68796730041504
9018/28840	Eight said Aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and DArtagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight	22.307723999023438
9019/28840	The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by	53.05706787109375
9020/28840	Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said Aram	39.10625457763672
9021/28840	Toward the town of Louvres was the	93.72820281982422
9022/28840	The two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to Louv	37.079078674316406
9023/28840	Here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that	94.2264175415039
9024/28840	DArtagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of	46.23313903808594
9025/28840	They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counteras their friends must have done before	50.50225830078125
9026/28840	The counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin Rue	77.38770294189453

9185/28840	We have accomplished more difficult things than	79.89307403564453
9186/28840	In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable	44.699913024902344
9187/28840	Today the third will be there	82.84696197509766
9188/28840	As long as they are in prison all will be well said Anne but one of these days they will get	50.09470748901367
9189/28840	Ah exclaimed Anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets Paris   Why so   On account of the Bastile sir which is so strong and so	58.474212646484375
9190/28840	Madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain Paris with Paris the Bastile and our four bullies shall rot	40.839908599853516
9191/28840	Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin in taking leave kissed her	290.43231201171875
9192/28840	Mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went	698.62939453125
9193/28840	Anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her	52.99359130859375
9194/28840	I once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said I shall do but I have done so and	79.54407501220703
9195/28840	That man knew of retreats more secure than Rueil darker and more silent even than the Bast	86.69772338867188
9196/28840	After quitting Anne Mazarin took the road to Rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised	76.65541076660156
9197/28840	In military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome	139.7827911376953
9198/28840	In the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach and reached the Seine at Chat	34.24014663696289
9199/28840	The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queens generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at	109.36357116699219
9200/28840	Athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by Comminges followed the cardinal in	60.3506965637207
9201/28840	Grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near Aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had	56.71359634399414
9202/28840	Grimaud had indeed during twentytwo years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than Athoss imminent death was likely to make him	59.28302764892578
9203/28840	At the branching off of the road toward Paris Aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned	53.00547790527344
9204/28840	Mazarin went to the right hand and Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the	73.86072540283203
9205/28840	Athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back	72.41779327392578
9206/28840	The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow Athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his	36.4093132019043
9207/28840	Ten minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at Rueil as he alighted Comminges approached	26.431346893310547
9208/28840	My lord he asked where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la Fere to be lodged   In the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard	16.998241424560547
9209/28840	I wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the	59.75565719604492
9210/28840	My lord answered Comminges he begs to be taken to the place where Monsieur dArtagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orang	22.413602828979492
9211/28840	Tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in the Fr	65.98672485351562
9212/28840	If we put these three men together Monsieur Comminges said Mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodig	29.878263473510742
9213/28840	Comminges smiled Mazarin read and construed that	255.663330078125
9214/28840	You do not know these men Monsieur Comminges but I know them first personally also by hears	67.92005157470703
9215/28840	I sent them to carry aid to King Charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among	76.02845001220703
9216/28840	But since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison   In prison said Mazarin and when has Rueil been a prison   Ever since there were prisoners in it answered Comm	42.09535217285156
9217/28840	These gentlemen Comminges are not prisoners returned Mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my	102.68256378173828
9218/28840	Well while taking my walk I will call on him and we will	117.1055679321289
9219/28840	Although he professes to be my enemy I have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange	95.90560913085938
9220/28840	Comminges bowed and returned to Athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the	38.920494079589844
9221/28840	Sir replied Comminges it seems that it is	24.442617416381836
9222/28840	Monsieur de Comminges said Athos I have been a soldier all my life and I know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render	30.592252731323242
9223/28840	I am entirely at your service except only for my	32.623958587646484
9224/28840	Thank you sir what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any	51.816104888916016
9225/28840	If it should even compromise me a little said Monsieur de Comminges with a smile still make your	49.30733108520508
9226/28840	I dont like Mazarin any better than you	42.72372055053711
9227/28840	I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but I serve the one with joy and the other against my	53.32355499267578
9228/28840	Speak then I beg of you I wait and	138.3382568359375
9229/28840	Since there is no harm said Athos in my knowing that DArtagnan is here I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am	28.245874404907227
9230/28840	I have received no orders on that	72.77337646484375
9231/28840	Well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that I am his	44.25812911987305
9232/28840	Which cannot last interrupted Comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison	103.07481384277344
9233/28840	But there are oubliettes replied Athos	54.30621337890625
9234/28840	Oh thats a different thing yes I know there are traditions of that sort said Comm	58.17793273925781
9235/28840	It was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our Mazarinimpossible an Italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as	40.608585357666016
9236/28840	Oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such as he is would not have recourse to	50.508811950683594
9237/28840	Your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of France would demand an explanation of your	61.644805908203125
9238/28840	No no be easy on that	76.06449890136719
9239/28840	I will however inform Monsieur dArtagnan of your arrival	24.978605270385742
9240/28840	Comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orang	19.112560272216797
9241/28840	They passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and court	57.48837661743164
9242/28840	From the ends of these two wings extended the	129.51931762695312
9243/28840	Athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by Comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where DArtagnan was	39.87626266479492
9244/28840	For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears and I chose the latter at any rate it is a French	73.78064727783203
9245/28840	Poor DArtagnan said Athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he	32.544551849365234
9246/28840	You have two unruly prisoners there	380.57611083984375
9247/28840	Unruly Comminges smiled you wish to terrify me I	190.68580627441406
9248/28840	When he came here Monsieur DArtagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order I suppose to have his sword	44.564491271972656
9249/28840	That mood lasted some time but now hes as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon songs which make one die of	170.09503173828125
9250/28840	Ah hes quite another sort of persona formidable gentleman	206.8338623046875
9251/28840	The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left	50.96755599975586
9252/28840	But his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about	132.65818786621094
9253/28840	Do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked Comminges who putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the Comte de la Fere had said began to feel a degree of uneas	30.390945434570312
9254/28840	Athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by DArtagn	44.04277038574219
9255/28840	Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied They They are two hotheadsthe one a Gascon the other from Picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down	121.54590606689453
9256/28840	You have had a proof of that in what you have just related to	35.6247444152832
9257/28840	This too was the opinion of Comminges who withdrew somewhat	115.08822631835938
9258/28840	Athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a noble	53.333194732666016
9259/28840	He awaited Mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present	153.18630981445312
9260/28840	Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting	41.508392333984375
9261/28840	At the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of Ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of	76.38572692871094
9262/28840	It was in this pavilion on the ground floor that DArtagnan and Porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different	24.852453231811523
9263/28840	DArtagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servants	37.963680267333984
9264/28840	Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just	68.43950653076172
9265/28840	The one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was med	77.53234100341797
9266/28840	The other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half	78.9991226196289
9267/28840	But his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes sn	50.608726501464844
9268/28840	We have been in this place nearly eightythree	24.536117553710938
9269/28840	Hem muttered Porthos with a kind of pretense of	37.768428802490234
9270/28840	Did you hear eternal sleeper cried DArtagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the	37.77250671386719
9271/28840	I say we have been here eightythree	27.478193283081055
9272/28840	How my fault   Yes I offered you	104.65988159179688
9273/28840	By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door  	172.9888916015625
9274/28840	Porthos men like us cant go out from here purely and	130.73399353027344
9275/28840	Faith said Porthos as for me I could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too	38.32048416137695
9276/28840	And besides he said going out of this chamber isnt	49.12275695800781
9277/28840	Dear friend said Porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than you were	66.8136978149414
9278/28840	Explain to me why going out of this chamber isnt	124.68112182617188
9279/28840	Because having neither arms nor password we shouldnt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sent	61.62998962402344
9280/28840	Very well said Porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his	23.45909309387207
9281/28840	Lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this	177.02255249023438
9282/28840	Ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time I did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study Rue	36.89481735229492
9283/28840	What difference does that make said Porth	144.63214111328125
9284/28840	We shall go out all the	85.18965911865234
9285/28840	Do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands   No said Porthos but I should be glad to be	22.15354347229004
9286/28840	It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly	115.15699768066406
9287/28840	What then   Why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed	49.641517639160156
9288/28840	And what have master pastrycooks to do with us   We ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at	42.643619537353516
9289/28840	In England lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our	93.65416717529297
9290/28840	By whom then were we beaten asked Porth	60.46424865722656
9291/28840	Yes but we have drowned Monsieur Mord	22.11618423461914
9292/28840	That is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at	40.88260269165039
9293/28840	But listen Porthos though Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised Mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning	33.87749099731445
9294/28840	We must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know	70.06664276123047
9295/28840	That is true said Porthos echoing DArtagnans	16.794082641601562
9296/28840	Well Porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good	72.8917007446289
9297/28840	But dont sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like	299.5768737792969
9298/28840	As to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first	87.94110870361328
9299/28840	How well you reason said Porthos admiring	59.35054397583008
9300/28840	Well yes pretty well replied DArtagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us	46.029319763183594
9301/28840	Well it is impossible but that Master Aramis that keenscented bloodhound and Athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our	53.038246154785156
9302/28840	Then believe me it will be time to	42.96811294555664
9303/28840	We can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at	72.48208618164062
9304/28840	What is that   Did you observe DArtagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton   No but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it so never	32.448734283447266
9305/28840	And then I feel the loss of my house tis a long time since I visited my	34.05965042114258
9306/28840	Forget them for a time we shall return to them unless Mazarin razes them to the	86.87724304199219
9307/28840	Do you think that likely   No the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk	69.59504699707031
9308/28840	Well then assume a cheerful manner as I do we must joke with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we cant corrupt	82.74573516845703
9309/28840	Try Porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our	30.148038864135742
9310/28840	Thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is Porthos the less attractive it	56.767486572265625
9311/28840	Ah I would give much to have five hundred louis	89.64400482177734
9312/28840	So would I said Porthos unwilling to be behind DArtagnan in generosity I would give as much as a hundred pist	35.72555160522461
9313/28840	The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when Comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and	46.16352844238281
9314/28840	I declare said Porthos I shall eat nothing if they do not take it	27.639162063598633
9315/28840	Remove the mutton cried Comminges I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup well more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his	38.663795471191406
9316/28840	No I am sorry to tell you he is perfectly	15.32713794708252
9317/28840	News in prison is a fruit so rare that I trust Monsieur de Comminges you will excuse my impatiencethe more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is	58.96605682373047

9319/28840	DArtagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the	49.9889030456543
9320/28840	Glad he cried I should be more than glad Happybeyond measure   Well I am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good	48.18211364746094
9321/28840	A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos If Athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long Athos will	131.40309143066406
9322/28840	Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea he	34.345611572265625
9323/28840	Do you say asked the Gascon timidly that the Comte de la Fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and myself   Yes	9.631532669067383
9324/28840	Then you have seen him   Certainly I	13.664098739624023
9325/28840	Where if I may ask without indisc	103.6918716430664
9326/28840	Near here replied De Comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you	63.60171127319336
9327/28840	He is wandering about the environs of the castle thought DArtagn	20.063697814941406
9328/28840	Then he said aloud   You met him I dare say in the parkhunting perhaps   No nearer nearer	54.872249603271484
9329/28840	Look behind this wall said De Comminges knocking against the	34.05390930175781
9330/28840	Behind this wall What is there then behind this wall I was brought here by night so devil take me if I know where I	73.68793487548828
9331/28840	Suppose there were a window in this	237.2332305908203
9332/28840	Well   From that window you would see Monsieur de la Fere at	22.07784652709961
9333/28840	The count then is in the chateau  	24.217548370361328
9334/28840	For what reason   The same as	80.54341125488281

9337/28840	Yesterday at Saint Germain as he came out from the presence of the	24.092205047607422
9338/28840	The arms of DArtagnan fell powerless by his	25.654401779174805
9339/28840	One might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared	93.89420318603516
9340/28840	Suddenly DArtagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than	27.476428985595703
9341/28840	Come come said Comminges who since DArtagnan on the day of Broussels arrest had saved him from the hands of the Parisians had entertained a real affection for him dont be unhappy I never thought of bringing you bad	35.93879699707031
9342/28840	Laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and Monsieur du Vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about	51.30866241455078
9343/28840	But DArtagnan was still in a desponding	18.367088317871094
9344/28840	And how did he look asked Porthos who perceiving that DArtagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or	27.845029830932617
9345/28840	A great favor Zounds Monsieur the Comte de la Fere whose family is allied to the Montmorency and the Rohan is easily the equal of Monsieur de Maz	18.615928649902344
9346/28840	No matter said DArtagnan in his most wheedling	14.94845199584961
9347/28840	On reflection my dear Du Vallon it is a great honor for the Comte de la Fere and gives good reason to	26.16509246826172
9348/28840	In fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that I think Monsieur de Comminges must be	23.4348087310791
9349/28840	What I am mistaken   Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit	6.789215564727783
9350/28840	No no no said Comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were I clearly understood what the cardinal said to	81.94554901123047
9351/28840	He will come and visit the Comte de la F	7.698729038238525
9352/28840	DArtagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether Porthos understood the importance of that visit but Porthos did not even look toward	18.263309478759766
9353/28840	It is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked DArtagn	29.635480880737305
9354/28840	Every evening he shuts himself in	393.1526184082031
9355/28840	That it seems is where he meditates on state	222.93418884277344
9356/28840	In that case said DArtagnan I begin to believe that Monsieur de la Fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an	16.08774185180664
9357/28840	And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers   The soldiers are Swiss who understand only	182.02769470214844
9358/28840	Besides according to all probability they will wait at the	48.39339065551758
9359/28840	DArtagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too	33.837825775146484
9360/28840	Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la Fere said DArtagnan for the count must be	16.610898971557617
9361/28840	Oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi The count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his	73.21031951904297
9362/28840	Two soldiers said DArtagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my	105.78921508789062
9363/28840	That is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for Bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes	38.24960708618164
9364/28840	Finelooking men upon my word said DArtagn	17.076120376586914
9365/28840	They belong to the regiment that was at Lens which the prince assigned to the	65.81063079833984
9366/28840	Ah monsieur said DArtagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur de la Fere our	27.18866539001465
9367/28840	I wish it with all my heart said Comm	27.819316864013672
9368/28840	Then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it   Not at	36.36826705932617
9369/28840	This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascons	67.1129150390625
9370/28840	Now said DArtagnan Ive one last favor to ask of you Monsieur de Comm	12.43571662902832
9371/28840	You will see the count again   Tomorrow	40.78692626953125
9372/28840	Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained   You want the cardinal to come here   No I know my place and am not so presumpt	52.96415710449219
9373/28840	Let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all I	26.74823570251465
9374/28840	Oh muttered Porthos shaking his head never should I have thought this of him How misfortune humbles a man   I promise you it shall be done answered De Comm	46.38840103149414
9375/28840	Tell the count that I am well that you found me sad but	171.30760192871094
9376/28840	I am pleased sir to hear	60.746761322021484
9377/28840	And the same also for Monsieur du Vallon   Not for me cried Porthos I am not by any means	22.76131248474121
9378/28840	But you will be resigned my	89.95272827148438
9379/28840	Never   He will become so monsieur I know him better than he knows	29.177644729614258
9380/28840	Be silent dear Du Vallon and resign	112.56768035888672
9381/28840	Adieu gentlemen said De Comminges sleep well   We will	47.8818244934082
9382/28840	De Comminges went away DArtagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be	29.221858978271484
9383/28840	Oh cried Porthos whats the matter now Have you gone mad my dear friend   What is the matter returned DArtagnan we are saved   I dont see that at all answered Porth	13.382269859313965
9384/28840	I think we are all taken prisoners except Aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarins mouset	78.52796173095703
9385/28840	Which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned DArtagn	41.33447265625
9386/28840	Never mind lets sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the	74.78705596923828
9387/28840	What are we to do then tonight   To travel	26.514774322509766
9388/28840	But   Sit down dear friend to	63.4620475769043
9389/28840	When one is eating ideas flow	1984.0074462890625
9390/28840	After supper when they are perfected I will communicate my plans to	71.84741973876953
9391/28840	So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by DArtagnans inventive	44.18281173706055
9392/28840	Supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of DArtagn	30.541479110717773
9393/28840	Not a scintilla of these was lost on Porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his	33.66447067260742
9394/28840	At dessert DArtagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his	61.674560546875
9395/28840	Porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at DArtagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfell	14.96783447265625
9396/28840	You were saying my dear friend   No I said	24.34844970703125
9397/28840	Yes you were saying you wished to leave this	27.625852584838867
9398/28840	Ah indeed the will was never	260.9416198730469
9399/28840	To get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a	178.0762481689453
9400/28840	Tis trueI said so and I say it	172.87179565429688
9401/28840	And I answered you Porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldnt go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend	40.4144172668457
9402/28840	That is true we should need clothes and	334.9486389160156
9403/28840	Well said DArtagnan rising we have them friend Porthos and even something	22.714326858520508
9404/28840	Useless to look everything will come to us when	443.278076171875
9405/28840	At about what time did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday   An hour after	68.94951629638672
9406/28840	If they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour   In a quarter of an hour at	27.796951293945312
9407/28840	Your arm is still strong enough is it not Porthos   Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary	31.564897537231445
9408/28840	Yes indeed said he I believe	51.59811782836914
9409/28840	So that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew  	43.285945892333984
9410/28840	And the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his	88.8879165649414
9411/28840	I used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at Pierrefonds and I have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my	62.231109619140625
9412/28840	Because your strength is not in your head Porthos said his	45.9493293762207
9413/28840	No it is in my arms and shoulders answered Porthos with gratified naive	39.6776237487793
9414/28840	Well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron	85.90576171875
9415/28840	Porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been	45.957523345947266
9416/28840	Well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done	92.6292495727539
9417/28840	Shall I take out any more of them asked Porth	50.01353073120117
9418/28840	No that is sufficient a man can pass through	95.7838134765625
9419/28840	Porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body	34.63711166381836
9420/28840	Now pass your arm through this	166.0103302001953
9421/28840	Why   You will know presentlypass	18.091949462890625
9422/28840	Porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the	23.22261619567871
9423/28840	Good What shall I do now  	31.029287338256836
9424/28840	It is finished then   No not	40.84455871582031
9425/28840	I should like to understand said Porth	16.221511840820312
9426/28840	Listen my dear friend in two words you will know	65.34611511230469
9427/28840	The door of the guardhouse opens as you	69.50163269042969
9428/28840	They are about to send into our court which Monsieur de Mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend	32.86956024169922
9429/28840	If only they close the guardhouse door Good They close	322.3681945800781
9430/28840	What then   Silence They may hear	108.4851303100586
9431/28840	And yet I should have preferred   You will have the pleasure of the	35.03702163696289
9432/28840	Hush   Porthos remained silent and motion	22.353425979614258
9433/28840	In fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of	85.3421630859375
9434/28840	At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned	25.61283302307129
9435/28840	Now said DArtagnan I am going to call this soldier and talk to	13.705293655395508
9436/28840	Dont lose a word of what Im going to say to you Porth	20.820234298706055
9437/28840	Good the execution of plots is my for	768.71484375
9438/28840	Look I shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to	42.68039321899414
9439/28840	But supposing he doesnt mount   He will rely upon	49.88766860961914
9440/28840	As soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the	47.65532302856445
9441/28840	Then raising him up as Tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he cant cry	94.24029541015625
9442/28840	Suppose I happen to strangle him   To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world but you will not do so I	39.59321594238281
9443/28840	Lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomew	206.84600830078125
9444/28840	So we shall get from him one uniform and a	69.72818756103516
9445/28840	Marvelous exclaimed Porthos looking at the Gascon with the most profound	15.732828140258789
9446/28840	Yes said Porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for	42.268226623535156
9447/28840	Therefore when I cough stretch out your	90.93185424804688
9448/28840	Good   The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed Porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the	24.125640869140625
9449/28840	Goodevening comrade said DArtagnan in his most fascinating voice and	34.14497756958008
9450/28840	Goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial	91.2452392578125
9451/28840	Tis not too warm to walk resumed DArtagn	32.20756530761719
9452/28840	And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you   A glass of wine will be extremely	22.536535263061523
9453/28840	The fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the Gascon to Porth	98.72611999511719
9454/28840	A bottle perhaps   A whole bottle Yes	282.5089111328125
9455/28840	A whole bottle if you will drink my	182.1781768798828
9456/28840	Come then and take it friend said the Gas	35.94879913330078
9457/28840	How convenient that theres a bench	312.50689697265625
9458/28840	Egad one would think it had been placed here on	126.01422119140625
9459/28840	That instant the arm of Porthos	68.97943878173828
9460/28840	His hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincers the soldiers	117.55870056152344
9461/28840	He raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the	60.34788131713867
9462/28840	Then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two	49.44126892089844
9463/28840	Heres a sword and a dress said Porth	39.69436264038086
9464/28840	I take them said DArtagnan for	19.27465057373047
9465/28840	If you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over	128.3977813720703
9466/28840	Stop I see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward	120.01666259765625
9467/28840	I think replied Porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruin	38.22012710571289
9468/28840	No I will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready g	53.667999267578125
9469/28840	Be ready said Porthos as he slipped through the	33.662113189697266
9470/28840	Porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after	63.84543228149414
9471/28840	Then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of	59.16021728515625
9472/28840	This operation proved as great a success as the	383.82318115234375
9473/28840	There said DArtagnan this is capital Now let me try on the dress of yonder	27.739591598510742
9474/28840	Porthos I doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red	45.69687271118164
9475/28840	It happened however that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted Porthos	88.33911895751953
9476/28840	Tis done they both exclaimed at	206.4995880126953
9477/28840	As to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead	58.7094841003418
9478/28840	The soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of Porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against	52.87152862548828
9479/28840	Now said DArtagnan you wouldnt be sorry to understand the plot would you Porthos   Well no not	24.72012710571289
9480/28840	Well then we shall go down into the	22.590164184570312
9481/28840	We shall take the place of those two	61.290592193603516
9482/28840	Well   We will walk back and	75.14129638671875
9483/28840	Thats a good idea for it isnt	165.2590789794922
9484/28840	In a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day	25.290700912475586
9485/28840	And we shall answer   No on the contrary we shall not	17.178911209106445
9486/28840	As you please I dont insist on	151.87197875976562
9487/28840	We will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his em	31.794160842895508
9488/28840	Where shall we escort him   Where he is goingto visit Ath	59.64207077026367
9489/28840	Do you think Athos will be sorry to see us   Oh cried Porthos oh I	15.51518726348877
9490/28840	Wait a little Porthos before crying out for on my word you havent reached the end said the Gascon in a jesting	32.263099670410156
9491/28840	The man who lives to see shall	99.2594223022461
9492/28840	And slipping through the aperture he alighted in the	39.75227355957031
9493/28840	Porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less	40.147300720214844
9494/28840	They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the	69.8894271850586
9495/28840	Where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the	35.24467849731445
9496/28840	What say you to that Monsieur du Vallon he added in a low tone to Porth	10.946407318115234
9497/28840	If it but lasts most capital responded Porth	131.47711181640625
9498/28840	Do you hearnot a single creature Obey that person	255.20425415039062
9499/28840	On your return you cannot make a	82.73065948486328
9500/28840	You have only to wait here till I release	69.5583267211914
9501/28840	DArtagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than Bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the Gascon a dozen times to the	13.217557907104492
9502/28840	The Gascon therefore instead of answering growled out Ja Ja in the most German and the least Gascon accent	57.95438003540039
9503/28840	As for Porthos on whom DArtagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos he was simply	27.377910614013672
9504/28840	All that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial Der Teufel   Bernouin shut the door and went	37.68185806274414
9505/28840	When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for	60.318363189697266
9506/28840	Porthos my friend said DArtagnan dont distrust Providence Let me meditate and	31.622045516967773
9507/28840	Meditate and consider as much as you like replied Porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this	55.06510925292969
9508/28840	We have walked eight paces whispered DArtagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orang	52.1757926940918
9509/28840	The Comte de la Fere cannot be far off only the doors are	47.49863815307617
9510/28840	That is a slight difficulty said Porthos and a good push with the shoulders   For Gods sake Porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they	48.676692962646484
9511/28840	Have you not heard that some one is coming here  	37.65656661987305
9512/28840	Well that some one will open the	43.33345413208008
9513/28840	But my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you dont propose I imagine that I shall kill that man of the	86.62350463867188
9514/28840	That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or	106.56067657470703
9515/28840	Oh may God keep me from it and you too said DArtagn	30.017553329467773
9516/28840	The young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to	45.354312896728516
9517/28840	And then besides the useless blood never no never I have my plan let me carry it out and we shall	211.00242614746094
9518/28840	So much the better said Porthos I feel some need of	23.192764282226562
9519/28840	Hush said DArtagnan the some one is	43.98086166381836
9520/28840	The sound of a light step was heard in the vestib	45.62004089355469
9521/28840	The hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his	28.364580154418945
9522/28840	Porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern   Light the lamp which hangs from the	32.12630081176758
9523/28840	Then addressing DArtagnan   You know the watchword he	25.6070556640625
9524/28840	Ja replied the Gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German	64.30296325683594
9525/28840	And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he	27.188854217529297
9526/28840	Now asked Porthos what are we to do   Now we shall make use of your shoulder friend Porthos if this door proves to be	22.27947425842285
9527/28840	Everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait	87.61016845703125
9528/28840	But first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder caval	107.8113784790039
9529/28840	The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open	71.34274291992188
9530/28840	There said DArtagnan we cant be overt	11.938969612121582
9531/28840	The bolt gave way and the door	139.1098175048828
9532/28840	As I told you everything can be attained Porthos women and doors by proceeding with gent	87.69538879394531
9533/28840	Youre a great moralist and thats the fact said Porth	52.34385299682617
9534/28840	Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it	72.02545166015625
9535/28840	DArtagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding	22.989486694335938
9536/28840	He called Porthos to look at	19.50592803955078
9537/28840	Were our object money only he said we should be rich	198.56455993652344
9538/28840	It would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said Porth	36.342430114746094
9539/28840	So I think and therefore I said Were our object money only but we want something else replied the Gas	85.00032043457031
9540/28840	At the same moment whilst DArtagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the	36.04159164428711
9541/28840	Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong	82.19577026367188
9542/28840	Faith he said in Italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith theres enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in	108.47623443603516
9543/28840	I am a great captainthat I am but I make war in my own	34.68799591064453
9544/28840	The two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side	68.1971664428711
9545/28840	Mazarin came within three steps of DArtagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its	72.89163208007812
9546/28840	Then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern Now he said for Monsieur de la F	22.615373611450195
9547/28840	Very good thought DArtagnan tis our road likewise we will go	30.297460556030273
9548/28840	All three set off on their walk Mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side	176.05113220214844
9549/28840	The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of	87.72838592529297
9550/28840	He then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in	36.44432067871094
9551/28840	Ah Diavolo he exclaimed I forgot the recommendation of De Comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that fourheaded combination of	45.785423278808594
9552/28840	And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his	27.358327865600586
9553/28840	Do not give yourself the trouble my lord said DArtagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we	37.277339935302734
9554/28840	And he made the same friendly salute as DArtagn	26.84927749633789
9555/28840	Mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of	84.83702087402344
9556/28840	DArtagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been	39.00874710083008
9557/28840	Oh what imprudence my lord said DArtagnan tis not good to be about just here without a	29.691421508789062
9558/28840	Your eminence might knock against something or fall into a	151.85337829589844
9559/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan muttered Mazarin unable to recover from his aston	12.12622356414795
9560/28840	I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du Vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself	18.307628631591797
9561/28840	And DArtagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole	30.608251571655273
9562/28840	You were going to visit Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagn	5.682085990905762
9563/28840	Be so good as to show us the way and we will follow	21.95676612854004
9564/28840	Mazarin was by degrees recovering his	776.0150146484375
9565/28840	Have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his	69.58728790283203
9566/28840	Porthos opened his mouth to reply DArtagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually	26.483234405517578
9567/28840	This moment come my lord said DArtagn	17.33075714111328
9568/28840	His fears were now no longer for his hoard but for	183.31307983398438
9569/28840	A sort of smile played on his	72.75321960449219
9570/28840	Come he said you have me in a snare	25.304248809814453
9571/28840	You wish to ask for liberty andI give it	97.36245727539062
9572/28840	Oh my lord answered DArtagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of	22.032798767089844
9573/28840	You have your liberty repeated Mazarin in	245.69473266601562
9574/28840	Certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back	34.75934982299805
9575/28840	Mazarin felt a shiver run through hima chill even to his hearts	294.5138854980469
9576/28840	His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon and the unchanging countenance of Porth	26.824617385864258
9577/28840	Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read	48.667755126953125
9578/28840	To purchase back my liberty said the	247.72105407714844
9579/28840	And how much will that cost me Monsieur dArtagnan   Zounds my lord I dont know	13.00494384765625
9580/28840	We must ask the Comte de la Fere the	16.573915481567383
9581/28840	Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the counts room and in ten minutes all will be	22.396129608154297
9582/28840	Be assured answered Mazarin that I shall attempt nothing I give you my word of	37.003570556640625
9583/28840	DArtagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to Mazarin   Now my lord let us enter if you	11.275670051574707
9584/28840	Mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice Comminges had given	91.84602355957031
9585/28840	Your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of	40.95463943481445
9586/28840	And so my dear count said DArtagnan his eminence didnt actually insist on our attending him it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see	42.53433609008789
9587/28840	At that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone Athos made a bound of	140.47000122070312
9588/28840	Ah my lord cried the Gascon dont threaten tis a bad	29.547170639038086
9589/28840	We are so good and gentle to your em	27.160173416137695
9590/28840	Come let us put aside all rancor and talk	49.98160171508789
9591/28840	Theres nothing I wish more replied Maz	135.29058837890625
9592/28840	But dont think yourselves in a better position than you	63.46199035644531
9593/28840	In ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap	109.22551727294922
9594/28840	How are you to get away from here remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these	59.64522933959961
9595/28840	Now I am going to show you how sincere I	22.46803092956543
9596/28840	Good thought DArtagnan we must look about us hes going to play us a	53.194862365722656
9597/28840	I offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it Before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like	87.49281311035156
9598/28840	And like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his	169.65542602539062
9599/28840	And therefore said DArtagnan to clip the hope which Athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to Mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extrem	41.15382385253906
9600/28840	If on the contrary resumed Mazarin you accept your liberty   Why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it away from	40.160099029541016
9601/28840	You do not believe me   My lord I never believe cardinals who are not	48.56645584106445
9602/28840	Well on the faith of a	93.75251770019531
9603/28840	You are no longer a minister my lord you are a	31.468278884887695
9604/28840	Then on the honor of a Mazarin as I am and ever shall be I hope said the	31.71965789794922
9605/28840	I have heard speak of a Mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in	73.56593322753906
9606/28840	I fear he may have been an ancestor of your em	36.04185104370117
9607/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan you are a great wit and I am really sorry to be on bad terms with	11.413091659545898
9608/28840	My lord let us come to terms I ask nothing	181.93934631347656
9609/28840	Very well said Mazarin if I place you in security in a manner evident palpable   Ah that is another thing said Porth	25.485023498535156
9610/28840	In the first place do you accept asked the	54.710262298583984
9611/28840	Unfold your plan my lord and we will	114.50028228759766
9612/28840	Take notice that you are shut upcapt	245.3306427001953
9613/28840	You well know my lord that there always remains to us a last	67.85440826416016
9614/28840	What   That of dying	122.82218170166016
9615/28840	Listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which I have the key it leads into the	33.596797943115234
9616/28840	Go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have	50.037044525146484
9617/28840	At a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and	41.59115982055664
9618/28840	Ah by Jove my lord said DArtagnan you have well said but these are only	29.547714233398438
9619/28840	Where is the key you speak of   Here it	44.1130485534668
9620/28840	Ah my lord You will conduct us yourself then to that door   Very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and Mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the	32.13896560668945
9621/28840	It led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their	37.00830841064453
9622/28840	The devil exclaimed the Gascon tis a dreadful night my	33.128726959228516
9623/28840	We dont know the locality and shall never find the	100.32219696044922
9624/28840	Since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the	101.13570404052734
9625/28840	Be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same	39.384212493896484
9626/28840	I think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were	26.235807418823242
9627/28840	Deuce take it three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church Ah apropos my lord you remarked that we were all active vigorous and	58.981441497802734
9628/28840	Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are	19.233566284179688
9629/28840	The count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend	64.36717224121094
9630/28840	Where can we find another sword asked Porth	51.61441421508789
9631/28840	My lord said DArtagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the Comte de la F	18.075971603393555
9632/28840	Willingly said the cardinal I will even ask the count to keep it for my	79.07958221435547
9633/28840	I promise you my lord never to part with it replied Ath	28.269744873046875
9634/28840	Well well cried DArtagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes Porthos   Yes said Porthos but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep I think it is the	22.372486114501953
9635/28840	Now climb up Athos quickly said DArtagn	40.62744140625
9636/28840	Athos assisted by Porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the	28.063312530517578
9637/28840	Athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the	33.2820930480957
9638/28840	Are you on the ground asked DArtagn	9.486912727355957
9639/28840	Without accident   Perfectly safe and	142.9303436279297
9640/28840	Porthos whilst I get up watch the	82.23348236083984
9641/28840	No I dont want your help watch the	100.2359390258789
9642/28840	Well   You are right it is more difficult than I	14.960680961608887
9643/28840	Lend me your backbut dont let the cardinal	254.9832305908203
9644/28840	Porthos lent him his back and DArtagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated	17.352266311645508
9645/28840	Yes my friend and now   Now what asked Porth	32.28084182739258
9646/28840	Now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle	94.40257263183594
9647/28840	You are free he said through me your liberty was my	238.7176055908203
9648/28840	Porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the	44.53740692138672
9649/28840	I didnt understand it all he said but I understand now how droll it is   You think so so much the better but that it may prove laughterworthy even to the end let us not lose	37.242950439453125
9650/28840	Attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said DArtagnan for myself I will reconnoit	30.590057373046875
9651/28840	The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant	124.34329223632812

9653/28840	Along the wall sir said Mazarin there will be no danger of losing	56.85976028442383
9654/28840	The three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the	56.41923522949219
9655/28840	The cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do	56.426177978515625
9656/28840	Suddenly DArtagnan touched something warm which	37.6208610534668
9657/28840	Stop a horse he cried I have found a horse   And I likewise said Ath	33.2626953125
9658/28840	I too said Porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals	46.99579620361328
9659/28840	Theres luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to	66.64839172363281
9660/28840	Is Aramis here   Yes sir he has been here since	32.0280876159668
9661/28840	What are you doing   On the watch   What Aramis here cried Ath	20.403438568115234

9663/28840	Are you a large party   S	48.20894241333008
9664/28840	And believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself Grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his	89.94359588623047
9665/28840	There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Maz	47.805389404296875
9666/28840	Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron and DArtagnan a	58.85105514526367
9667/28840	At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten	49.40616226196289
9668/28840	He was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends	81.79779052734375
9669/28840	You are free my brothers free without my aid and I shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my	49.39423370361328
9670/28840	Do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied Ath	64.02942657470703
9671/28840	I had well concerted my plans pursued Aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from Rueil to Saint Germain twenty are dispersed in the	59.63493728637695
9672/28840	Thus I was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from Mazarin to the	48.74190902709961
9673/28840	In the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to Melun since Rueil seemed to him not sufficiently	92.31529998779297
9674/28840	You can understand dear friend with what hope I was inspired by that last	229.57237243652344
9675/28840	I placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men I encircled the castle the riding horses I entrusted to Grimaud and I awaited your coming out which I did not expect till tomorrow and I didnt hope to free you without a skirm	59.2068977355957
9676/28840	You are free tonight without fighting so much the better How did you manage to escape that scoundrel Mazarin You must have much reason to complain of	46.855045318603516
9677/28840	Really   I might even say that we have some reason to praise	33.79070281982422
9678/28840	Impossible   Yes really it is owing to him that we are	36.70308303833008
9679/28840	Owing to him   Yes he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin his valetdechambre and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de la F	18.856599807739258
9680/28840	Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted	118.61593627929688
9681/28840	He even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with Grim	60.40010070800781
9682/28840	Well exclaimed Aramis this will reconcile me to him but I wish he were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so noble an	34.35200881958008
9683/28840	My lord said DArtagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the Chevalier dHerblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your em	21.755640029907227
9684/28840	And he retired discovering Mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of Aram	40.4052848815918
9685/28840	Ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize Halloo halloo friends to horse to horse   Several horsemen ran quickly to	81.67034149169922
9686/28840	I think it will be wise to set off said DArtagn	10.06631851196289
9687/28840	Yes but I am expecting some one a friend of Ath	40.17412185668945
9688/28840	And here he comes by Jupiter galloping through the	68.1015396118164
9689/28840	The count the count cried a young voice that made Athos	89.69342803955078
9690/28840	For one moment the young man forgot his habitual respecthe threw himself on his fathers	66.98413848876953
9691/28840	He will indeed give us the favor of his company you will I hope be grateful for it Porthos do not lose sight of his em	30.64189910888672
9692/28840	Aramis then joined Athos and DArtagnan who were consulting	16.41333770751953
9693/28840	Come said DArtagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our	18.317569732666016
9694/28840	Where are we to go asked Porth	21.601032257080078
9695/28840	Come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you	33.0363655090332
9696/28840	The chances of war said Athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of	73.425048828125
9697/28840	No but we shall make use of them said DArtagn	10.13144302368164
9698/28840	The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former	58.11640930175781
9699/28840	Mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phant	113.88970947265625
9700/28840	At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell	207.1501007080078
9701/28840	Horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed Porthos everything degener	115.63136291503906
9702/28840	I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin said Aram	22.15631103515625
9703/28840	He is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for	54.83390426635742
9704/28840	We at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us	84.87691497802734
9705/28840	Once beyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to	62.035892486572266
9706/28840	Grimaud in fact brought back five	1187.6507568359375
9707/28840	The nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of Porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend	50.37649154663086
9708/28840	Ten minutes later the escort stopped at Ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding Mazarin	85.93846130371094
9709/28840	At noon they rode into the avenue of Pierref	60.06761932373047
9710/28840	We are four of us said DArtagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a	42.206138610839844
9711/28840	Athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege Porthos will see to the provisions and Aramis to the troops of the	37.40620803833008
9712/28840	That is to say Athos will be chief engineer Porthos purveyoringeneral and Aramis governor of the	43.6396598815918
9713/28840	Meanwhile they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chate	54.66634750366211
9714/28840	Gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect I presume to keep me here a long time incognito   No my lord replied the Gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you	36.457454681396484
9715/28840	And what shall you do   Defend	44.722694396972656
9716/28840	Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole	72.18921661376953
9717/28840	Such feats sir are done onceand never	2279.834716796875
9718/28840	However nowadays theres no need of so much	82.32434844970703
9719/28840	Tomorrow the army of Paris will be summoned the day after it will be here The field of battle instead therefore of being at Saint Denis or at Charenton will be near Compiegne or VillarsCottere	30.994632720947266
9720/28840	The prince will vanquish you as he has always	52.586917877197266
9721/28840	Tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend Du Vallon who has	57.767486572265625
9722/28840	We will not expose your eminence to the chances of	27.167049407958984
9723/28840	Come answered Mazarin I see it will be necessary for me to capit	43.91102600097656
9724/28840	Before a siege   Yes the conditions will be better than	88.98710632324219
9725/28840	Ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are   Come now what are your conditions   Rest yourself first my lord and wewe will	67.69210815429688
9726/28840	I do not need rest gentlemen I need to know whether I am among enemies or	53.36266326904297
9727/28840	Friends my lord friends   Well then tell me at once what you want that I may see if any arrangement be	53.802146911621094
9728/28840	Speak Comte de la Fere   My lord replied Athos for myself I have nothing to	18.80694580078125
9729/28840	For France were I to specify my wishes I should have too	93.85181427001953
9730/28840	I beg you to excuse me and propose to the cheval	13.448956489562988
9731/28840	And Athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the	56.211849212646484
9732/28840	What do you want Nothing ambiguous if you	27.676715850830078
9733/28840	As for me replied Aramis I have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which I formed onewent yesterday to Saint Germain to impose on	50.816192626953125
9734/28840	Let us consider first the ancient	1051.915771484375
9735/28840	The demands in that programme must be	210.74429321289062
9736/28840	We were almost agreed on those replied Mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stip	88.68415069580078
9737/28840	You suppose then that there are some said Aramis	129.76275634765625
9738/28840	I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as Monsieur de la Fere replied the cardinal bowing to Ath	16.091999053955078
9739/28840	My lord you are right and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at	27.772985458374023
9740/28840	The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly	214.22508239746094
9741/28840	He is a proud soulhe is a man by himself You are righthe is worth us all and we avow it to you   Aramis said Athos are you jesting   No no dear friend I state only what we all	45.51304244995117
9742/28840	You are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant	129.9912872314453
9743/28840	Well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited   I require my lord that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full abs	24.48586654663086
9744/28840	I require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the	45.91065979003906
9745/28840	That is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit France and be an	75.19043731689453
9746/28840	I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my	61.78588104248047
9747/28840	Mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to DArtagn	32.42738723754883
9748/28840	I my lord answered the Gascon I differ from Monsieur dHerblay entirely as to the last point though I agree with him on the	23.37334632873535
9749/28840	Far from wishing my lord to quit Paris I hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great states	39.703609466552734
9750/28840	I shall try also to help him to down the Fronde but on one conditionthat he sometimes remembers the kings faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could	62.796974182128906
9751/28840	And you Monsieur du Vallon   Yes you sir Speak if you please said Maz	15.760120391845703
9752/28840	You know sir that before receiving the order one must submit	431.1014099121094
9753/28840	Besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be	55.273963928222656
9754/28840	Mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly   All this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if I satisfy some I shall displease	125.73817443847656
9755/28840	True said Aramis so as I am in a minority I withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and monseigneurs	56.593997955322266
9756/28840	I am to remain minister then said Maz	39.29540252685547
9757/28840	You remain minister that is understood said DArtagnan France needs	62.92406463623047
9758/28840	And I desist from my pretensions said Aram	257.5252990722656
9759/28840	His eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for	47.87576675415039
9760/28840	Occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let France settle matters as she will with me resumed Maz	187.41778564453125
9761/28840	The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queens consent to	49.259822845458984
9762/28840	I can answer only for myself said Maz	52.52052688598633
9763/28840	Suppose her majesty refuses   Oh said DArtagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him	27.680912017822266
9764/28840	Here monseigneur said Aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of Fronde	23.088951110839844
9765/28840	Will your eminence please read and examine   I am acquainted with	105.4732894897461
9766/28840	Reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by	232.41177368164062
9767/28840	Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely	68.12505340576172
9768/28840	Suppose I refuse   Then said DArtagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a	49.98545837402344
9769/28840	Would you dare to touch a cardinal   You have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musket	36.949851989746094
9770/28840	I do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to Paris and the Parisians will defend	35.589630126953125
9771/28840	How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain said Aram	30.420116424560547
9772/28840	Sign the treaty then monseigneur said Aram	27.040231704711914
9773/28840	Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it   Ah nonsense cried DArtagnan I can manage so that her majesty will receive me well I know an excellent	49.39634323120117
9774/28840	What   I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are	33.86896514892578
9775/28840	When I see her majesty embarrassed I shall conduct her to Rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a	58.50386047363281
9776/28840	Enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty   Here it is replied Aram	30.51661491394043
9777/28840	Sign my lord and he gave him a	26.35102653503418
9778/28840	Mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not de	1245.99169921875
9779/28840	And when I have signed he said what is to be my guarantee   My word of honor sir said Ath	32.411373138427734
9780/28840	Mazarin started turned toward the Comte de la Fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the	64.4354019165039
9781/28840	It is sufficient count he said and signed the	225.36241149902344
9782/28840	And now Monsieur dArtagnan he said prepare to set off for Saint Germain and take a letter from me to the	15.933826446533203

9785/28840	He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to Chantilly so that he might be in Paris in five or six	65.65851593017578
9786/28840	But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind	72.3372802734375
9787/28840	In fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission Athos for generosity is a hero of romance Porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced Aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illeg	46.8050537109375
9788/28840	What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them The deliverance of the cardinal	53.95928192138672
9789/28840	Now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of Hercules were pyg	48.14380645751953

9792/28840	Mistrust Porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as God on earth will assist him in contriving Mazarins escape if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chival	79.25440979003906
9793/28840	Aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and res	70.46434783935547

9797/28840	He pressed Aramiss hand and went in search of Porth	41.643131256103516
9798/28840	What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go   Why I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so	39.16427993774414
9799/28840	Bravo Porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this Mazarin would have you	76.720458984375
9800/28840	Do you think so   I am sure of	7.868167877197266
9801/28840	Then I would kill him rather than let him	38.407012939453125
9802/28840	There is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the Frondeurs who besides dont understand political matters as we old soldiers	108.8351821899414

9808/28840	I have only one thing to say to	11.2267484664917
9809/28840	You know Anne of Austria the captivity of Mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go I am a dead	52.14442825317383
9810/28840	I needed nothing less than that consideration my dear DArtagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jail	45.878177642822266
9811/28840	I give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave	24.551734924316406
9812/28840	This reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought DArtagn	41.67463684082031
9813/28840	Now that I have the word of Athos I can set	31.754016876220703
9814/28840	DArtagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission to the queens	30.94140625
9815/28840	Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at Saint Germ	28.925378799438477
9816/28840	The disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally	68.10735321044922
9817/28840	Anne of Austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every	86.38999938964844
9818/28840	In the chamber of DArtagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and g	17.46653175354004
9819/28840	On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and	90.07857513427734
9820/28840	But as to what had been done by Porthos and DArtagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chate	15.915632247924805
9821/28840	Bernouin alone knew a little more than the	116.24417877197266
9822/28840	Bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orang	66.49614715576172
9823/28840	The first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that	107.79035949707031
9824/28840	Then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of Athoss chamber and that of the	41.98130416870117
9825/28840	From the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the	109.16313934326172
9826/28840	He saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of Engh	38.8448371887207
9827/28840	He could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to Saint Germain to warn the queen of that	23.1099796295166
9828/28840	Now since DArtagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint Germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any	20.38018798828125
9829/28840	On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished	71.19786834716797
9830/28840	At the sight of DArtagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be	16.445531845092773
9831/28840	But DArtagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his	13.354222297668457
9832/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep Monsieur dArtagnan   Himself Monsieur Bernou	11.546188354492188
9833/28840	And why have you come here   To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarinthe freshest news there	19.075986862182617
9834/28840	What has become of him then   He is as well as you and	13.616555213928223
9835/28840	Nothing bad has happened to him then   Absolutely	115.83251953125
9836/28840	He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de France and begged usthe Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallonto accompany	30.531309127807617
9837/28840	We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that	164.23162841796875
9838/28840	We set out last evening and here we	82.4127197265625
9839/28840	His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and privatea mission that could be confided only to a sure manand so has sent me to Saint Germ	62.712318420410156
9840/28840	And therefore my dear Monsieur Bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that I have come and tell her with what	26.609914779663086
9841/28840	DArtagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinals letter   It was however merely a letter of	31.675689697265625
9842/28840	The queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for	99.79474639892578
9843/28840	DArtagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on	47.539642333984375
9844/28840	The queen as he went on looked at him with increasing aston	23.739973068237305
9845/28840	She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish	53.16404342651367
9846/28840	There is here no question of crime or	141.8778533935547
9847/28840	Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison Monsieur du Vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles	27.50682830810547
9848/28840	brotherinlaw of the late king your husband the consort of Madame Henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal	58.31193923950195
9849/28840	We were then convinced my friend and I that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and	52.513126373291016
9850/28840	Now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and	116.58445739746094
9851/28840	We have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an	31.92302131652832
9852/28840	Well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a	95.73637390136719
9853/28840	We were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the Louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a	71.0833511352539
9854/28840	That proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully	171.73715209960938
9855/28840	I listen to you and I wonder at you sir said the	27.79994773864746
9856/28840	In fact I have rarely seen such excess of imp	123.52286529541016
9857/28840	Your majesty on your side said DArtagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always	28.307209014892578
9858/28840	You are in error sir answered the	59.01553726196289
9859/28840	I am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour I shall set off at the head of my army to release my	34.914791107177734
9860/28840	I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous	27.62150001525879
9861/28840	Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should I find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all I could to induce you to change your	70.53211975097656
9862/28840	Well then I will content myself with arresting you   Madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should I not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to Paris and delivered to the	28.608686447143555
9863/28840	Your pardon madame I know all	63.06064224243164
9864/28840	And therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort nor to De Bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to DElbe	16.69892120361328
9865/28840	These gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good	55.118858337402344
9866/28840	He will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole	35.36207580566406
9867/28840	I think returned Anne of Austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans face would have expressed disdain but in a queens spread terror to those she looked upon nay I perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your	91.36618041992188
9868/28840	Madame replied DArtagnan I threaten simply and solely because I am obliged to do	24.052236557006836
9869/28840	What am I A poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which I have sought so long rests on me for a	87.2468032836914
9870/28840	Look at the Comte de la Fere a type of nobility a flower of ch	19.50259780883789
9871/28840	He has taken part against his queen or rather against her	110.2938232421875
9872/28840	He has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to	14.266524314880371
9873/28840	Look at Monsieur du Vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in	83.13219451904297
9874/28840	Why did you not say all this before you took action sir she	98.19549560546875
9875/28840	Because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubtedthat is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your	56.45887756347656
9876/28840	And that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what I	110.56405639648438
9877/28840	I ought muttered Anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are	111.51063537597656
9878/28840	Alas madame exclaimed DArtagnan this proves to me that not till today has your majesty had a just idea of	65.3769760131836
9879/28840	Perhaps said Anne but that idea if at last I have it   Your majesty will do us	41.69096755981445
9880/28840	In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar	93.85319519042969
9881/28840	You will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his	147.4805450439453
9882/28840	Where is the treaty   Here it	21.20669174194336
9883/28840	Anne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that DArtagnan presented to	35.18740463256836
9884/28840	We do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great	199.90809631347656
9885/28840	It is my intention so to do come let us hear	99.73471069335938
9886/28840	Tis the appointment Monsieur de Tréville held you ask of	36.537784576416016
9887/28840	The place madame is vacant and although tis a year since Monsieur de Tréville has left it it has not been	38.30315017700195
9888/28840	But it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings	26.1837215423584
9889/28840	Monsieur de Tréville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty	46.31267166137695
9890/28840	You have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and	76.57306671142578
9891/28840	Undoubtedly madame said DArtagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office	58.87842559814453
9892/28840	What more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her	38.95819854736328
9893/28840	A hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your	36.54545974731445
9894/28840	Nay it must have been a	85.87521362304688
9895/28840	A country clown said Anne of Austria people will	275.7842712402344
9896/28840	But I am sure of one thingthat those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second	48.526283264160156
9897/28840	said the queen she signed a	296.0049743652344
9898/28840	Now there remains the chevalier or the Abbé dHerblay as your majesty ple	12.716147422790527
9899/28840	Does he wish to be a bishop   No madame something easier to	44.97360610961914
9900/28840	What   It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of Madame de Longue	11.279194831848145
9901/28840	Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood madame said DArtagn	13.597973823547363
9902/28840	Yes said the queen but his son   His son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother	52.25013732910156
9903/28840	And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville   No madame for I presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of	33.636199951171875
9904/28840	As to the government of Normandy replied the queen I think I can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal	33.28761291503906
9905/28840	We shall search for some madame and I think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some	42.40884017944336

9911/28840	What is he then   The Comte de la Fere is a demig	8.770803451538086
9912/28840	If that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say   Perhaps he would	55.49185562133789
9913/28840	Perhaps   Yes if your majesty herself should beg him to	51.6015510559082
9914/28840	He must be indeed a strange	67.19822692871094
9915/28840	Well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg	53.038326263427734
9916/28840	Are you satisfied sir   There is one thing the queen has not signedher assent to the	49.925907135009766
9917/28840	Of what use today I will sign it	158.91741943359375
9918/28840	I can assure her majesty that if she does not sign today she will not have time to sign	31.044307708740234
9919/28840	Consent then I beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by Mazarin as you see   I consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the Paris	30.602632522583008
9920/28840	Anne was caught she could not draw backshe signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to	74.44200897216797
9921/28840	Since that period of history queens have shed tears like other	622.3515014648438

9924/28840	He begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to	88.6087417602539
9925/28840	He has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his	71.38256072998047
9926/28840	And in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore Monsieur de Mazarin to your majesty without	75.39119720458984
9927/28840	Behold madame here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep	32.67136764526367
9928/28840	And DArtagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in Annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much	77.41947174072266

9931/28840	He was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be	62.96133804321289
9932/28840	There are the acts signed I deliver them to you without	240.28665161132812

9936/28840	Madame said DArtagnan rising I have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall bemy	31.753517150878906
9937/28840	And with this conclusiona way peculiar to himselfhe rose and left the	90.89859771728516
9938/28840	I never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of	50.67863845825195
9939/28840	In twentyfour hours DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of	24.018884658813477
9940/28840	On the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest	33.241493225097656
9941/28840	Here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty   Monsieur de Conti received Damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made	80.60546112060547
9942/28840	Moreover something had been said of a marriage with Mazarins	67.56505584716797
9943/28840	The idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some	52.32382583618164
9944/28840	The Duc de Beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his	52.81629180908203
9945/28840	Full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his	76.31298828125
9946/28840	He received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the Duc de Vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the Parliament of Bret	37.31940460205078

10037/28840	I think I should like the other fellow better than this one said Mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his	26.905967712402344
10038/28840	The queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel	56.78573989868164
10039/28840	The crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be	84.2251968383789
10040/28840	Reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming stormand when they pass athwart a multitude presage an eme	212.07546997070312
10041/28840	DArtagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the	26.797576904296875
10042/28840	The ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to	170.2113800048828

10045/28840	An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken	312.8656311035156
10046/28840	Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the	56.89960479736328
10047/28840	Onward cried DArtagnan in a loud	26.149484634399414
10048/28840	But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded	62.937538146972656
10049/28840	Cries of Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal resounded on all	28.130172729492188
10050/28840	At the same time through the streets of Grenelle Saint Honore and Du Coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthoss horse and that of DArtagn	26.675596237182617
10051/28840	This new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed	47.05115509033203
10052/28840	It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized	37.402042388916016
10053/28840	Each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a	42.23542022705078
10054/28840	Both were evidently stimulated by the same	51.192787170410156
10055/28840	There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal	114.08065032958984
10056/28840	Myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns	40.92970657348633
10057/28840	One of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the	32.929134368896484
10058/28840	One went to support DArtagnan the other Porth	27.395578384399414
10059/28840	Then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were	115.31871795654297
10060/28840	Like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was	137.84605407714844
10061/28840	The musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give	47.244564056396484
10062/28840	DArtagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying   No sir I wish to see	17.317039489746094
10063/28840	If your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied DArtagn	70.52882385253906
10064/28840	And turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musket	45.64075469970703
10065/28840	Zounds give way   At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too	35.67500305175781

10068/28840	What the devil are you doing here count   Accomplishing my destiny replied Rochefort falling on one	25.575159072875977

10070/28840	Count said DArtagnan with some degree of emotion I struck without knowing that it was	27.555625915527344
10071/28840	I am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward	57.63445281982422
10072/28840	Rochefort extended his hand to DArtagnan who took	48.22333908081055
10073/28840	The count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled	89.7729721069336
10074/28840	He stiffened in the last convulsions of death and	44.415157318115234
10075/28840	Back people cried DArtagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business	29.756420135498047
10076/28840	Indeed as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him	42.20148849487305
10077/28840	DArtagnan returned to help Porthos if Porthos needed help but Porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as DArtagn	20.520376205444336
10078/28840	The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to	53.00469970703125
10079/28840	What a devil of a face you have Porthos and what a strange air for a victor   But you answered Porthos seem to me	41.29523849487305
10080/28840	Theres a reason Zounds I have just killed an old	43.13359069824219
10081/28840	Indeed replied Porthos who   That poor Count de Roche	28.501827239990234
10082/28840	Well exactly like me I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to	31.150346755981445
10083/28840	Unluckily I hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with	52.65475845336914
10084/28840	And he said nothing as he died   Yes he exclaimed Oh   I suppose answered DArtagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you	31.98857307434082
10085/28840	Madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your	102.1553726196289

10092/28840	That great giant who was there gave it to	100.96002960205078

10100/28840	In fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative	63.03361511230469
10101/28840	He then returned with the same slow step and said   Go and tell the dying man that he must be	25.976665496826172

10120/28840	You seemed at dinner to be anxious about	285.4904479980469
10121/28840	I was trying said Porthos to recall where I had seen that mendicant whom I must have	42.113731384277344

10160/28840	Whats the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard   A great misfortune	48.542484283447266
10161/28840	Morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Lecle	18.1987361907959
10162/28840	And the cargo inquired the owner	128.79071044921875
10163/28840	Morrel and I think you will be satisfied on that	33.14972686767578
10164/28840	But poor Captain Leclere   What happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable	14.266803741455078
10165/28840	What happened to the worthy captain   He	55.02607727050781

10167/28840	The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the	50.41466522216797
10168/28840	And how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted	72.40281677246094

10170/28840	After a long talk with the harbormaster Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in	106.42195129394531
10171/28840	In twentyfour hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days	74.06153869628906
10172/28840	We performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirtysixpound shot at his head and his heels off El Giglio	47.49736022949219
10173/28840	We bring to his widow his sword and cross of	213.14483642578125
10174/28840	It was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the English for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody	47.78312301635742
10175/28840	Why you see Edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the	59.93935012817383
10176/28840	If not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo   Is all safe and sound	86.7279052734375
10177/28840	Morrel take my word for it and I advise you not to take 25000 francs for the profits of the	31.994218826293945
10178/28840	Then as they were just passing the Round Tower the young man shouted Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker   The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manof	35.64799880981445
10179/28840	Let goand clue up At this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly	96.63485717773438
10180/28840	Now if you will come on board	36.107337951660156
10181/28840	Morrel said Dantès observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo	19.347089767456055

10183/28840	As for me I must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in	85.14542388916016
10184/28840	The owner did not wait for a second	32.56904220581055
10185/28840	Morrel said Danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us   Yesyes poor Captain Leclere He was a brave and an honest	16.745798110961914
10186/28840	And a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel  Son replied Dangl	33.89399719238281
10187/28840	Yes said Danglars darting at Edmond a look gleaming with	25.904531478881836
10188/28840	Yes he is young and youth is invariably selfconf	47.694278717041016
10189/28840	Scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba instead of making for Marseilles	71.10317993164062
10190/28840	0025m       As to taking command of the vessel replied Morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed	35.205875396728516
10191/28840	The vessel was in as good condition as I am and as I hope you are	57.56318283081055
10192/28840	Morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing	71.39290618896484
10193/28840	Dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way   In a moment sir answered Dantès and Im with	18.4484920501709
10194/28840	Then calling to the crew he said Let go   The anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porth	193.79823303222656
10195/28840	And so in fact he is said the	83.54420471191406
10196/28840	Except your signature and your partners	116.81918334960938
10197/28840	And why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full	64.70604705810547
10198/28840	Morrel said Dantès approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and I am at your	23.086326599121094
10199/28840	You hailed me I think   Danglars retreated a step or	42.784820556640625
10200/28840	I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba   I do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere who when dying gave me a packet for Marshal Bert	22.442628860473633
10201/28840	Then did you see him Edmond   Who   The marsh	26.046022415161133
10202/28840	Morrel looked around him and then drawing Dantès on one side he said suddenly   And how is the emperor   Very well as far as I could judge from the sight of	18.271310806274414
10203/28840	You saw the emperor then   He entered the marshals apartment while I was	82.54671478271484
10204/28840	And you spoke to him   Why it was he who spoke to me sir said Dantès with a	10.861428260803223
10205/28840	And what did he say to you   Asked me questions about the vessel the time she left Marseilles the course she had taken and what was her	59.642669677734375
10206/28840	I believe if she had not been laden and I had been her master he would have bought	43.95541000366211
10207/28840	But I told him I was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel 	44.0709228515625
10208/28840	Ah yes he said I know	63.72425842285156
10209/28840	The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Val	50.4918327331543
10210/28840	_Pardieu_ and that is true cried the owner greatly	72.49822998046875
10211/28840	And that was Policar Morrel my uncle who was afterwards a	94.07740783691406
10212/28840	Dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers	59.35031509399414
10213/28840	0027m       How could that bring me into trouble sir asked Dantès for I did not even know of what I was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first com	19.163593292236328
10214/28840	But pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming	138.95223999023438
10215/28840	And the young man went to the gang	20.18848991394043
10216/28840	As he departed Danglars approached and said   Well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at PortoFerrajo   Yes most satisfactory my dear Dangl	16.97742462158203
10217/28840	Well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his	31.761497497558594
10218/28840	Dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying	38.53865051269531
10219/28840	It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this	22.675546646118164
10220/28840	Talking of Captain Leclere has not Dantès given you a letter from him   To menowas there one   I believe that besides the packet Captain Leclere confided a letter to his	35.579715728759766
10221/28840	Of what packet are you speaking Danglars   Why that which Dantès left at PortoFerra	21.50242042541504
10222/28840	How do you know he had a packet to leave at PortoFerrajo   Danglars turned very	16.457134246826172
10223/28840	I was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantè	20.921615600585938
10224/28840	He did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to	29.163387298583984
10225/28840	Morrel I beg of you said he not to say a word to Dantès on the	14.79074478149414
10226/28840	At this moment the young man returned Danglars	36.289955139160156
10227/28840	Well my dear Dantès are you now free inquired the	21.775402069091797
10228/28840	I gave the customhouse officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom I gave	72.31300354003906
10229/28840	Then you have nothing more to do here   Noeverything is all right	31.14296531677246
10230/28840	Then you can come and dine with me   I really must ask you to excuse me	27.356260299682617
10231/28840	My first visit is due to my father though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done	43.44232940673828
10232/28840	0029m       Right Dantès quite	12.053318977355957
10233/28840	I always knew you were a good	83.02603149414062
10234/28840	And inquired Dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is   Well I believe my dear Edmond though I have not seen him	15.061624526977539
10235/28840	Yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little	57.41323471069336
10236/28840	That proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your	122.52128601074219
10237/28840	My father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from	101.62787628173828
10238/28840	Well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on	56.537330627441406
10239/28840	Morrel for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to	55.31242752075195
10240/28840	True Dantès I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your fatherthe lovely Mercédè	20.406614303588867
10241/28840	Ah ha said the shipowner I am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon	24.469676971435547
10242/28840	_Peste_ Edmond you have a very handsome mistress   She is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrot	31.830406188964844
10243/28840	Sometimes one and the same thing said Morrel with a	19.362457275390625
10244/28840	Well well my dear Edmond continued the owner dont let me detain	30.962888717651367

10250/28840	Then I have your leave sir   Yes if you have nothing more to say to	21.366165161132812
10251/28840	Captain Leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me   He was unable to write	47.53986740112305
10252/28840	But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some	51.45074462890625
10253/28840	To get married   Yes first and then to go to	94.35302734375

10316/28840	As Edmond paused the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the	24.289634704589844
10317/28840	He was a man of twentyfive or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat	29.368595123291016

10324/28840	Whats the use of mentioning that What is done is	282.1068420410156
10325/28840	Let us talk of your happy return my	235.70008850097656
10326/28840	I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when I met friend Dangl	39.25773239135742
10327/28840	I was but am now back	256.2583312988281
10328/28840	And where is the dear boy our little Edmond   Why with his father no doubt replied Dangl	31.571273803710938
10329/28840	And so I came added Caderousse as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a	33.618194580078125
10330/28840	0037m       Worthy Caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to	11.96947193145752
10331/28840	I love and esteem you because honest folks are so	82.38895416259766
10332/28840	But it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the	54.1253662109375
10333/28840	The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his	60.585025787353516
10334/28840	Eh he said negligently this money is not	34.38151168823242
10335/28840	I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the	36.406002044677734
10336/28840	Come father added Dantès put this money back in your boxunless neighbor Caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his	39.36743927001953
10337/28840	I am not in any want thank God my living is suited to my	164.17478942871094
10338/28840	Keep your moneykeep it I sayone never has too muchbut at the same time my boy I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of	57.43437576293945
10339/28840	It was offered with good will said Dantè	121.49004364013672
10340/28840	Morrel I hearyou insinuating dog you  	182.97894287109375
10341/28840	Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied Dantè	17.029483795166016
10342/28840	Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with	33.96757507324219
10343/28840	What did you refuse to dine with him said old Dantès and did he invite you to dine   Yes my dear father replied Edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his	18.953371047973633
10344/28840	And why did you refuse my son inquired the old	31.388336181640625
10345/28840	That I might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young	38.99830627441406
10346/28840	I was most anxious to see	16.31865692138672
10347/28840	And when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the	87.84429931640625
10348/28840	But I explained to him the cause of my refusal replied Dantès and I hope he fully understood	23.752622604370117
10349/28840	Yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones	74.02912902832031
10350/28840	I hope to be captain without that said Dantè	27.16597557067871
10351/28840	So much the betterso much the better Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear	35.7199821472168
10352/28840	Yes my dear father and with your permission now I have seen you and know you are well and have all you require I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catal	28.060644149780273
10353/28840	No but according to all probability she soon will be replied Ed	76.34422302246094
10354/28840	Yesyes said Caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my	31.802515029907227
10355/28840	And why   Because Mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by	48.15324020385742
10356/28840	Really answered Edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneas	28.62807273864746
10357/28840	Come come said the sailor I have a better opinion than you of women in general and of Mercédès in particular and I am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to	59.63161087036133
10358/28840	So much the betterso much the better said Cader	12.858675956726074

10360/28840	I will go directly was Edmonds reply and embracing his father and nodding to Caderousse he left the	40.936275482177734
10361/28840	Caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old Dantès he went downstairs to rejoin Danglars who awaited him at the corner of the Rue Sen	14.337517738342285
10362/28840	Well said Danglars did you see him   I have just left him answered Cader	7.9221367835998535
10363/28840	Did he allude to his hope of being captain   He spoke of it as a thing already	59.440948486328125
10364/28840	Indeed said Danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to	13.668340682983398
10365/28840	So that he is quite elated about it   Why yes he is actually insolent over the matterhas already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a	42.49919891357422
10366/28840	Which you refused   Most assuredly although I might easily have accepted it for it was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now	70.01133728027344
10367/28840	Dantès has no longer any occasion for assistancehe is about to become a	18.510759353637695
10368/28840	Pooh said Danglars he is not one	32.40913391113281
10369/28840	_Ma foi_ it will be as well if he is not answered Caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to	29.071542739868164
10370/28840	If we choose replied Danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he	46.78120040893555
10371/28840	What do you mean   NothingI was speaking to	25.48740005493164
10372/28840	And is he still in love with the Catalane   Over head and ears but unless I am much mistaken there will be a storm in that	48.13031005859375

10375/28840	You do not like Dantès   I never like upst	24.20442771911621

10377/28840	I know nothing for certain only I have seen things which induce me to believe as I told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmer	32.90915298461914
10378/28840	What have you seencome tell me   Well every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed Catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls	51.96845626831055
10379/28840	Really and you think this cousin pays her attentions   I only suppose	58.49172592163086
10380/28840	What else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen   And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans   He went before I came	27.91960906982422

10411/28840	The burning Marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of	48.101043701171875
10412/28840	At first they saw nothing around	146.99862670898438
10413/28840	Their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of	69.5509262084961
10414/28840	Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of Fernand as it was defined in the	48.430870056152344
10415/28840	By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his	48.420066833496094
10416/28840	Ah your pardon said Dantès frowning in his turn I did not perceive that there were three of	18.19375228881836
10417/28840	Do you not remember him   Yes said Dantès and without relinquishing Mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial	23.36371421813965
10418/28840	But Fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and	141.5078125
10419/28840	Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing	36.475650787353516
10420/28840	This look told him all and his anger waxed	313.3584899902344
10421/28840	I did not know when I came with such haste to you that I was to meet an enemy	33.062965393066406
10422/28840	An enemy cried Mercédès with an angry look at her	16.999174118041992
10423/28840	An enemy in my house do you say Edmond If I believed that I would place my arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles leaving the house to return to it no	56.4401741027832
10424/28840	But you are deceived Edmond she	56.85075759887695
10425/28840	You have no enemy herethere is no one but Fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted	74.51485443115234
10426/28840	And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards Edmond and offered him his	26.50945281982422
10427/28840	His hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised over	36.03654098510742
10428/28840	Scarcely however had he touched Edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the	50.81197738647461
10429/28840	Oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairOh who will deliver me from this man Wretchedwretched that I am   Hallo Catalan Hallo Fernand where are you running to exclaimed a	47.93193435668945
10430/28840	The young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars under an ar	24.251296997070312
10431/28840	Well said Caderousse why dont you come Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends   Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added Dangl	25.63357925415039
10432/28840	Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a	11.938358306884766
10433/28840	He seems besotted said Danglars pushing Caderousse with his	33.02387619018555
10434/28840	You called me didnt you And he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the	84.30459594726562
10435/28840	I called you because you were running like a madman and I was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said Caderousse	25.618688583374023
10436/28840	Well Fernand I must say said Caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse	48.09614562988281
10437/28840	Bah said Danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in	60.96989440917969
10438/28840	No he replied only hark how he sighs Come come Fernand said Caderousse hold up your head and answer	59.97737503051758
10439/28840	Its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your	240.5994110107422
10440/28840	My health is well enough said Fernand clenching his hands without raising his	35.91343688964844
10441/28840	Poor Fernand has been dismissed continued Cader	74.57979583740234
10442/28840	But I thought you were a Catalan and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a	39.188350677490234
10443/28840	It was even told me that Fernand especially was terrible in his	189.84677124023438
10444/28840	A lover is never terrible he	504.57537841796875
10445/28840	Poor fellow remarked Danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his	21.77858543395996
10446/28840	Why you see he did not expect to see Dantès return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless These things always come on us more severely when they come	97.0829086303711
10447/28840	Well never mind answered Caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while Danglars had merely sipped	35.707237243652344
10448/28840	Never mindin the meantime he marries Mercédèsthe lovely Mercédèsat least he returns to do	76.55564880371094
10449/28840	During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart Caderousses words fell like molten	28.2978572845459
10450/28840	And when is the wedding to be he	114.57379150390625
10451/28840	Oh it is not yet fixed murmured	60.68497848510742
10452/28840	Well said he filling the glasses let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantès husband of the beautiful Catalane   Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a g	30.731678009033203
10453/28840	What do I see down there by the wall in the direction of the Catalans Look Fernand your eyes are better than	57.70072555541992
10454/28840	You know wine is a deceiver but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in	199.20956420898438
10455/28840	Heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing   Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand	44.44682693481445
10456/28840	Do you know them Fernand he	86.38088989257812
10457/28840	Yes was the reply in a low	18.50048828125
10458/28840	Hold your tongue will you said Danglars pretending to restrain Caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the ar	31.49701499938965
10459/28840	Try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without	164.6680908203125
10460/28840	At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died and dropped again heavily on his	129.89016723632812
10461/28840	Danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with	46.788394927978516
10462/28840	I shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a	57.969661712646484
10463/28840	Heres an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big	80.055908203125
10464/28840	Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards Sicilians and Calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one	52.51557922363281
10465/28840	Unquestionably Edmonds star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girlhe will be captain too and laugh at us all unlessa sinister smile passed over Danglars lipsunless I take a hand in the affair he	69.27941131591797
10466/28840	Ah very well thats an explanation said Cader	37.9702033996582
10467/28840	So call me Mercédès if you	14.30795955657959
10468/28840	We must excuse our worthy neighbor Caderousse said Dantès he is so easily	23.69770622253418
10469/28840	So then the wedding is to take place immediately	88.45639038085938
10470/28840	Dantès said Danglars bowing to the young	6.363609313964844
10471/28840	Danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my fathers and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at La Réser	24.39859390258789
10472/28840	My friends will be there I hope that is to say you are invited	40.50955581665039
10473/28840	And Fernand said Caderousse with a chuckle Fernand too is invited   My wifes brother is my brother said Edmond and we Mercédès and I should be very sorry if he were absent at such a	28.20529556274414
10474/28840	Fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a	15.867491722106934
10475/28840	Your pardon replied Danglars I merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the _Pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in less than three	39.0356559753418
10476/28840	We are always in a hurry to be happy	32.84978103637695
10477/28840	Danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good	23.328346252441406
10478/28840	But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste I must go to	37.4655876159668
10479/28840	Ah reallyto Paris and will it be the first time you have ever been there Dantès  	32.04386901855469
10480/28840	Have you business there   Not of my own the last commission of poor Captain Leclere you know to what I allude Danglarsit is	35.110862731933594
10481/28840	Besides I shall only take the time to go and	34.58346176147461
10482/28840	Yes yes I understand said Danglars and then in a low tone he added To Paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave	18.89414405822754
10483/28840	Ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea Ah Dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship _Pharaon_ then turning towards Edmond who was walking away A pleasant journey he	36.58664321899414
10484/28840	Thank you said Edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of	46.63776397705078
10485/28840	Well my dear sir said Danglars to Fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody	20.452972412109375
10486/28840	It drives me to despair said	404.4095458984375
10487/28840	Do you then love Mercédès   I adore her   For long   As long as I have known her	22.141502380371094
10488/28840	And you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition I did not think that was the way of your	86.80577087402344
10489/28840	What would you have me do said	123.5014877319336
10490/28840	How do I know Is it my affair I am not in love with Mademoiselle Mercédès but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall	32.07783889770508
10491/28840	What   I would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill	22.012540817260742
10492/28840	Pooh Women say those things but never do	264.0224304199219
10493/28840	You do not know Mercédès what she threatens she will	16.745899200439453
10494/28840	Thats love or I dont know what love	165.2581329345703
10495/28840	Drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all ones wit and cool	95.9624252319336
10496/28840	Idrunk said Caderousse well thats a good one I could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne fl	134.08624267578125
10497/28840	Père Pamphile more wine   And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the	21.979328155517578
10498/28840	You were saying sir said Fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted	134.56773376464844
10499/28840	This drunken Caderousse has made me lose the thread of my	91.93093872070312
10500/28840	Death alone can separate them remarked	520.7655639648438
10501/28840	You talk like a noodle my friend said Caderousse and here is Danglars who is a wideawake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are	34.70719528198242
10502/28840	Say there is no need why Dantès should die it would indeed be a pity he	35.24317169189453
10503/28840	Dantès is a good fellow I like Dantè	9.724483489990234
10504/28840	Let him run on said Danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he	33.654300689697266
10505/28840	Absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tomb	40.584136962890625
10506/28840	And why I should like to know persisted Caderousse should they put Dantès in prison he has neither robbed nor killed nor	24.754375457763672
10507/28840	I wont hold my tongue replied Caderousse I say I want to know why they should put Dantès in prison I like Dantès Dantès your health and he swallowed another glass of	28.289997100830078
10508/28840	0057m       Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards Fernand said Well you understand there is no need to kill	21.98383140563965
10509/28840	Certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having Dantès	43.481292724609375
10510/28840	Have you that means   It is to be found for the	63.605194091796875
10511/28840	But why should I meddle in the matter it is no affair of	32.301639556884766
10512/28840	I know not why you meddle said Fernand seizing his arm but this I know you have some motive of personal hatred against Dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of	42.193782806396484
10513/28840	No no said Fernand restraining him stay It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dantè	41.10093307495117
10514/28840	I hate him I confess it	112.01392364501953
10515/28840	Do you find the means I will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for Mercédès has declared she will kill herself if Dantès is	35.718204498291016
10516/28840	I wont have Dantès killedI wont   And who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied Dangl	37.32456970214844
10517/28840	We were merely joking drink to his health he added filling Caderousses glass and do not interfere with	44.960838317871094
10518/28840	Yes yes Dantès good health said Caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah   But the meansthe means said	30.97787094116211
10519/28840	Have you not hit upon any asked Dangl	70.71595764160156
10520/28840	True replied Danglars the French have the superiority over the Spaniards that the Spaniards ruminate while the French	31.9566707611084
10521/28840	Do you invent then said Fernand impatient	184.19964599609375
10522/28840	Waiter said Danglars pen ink and	49.26689147949219
10523/28840	Yes I am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools I am fit for	37.864830017089844
10524/28840	Pen ink and paper then called Fernand	114.56062316894531
10525/28840	Theres what you want on that table said the	112.95750427246094
10526/28840	The waiter did as he was	219.95462036132812
10527/28840	The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said Dangl	15.287736892700195
10528/28840	Fernand filled Caderousses glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the	67.5551986694336
10529/28840	The Catalan watched him until Caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the	51.1844367980957
10530/28840	Well resumed the Catalan as he saw the final glimmer of Caderousses reason vanishing before the last glass of	42.88082504272461
10531/28840	Yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced I will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for I know the fact	77.61112976074219
10532/28840	Yes and Mercédès Mercédès who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond   True said	21.743432998657227
10533/28840	No no continued Danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as I now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we	44.633567810058594
10534/28840	Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon	21.290679931640625
10535/28840	And Danglars wrote the address as he	34.31589889526367
10536/28840	Yes and thats all settled exclaimed Caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must	49.43643569946289
10537/28840	Yes and thats all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the	52.25632858276367
10538/28840	Dantès is my friend and I wont have him ill	25.783939361572266
10539/28840	And who thinks of using him ill Certainly neither I nor Fernand said Danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the	34.39867401123047
10540/28840	In this case replied Caderousse lets have some more	68.10289764404297
10541/28840	I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédè	14.309897422790527
10542/28840	You have had too much already drunkard said Danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your	42.44840621948242

10548/28840	Danglars took advantage of Caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte SaintVictor staggering as he	14.317255020141602
10549/28840	When they had advanced about twenty yards Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pill	31.322872161865234
10550/28840	Well said Caderousse why what a lie he told He said he was going to the Catalans and he is going to the	34.36577606201172

10553/28840	The Marriage Feast   The mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of rubytinted	50.823001861572266
10554/28840	The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Réserve with whose arbor the reader is already	49.92351531982422
10555/28840	Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the _Pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be	36.03083038330078
10556/28840	Danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by Caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with	25.861562728881836
10557/28840	Morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Réser	17.373924255371094
10558/28840	Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each	24.42643165588379
10559/28840	Having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with Edmond Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside Fernand and old Dantèsthe latter of whom attracted universal	32.27077102661133

10561/28840	His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of English manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue rib	53.122161865234375
10562/28840	Thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuiler	48.90931701660156
10563/28840	Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios Mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral	69.35133361816406

10565/28840	As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Réserve	36.484615325927734
10566/28840	Morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Lecle	37.98859405517578
10567/28840	Edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of	48.37061309814453

10569/28840	During this time Dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored	50.15224838256836
10570/28840	Morrel was seated at his right hand Danglars at his left while at a sign from Edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most	29.999372482299805

10572/28840	A pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before Mercédès	46.89847946166992
10573/28840	Now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away   Ah sighed Caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be	85.0179214477539
10574/28840	The truth is replied Dantès that I am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as	62.67354965209961
10575/28840	Danglars looked towards Fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh	63.482452392578125
10576/28840	Why what ails you asked he of Ed	43.24601364135742
10577/28840	Do you fear any approaching evil I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this	96.57685852050781
10578/28840	And that is the very thing that alarms me returned Dantè	18.021347045898438
10579/28840	I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of Mercédè	42.02076721191406
10580/28840	Nay nay cried Caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor	70.9531021118164
10581/28840	Well never mind that neighbor Caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as	28.44207000732422
10582/28840	Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will	22.947786331176758
10583/28840	A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder Dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white	35.63582992553711
10584/28840	Mercédès looked pleased and gratified while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive	20.585205078125
10585/28840	In an hour inquired Danglars turning	13.226009368896484
10586/28840	How is that my friend   Why thus it is replied Dantè	20.094749450683594

10588/28840	We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at halfpast two oclock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city	40.452110290527344
10589/28840	Now as a quarterpast one has already struck I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantè	55.19423294067383
10590/28840	Upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of	54.69111633300781
10591/28840	Mercédès has no fortune I have none to settle on	23.361345291137695
10592/28840	So you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very	184.98362731933594
10593/28840	This joke elicited a fresh burst of	95.27168273925781
10594/28840	So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said Dangl	46.9144287109375
10595/28840	No no answered Dantès dont imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby	31.63388442993164
10596/28840	Tomorrow morning I start for Paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time I shall be	75.86548614501953
10597/28840	I shall be back here by the first of March and on the second I give my real marriage	76.87818908691406
10598/28840	Dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Ed	21.167255401611328
10599/28840	Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of	74.58750915527344
10600/28840	Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable	56.404605865478516
10601/28840	Everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own	86.76062774658203
10602/28840	Fernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Dangl	54.83058166503906
10603/28840	Caderousse approached him just as Danglars whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the	34.62519073486328
10604/28840	I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning	35.64120101928711
10605/28840	Caderousse looked full at Fernandhe was ghastly	57.40354537963867
10606/28840	Certainly continued Danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is	38.28828811645508

10609/28840	0071m       To be sureto be sure cried Dantès eagerly quitting the table let us go directly   His words were reechoed by the whole party with vociferous	17.574602127075195
10610/28840	At this moment Danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open	35.68608474731445
10611/28840	Three blows were struck upon the panel of the	114.10594177246094
10612/28840	The company looked at each other in constern	25.884441375732422
10613/28840	I demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law As no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corpor	51.831886291503906
10614/28840	Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those	80.2022476196289
10615/28840	May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said	56.51210403442383
10616/28840	Morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily	92.36796569824219

10618/28840	Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was	106.58043670654297
10619/28840	He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effig	55.52904510498047
10620/28840	There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to	69.3130111694336
10621/28840	He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said My worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehens	100.34870147705078
10622/28840	Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his	57.05784225463867
10623/28840	What is the meaning of all this inquired Caderousse frowningly of Danglars who had assumed an air of utter	19.324750900268555
10624/28840	0073m       How can I tell you replied he I am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is	19.41973876953125
10625/28840	Caderousse then looked around for Fernand but he had	46.7644157409668
10626/28840	The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clear	75.23712921142578
10627/28840	The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his	75.41777038574219
10628/28840	Nonsense returned Danglars I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that I tore the paper to	32.455711364746094
10629/28840	No you did not answered Caderousse you merely threw it byI saw it lying in a	65.90154266357422
10630/28840	Hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk   Where is Fernand inquired Cader	39.80401611328125
10631/28840	How do I know replied Danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most	55.072566986083984

10634/28840	Dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the	15.702956199645996
10635/28840	A carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards Marse	38.14728927612305
10636/28840	Adieu adieu dearest Edmond cried Mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the	26.47020721435547
10637/28840	The prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out Goodbye Mercédèswe shall soon meet again Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint	70.15252685546875
10638/28840	Wait for me here all of you cried	225.55764770507812
10639/28840	Morrel I will take the first conveyance I find and hurry to Marseilles whence I will bring you word how all is going	67.47380828857422
10640/28840	Thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can   This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left	59.278900146484375
10641/28840	The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others	31.33292579650879
10642/28840	He is the cause of all this miseryI am quite sure of it whispered Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off Fernand to Dangl	24.974960327148438
10643/28840	I dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a	72.1338882446289
10644/28840	I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought	69.27647399902344
10645/28840	You dont mention those who aided and abetted the deed said Cader	141.10211181640625
10646/28840	Surely answered Danglars one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the	41.85411834716797
10647/28840	You can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys	152.56610107421875
10648/28840	Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different	101.66534423828125
10649/28840	What think you Danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event   Why replied he I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contr	40.30002975463867
10650/28840	But how could he have done so without your knowledge Danglars since you are the ships supercargo   Why as for that I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was lad	34.49452209472656
10651/28840	I know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastrets warehouse and at Smyrna from Pascals that is all I was obliged to know and I beg I may not be asked for any further	44.05368423461914
10652/28840	Now I recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me   There you see exclaimed Dangl	52.78862380981445
10653/28840	Now the mischief is out depend upon it the customhouse people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor Dantès hidden	166.17529296875
10654/28840	Mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers	29.152694702148438
10655/28840	Her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sob	110.3329086303711
10656/28840	Come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope   Hope repeated Dangl	38.220802307128906
10657/28840	Hope faintly murmured Fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his count	43.88951873779297
10658/28840	Good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the	119.44044494628906
10659/28840	No doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released   Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the	25.960752487182617
10660/28840	What news exclaimed a general burst of	343.7248229980469
10661/28840	Morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I	36.418800354003906
10662/28840	Oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth Mercédè	43.46019744873047
10663/28840	Morrel but still he is charged   With what inquired the elder Dantè	23.43817901611328
10664/28840	With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is	46.98090362548828
10665/28840	A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès the old man sank into a	23.086959838867188
10666/28840	Ah Danglars whispered Caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but I cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your	59.873966217041016
10667/28840	I am determined to tell them all about	16.30489730834961
10668/28840	Be silent you simpleton cried Danglars grasping him by the arm or I will not answer even for your own	43.37697982788086
10669/28840	Who can tell whether Dantès be innocent or guilty The vessel did touch at Elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the	45.73845672607422
10670/28840	Suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his	144.93121337890625
10671/28840	If he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a	63.334327697753906
10672/28840	With all my heart replied Danglars pleased to find the other so tract	48.50202560424805
10673/28840	Let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their	60.34025573730469
10674/28840	After their departure Fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of Dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the Allées de Meil	29.489025115966797
10675/28840	The rumor of Edmonds arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the	36.58480453491211
10676/28840	Could you ever have credited such a thing my dear Danglars asked	47.34212112426758
10677/28840	Morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès from	40.25065612792969
10678/28840	de Villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and Cader	28.91221809387207
10679/28840	Could you have believed such a thing possible   Why you know I told you replied Danglars that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious	23.59593963623047
10680/28840	And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself   0079m       Certainly not returned Dangl	16.771345138549805
10681/28840	Then added in a low whisper You understand that on account of your uncle	68.7645034790039
10682/28840	Policar Morrel who served under the _other_ government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of	96.82230377197266
10683/28840	I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself had I divulged my own apprehensions to a	61.4321174621582
10684/28840	I am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all	73.76136779785156
10685/28840	You are a worthy fellow and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon	22.753015518188477
10686/28840	Is it possible you were so kind   Yes indeed I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between	36.310874938964844
10687/28840	And what was his reply   That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference	88.71033477783203
10688/28840	No one can deny his being a noblehearted young	145.64547729492188

10690/28840	Oh replied Danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at	22.660175323486328
10691/28840	No doubt but in the meantime   I am entirely at your service	31.175094604492188
10692/28840	Thanks Danglarsthat will smooth over all	109.98412322998047
10693/28840	I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_ and look carefully to the unloading of her	20.76622772216797
10694/28840	Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with	31.99437713623047

10702/28840	Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence   Not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such	42.50381088256836
10703/28840	But who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but Fernand you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the roomindeed I fancied I had destroyed	44.812255859375

10706/28840	Well then if you did depend upon it Fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying	53.193302154541016
10707/28840	And now I think of it by Heavens he may have sent the letter itself Fortunately for me the handwriting was	88.74303436279297

10710/28840	It seems however that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the	126.32676696777344

10825/28840	You know we cannot yet pronounce him	521.3949584960938
10826/28840	He is in safe custody answered Villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the heads	37.72283935546875

10942/28840	And that was too much far too much murmured Ville	37.314327239990234
10943/28840	Villeforts brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dantès with	27.470684051513672
10944/28840	After reading the letter Villefort covered his face with his	27.38140296936035
10945/28840	Oh said Dantès timidly what is the matter Villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the	21.093965530395508

10951/28840	Oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort I am lost And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his	21.210691452026367
10952/28840	Oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he	54.2515754699707

10966/28840	Villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his	37.48077392578125
10967/28840	Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself halffainting into a	23.82965660095215

10975/28840	A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest	41.49840545654297
10976/28840	The Palais de Justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clocktower of the Accou	36.919525146484375
10977/28840	After numberless windings Dantès saw a door with an iron w	63.62548828125
10978/28840	The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his	38.56231689453125
10979/28840	The door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind	31.70631980895996

10981/28840	He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of Villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of	57.943519592285156
10982/28840	It was four oclock when Dantès was placed in this	15.7631196975708
10983/28840	It was as we have said the 1st of March and the prisoner was soon buried in	35.17903518676758
10984/28840	The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and Dantès sank again into his	24.386245727539062
10985/28840	By the torchlight Dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarm	21.516258239746094
10986/28840	He had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of	60.96738815307617

10998/28840	Can all this force be summoned on my account thought	149.92550659179688
10999/28840	The officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered Dantès question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the	44.49259948730469

11016/28840	How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her   One light alone was visible and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès	22.411930084228516

11060/28840	With the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave Dantès where he	29.728126525878906
11061/28840	He found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with	87.90283203125
11062/28840	He had passed the night standing and without	86.35816192626953
11063/28840	The jailer advanced Dantès appeared not to perceive	38.18569564819336

11065/28840	Do you wish for anything   I wish to see the	18.195972442626953
11066/28840	The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the	19.427207946777344
11067/28840	Dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door	12.693683624267578
11068/28840	All his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus	53.567176818847656
11069/28840	The day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its	79.76600646972656
11070/28840	He had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome	102.24649810791016
11071/28840	The thought was maddening and Dantès threw himself furiously down on his	26.896116256713867
11072/28840	The next morning at the same hour the jailer came	26.60993194580078
11073/28840	Well said the jailer are you more reasonable today Dantès made no	21.335094451904297

11075/28840	I have already told you it was	8.942161560058594
11076/28840	Why so   Because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for	79.46530151367188
11077/28840	What is allowed then   Better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk	87.3196792602539

11081/28840	The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued	70.68187713623047
11082/28840	What you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his	35.02238082885742

11086/28840	You think so   Yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before	71.75508117675781

11091/28840	Well said Dantès mark this if you refuse at least to tell Mercédès I am here I will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter I will dash out your brains with this	28.143495559692383
11092/28840	Threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going	122.5077896118164
11093/28840	The abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons	69.78146362304688
11094/28840	Dantès whirled the stool round his	18.615827560424805
11095/28840	All right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it	81.78675079345703

11102/28840	The soldiers seized Dantès who followed	51.365882873535156
11103/28840	He descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust	40.89765548706055
11104/28840	The door closed and Dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the	27.619802474975586

11123/28840	Then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay perhaps even now I shall arrive too	68.65444946289062
11124/28840	The deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then   And sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market	29.96161460876465
11125/28840	Now then said Villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook I must have another   To whom   To the	19.794309616088867

11130/28840	Doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with	75.13886260986328
11131/28840	The keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to	63.29634475708008

11142/28840	Villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary	35.823890686035156
11143/28840	At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for	46.583499908447266

11301/28840	And how many men had he with him   I do not know sire answered the minister of	22.75368881225586
11302/28840	What you do not know Have you neglected to obtain information on that point Of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering	30.1826171875
11303/28840	Sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usur	52.797508239746094
11304/28840	And how did this despatch reach you inquired the	70.3165283203125
11305/28840	The minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out   By the telegraph s	33.7706413269043
11306/28840	advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have	133.1681365966797
11307/28840	0141m       So then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that	25.310800552368164
11308/28840	A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after fiveandtwenty years of	61.867427825927734
11309/28840	What our enemies say of us is then	309.3564758300781
11310/28840	de Blacas wiped the moisture from his	65.73065948486328
11311/28840	Villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased	117.19779968261719
11312/28840	To fall continued King Louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspendedto fall and learn of that fall by telegraph Oh I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother Louis	127.76566314697266
11313/28840	than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by	68.48262786865234
11314/28840	Ridicule sirwhy you know not its power in France and yet you ought to know it   Sire sire murmured the minister for pitys   Approach	40.392330169677734
11315/28840	de Villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a	38.74490737915039
11316/28840	Approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not	37.41857147216797
11317/28840	Sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the	74.94033813476562
11318/28840	Really impossible Yesthat is a great word	92.2962417602539
11319/28840	Unfortunately there are great words as there are great men I have measured	85.14214324951172
11320/28840	The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort who bent his head in modest	70.17755889892578
11321/28840	I do not mean that for you Blacas continued Louis XV	24.33540916442871
11322/28840	for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your	45.42255401611328
11323/28840	Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of	84.03656768798828
11324/28840	de Villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal	82.20584869384766
11325/28840	These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour	52.74099349975586
11326/28840	Any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably	41.70846176147461
11327/28840	In fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth Napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villeforts	55.13691711425781
11328/28840	Realizing this Villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead of aiding to crush	54.866024017333984
11329/28840	Do not attribute to me more than I deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of	47.5447998046875
11330/28840	And now gentlemen he continued turning towards	132.4790496826172
11331/28840	de Blacas and the minister of police I have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of	35.67241668701172
11332/28840	de Blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and	97.93409729003906
11333/28840	Do not mention reports duke to me for I know now what confidence to place in	218.31138610839844
11334/28840	Yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue SaintJacques   The affair in the Rue SaintJacques exclaimed Villefort unable to repress an ex	21.46547508239746
11335/28840	Then suddenly pausing he added Your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect I have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of	37.734657287597656
11336/28840	Go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries	76.93367004394531
11337/28840	On the contrary siron the contrary said Louis XV	55.36433029174805
11338/28840	this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of General Quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal	32.45185852050781
11339/28840	At the name of General Quesnel Villefort tremb	15.986594200134277
11340/28840	Everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of	66.46869659423828
11341/28840	General Quesnel it appears had just left a Bonapartist club when he	46.75877380371094
11342/28840	An unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the Rue SaintJacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the	47.6029052734375
11343/28840	As the police minister related this to the king Villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and	67.09708404541016
11344/28840	Do you not think with me	137.6542510986328
11345/28840	de Villefort that General Quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush   It is probable sire replied Ville	16.178176879882812
11346/28840	But is this all that is known   They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with	38.61744689941406
11347/28840	Yes the servant has given his	234.2261199951172
11348/28840	He is a man of from fifty to fiftytwo years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moust	29.783981323242188
11349/28840	He was dressed in a blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his buttonhole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of	9.092528343200684
11350/28840	Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue CoqHé	19.85139274597168
11351/28840	Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed	43.34323501586914
11352/28840	It required all Villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired	46.994873046875
11353/28840	How strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say A murder has been committed and especially so when they can add And we are on the track of the guilty	103.0423355102539
11354/28840	Sire your majesty will I trust be amply satisfied on this point at	98.73162841796875
11355/28840	I will no longer detain you	22.068553924560547
11356/28840	de Villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and	40.39680480957031
11357/28840	Of course you stopped at your fathers A feeling of faintness came over Ville	168.2173614501953
11358/28840	0145m       No sire he replied I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid in the Rue de Tourn	14.961530685424805
11359/28840	But you have seen him   Sire I went straight to the Duc de Bl	15.570878028869629
11360/28840	But you will see him then   I think not s	18.20805549621582
11361/28840	Ah I forgot said Louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive I forgot you and	76.86840057373047
11362/28840	Noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recomp	70.74506378173828
11363/28840	Sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask	50.43476867675781
11364/28840	Never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind	65.17195129394531
11365/28840	In the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of	46.349952697753906
11366/28840	Louis above the order of NotreDameduMontCarmel and	66.28597259521484
11367/28840	Lazare and gave it to Villefortin the meanwhile take this	66.74810028076172
11368/28840	Sire said Villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers	63.79488754272461
11369/28840	take it such as it is for I have not the time to procure you	35.37981033325195
11370/28840	Blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to	104.09979248046875
11371/28840	Villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed	24.937650680541992
11372/28840	Sire replied Villefort bowing in an hour I shall have quitted	18.75834846496582
11373/28840	Go sir said the king and should I forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my	70.37754821777344
11374/28840	Baron send for the minister of	321.78857421875
11375/28840	Ah sir said the minister of police to Villefort as they left the Tuileries you entered by lucks dooryour fortune is	37.982582092285156
11376/28840	Will it be long first muttered Villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackneyco	52.76628875732422
11377/28840	One passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of	84.9466781616211
11378/28840	Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to	36.47441482543945
11379/28840	He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and	52.44972229003906
11380/28840	The valet opened the door and Villefort heard someone speak his	23.85260772705078
11381/28840	0147m       Who could know that I was here already said the young	14.255280494689941
11382/28840	Well said Villefort what is itWho rangWho asked for me   A stranger who will not send in his	24.433597564697266
11383/28840	A stranger who will not send in his name What can he want with me   He wishes to speak to	28.14363670349121
11384/28840	Did he mention my name  	115.75163269042969
11385/28840	What sort of person is he   Why sir a man of about	40.75494384765625
11386/28840	Short or tall   About your own height	90.51309204101562

11389/28840	It is he said Villefort turning	22.50635528564453
11390/28840	Well then if you felt so sure replied the newcomer putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair allow me to say my dear Gérard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the	24.285568237304688
11391/28840	The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of aston	40.878177642822266
11392/28840	Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to Villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not	32.6182861328125
11393/28840	Noirtier seating himself I might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of February and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in	39.541603088378906
11394/28840	And if I have come my dear father said Gérard drawing closer to	42.020729064941406
11395/28840	Noirtier do not complain for it is for you that I came and my journey will be your	60.0440788269043
11396/28840	Noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the	66.61166381835938
11397/28840	Really pray tell me all about it for it must be	34.73394012451172
11398/28840	Father you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue SaintJacques  	10.1438570022583
11399/28840	Why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from Paris in a haycart been hunted over the plains of Bordeaux by Robespierres bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most	40.13980484008789
11400/28840	0151m       And who told you this fine story   The king	11.74395751953125
11401/28840	Well then in return for your story continued Noirtier I will tell you	30.43255615234375
11402/28840	My dear father I think I already know what you are about to tell	23.43572998046875
11403/28840	Ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor   Not so loud father I entreat of youfor your own sake as well as	42.49959182739258
11404/28840	Yes I heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible speed halfdesperate at the enforced	67.875732421875
11405/28840	Why three days ago the emperor had not	86.79058074951172
11406/28840	No matter I was aware of his	83.09735870361328
11407/28840	How did you know about it   By a letter addressed to you from the Island of El	11.771718978881836
11408/28840	To me   To you and which I discovered in the pocketbook of the	32.44856262207031
11409/28840	Had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been	89.94448852539062
11410/28840	Come come said he will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly Shot my dear boy What an idea Where is the letter you speak of I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass	65.52153015136719
11411/28840	I burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your	153.1189727783203
11412/28840	And the destruction of your future prospects replied Noirtier yes I can easily comprehend	30.49202537536621
11413/28840	But I have nothing to fear while I have you to protect	30.96775245666504
11414/28840	I do better than that sirI save	66.99960327148438
11415/28840	You do Why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain	49.7093505859375
11416/28840	I must refer again to the club in the Rue SaintJac	15.339458465576172
11417/28840	It appears that this club is rather a bore to the	202.75674438476562
11418/28840	Why didnt they search more vigilantly they would have found   They have not found but they are on the	57.2943000793457
11419/28840	Yes that the usual phrase I am quite familiar with	40.379913330078125
11420/28840	When the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is	62.82090377807617
11421/28840	Yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a	94.27423095703125
11422/28840	A murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was	98.76194763183594
11423/28840	People are found every day in the Seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to	115.57695007324219
11424/28840	Father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of	33.38552474975586
11425/28840	No no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the	165.99893188476562
11426/28840	And who thus designated it   The king	63.24321746826172
11427/28840	The king I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in	45.76333236694336
11428/28840	In politics my dear fellow you know as well as I do there are no men but ideasno feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is	71.00411224365234
11429/28840	Would you like to know how matters have progressed Well I will tell	90.1447982788086
11430/28840	It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba one of us went to him and invited him to the Rue SaintJacques where he would find some	21.171545028686523
11431/28840	He came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba the projected landing	82.60858154296875
11432/28840	When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royal	32.19485092163086
11433/28840	Then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeperfectly	50.63895034790039
11434/28840	What could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way thats	165.75880432128906
11435/28840	A murder really Villefort you surprise	247.6934356689453
11436/28840	But father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be	130.3415985107422
11437/28840	You rely on the usurpers return   We	75.3331298828125
11438/28840	You are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of France without being followed tracked and caught like a wild	62.68687438964844
11439/28840	My dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons and on the 20th or 25th at	32.48031234741211
11440/28840	He has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against	44.851566314697266
11441/28840	Yes to escort him into the	144.63682556152344
11442/28840	Really my dear Gérard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing The usurper has landed at Cannes with several	44.76345443725586
11443/28840	But where is he what is he doing You do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to Paris without drawing a	44.81703186035156
11444/28840	Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable	177.40501403808594
11445/28840	Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall Lyons will hasten to welcome	216.60287475585938
11446/28840	Believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your	60.98277282714844
11447/28840	Would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet I knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the	55.409732818603516
11448/28840	You gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet I have your address and in proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at	78.42476654052734
11449/28840	Ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine	34.91563415527344
11450/28840	Indeed replied Villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well	31.147293090820312

11456/28840	What is that   The description of the man who on the morning of the day when General Quesnel disappeared presented himself at his	18.374858856201172
11457/28840	Ah ha thats it is it said Noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him   Because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the Rue CoqHé	23.60137939453125
11458/28840	Didnt I say that your police were good for nothing   Yes but they may catch him	92.12981414794922
11459/28840	True said Noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile He will consequently make a few changes in his personal	43.10446548461914
11460/28840	At these words he rose and put off his frockcoat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his sons toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whisk	39.612545013427734
11461/28840	Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of	58.116798400878906
11462/28840	Well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me	101.26719665527344
11463/28840	No father stammered Villefort at least I hope	25.36997413635254
11464/28840	And now my dear boy continued Noirtier I rely on your prudence to remove all the things which I leave in your	34.46403121948242
11465/28840	Yes yes and now I believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured I will return the favor	30.49513816833496

11477/28840	Villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the Rue B	46.6867790222168
11478/28840	Noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had	45.89173126220703
11479/28840	Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the	56.11147689819336
11480/28840	made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the	51.77620315551758
11481/28840	Villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the Legion of Honor which he had the prudence not to wear although	47.933406829833984

11483/28840	Napoleon would doubtless have deprived Villefort of his office had it not been for Noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the Girondin of 93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his	39.61299514770508

11490/28840	The deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of Marseilles when one morning his door opened and	55.75651168823242
11491/28840	Anyone else would have hastened to receive him but Villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of	33.033607482910156
11492/28840	He made Morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered	46.613582611083984

11511/28840	I recollect now it was a very serious	67.92244720458984
11512/28840	How so   You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de	22.486637115478516
11513/28840	Well   I made my report to the authorities at Paris and a week after he was carried	45.11825180053711
11514/28840	What can they have done with him   Oh he has been taken to Fenestrelles to Pignerol or to the SainteMarguérite	42.01610565185547
11515/28840	Some fine morning he will return to take command of your	147.1755828857422
11516/28840	Come when he will it shall be kept for	87.76801300048828
11517/28840	But how is it he is not already returned It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to	50.104095458984375
11518/28840	The order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been	85.76414489746094

11523/28840	Had Morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled	102.99453735351562
11524/28840	de Villefort how would you advise me to act asked	21.647581100463867
11525/28840	Oh I know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read	72.42532348632812
11526/28840	That is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by	66.5188217163086
11527/28840	And will you undertake to deliver it   With the greatest	33.10269546508789
11528/28840	Dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn	39.26435089111328
11529/28840	Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defence	66.94703674316406
11530/28840	But how shall I address the minister   Sit down there said Villefort giving up his place to Morrel and write what I	35.967376708984375
11531/28840	Will you be so good  	86.83392333984375
11532/28840	But lose no time we have lost too much	105.70257568359375
11533/28840	Only think what the poor fellow may even now be	179.8599090576172
11534/28840	Villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw	20.9863224029541
11535/28840	Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villeforts	22.92534828186035
11536/28840	Villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt Dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of Napoleons	34.812435150146484
11537/28840	It was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release	42.885162353515625
11538/28840	The petition finished Villefort read it	251.6544952392578
11539/28840	That will do said he leave the rest to	220.92564392089844
11540/28840	Will the petition go soon  	539.1070556640625
11541/28840	Countersigned by you   The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your	100.12239074707031
11542/28840	And sitting down Villefort wrote the certificate at the	44.4438591003418
11543/28840	What more is to be done   I will do whatever is	46.38467788696289
11544/28840	This assurance delighted Morrel who took leave of Villefort and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he would soon see his	21.92788314819336
11545/28840	As for Villefort instead of sending to Paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second	40.133575439453125
11546/28840	Dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XV	28.0607967376709
11547/28840	s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the	147.89695739746094
11548/28840	Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand and twice had Villefort soothed him with	122.57283020019531
11549/28840	At last there was Waterloo and Morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself useless	79.66364288330078
11550/28840	And so Dantès after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and	61.13209915161133
11551/28840	Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantès and when Napoleon returned to France he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence _a decree of Providence	30.822534561157227
11552/28840	But when Napoleon returned to Paris Danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of Dantès return on a mission of	39.86513137817383

11554/28840	He then left for Madrid and was no more heard	135.93341064453125
11555/28840	Fernand understood nothing except that Dantès was	28.979890823364258
11556/28840	What had become of him he cared not to	62.86827850341797
11557/28840	Fernands mind was made up he would shoot Dantès and then kill	127.69720458984375
11558/28840	But Fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly	128.04420471191406
11559/28840	During this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the	98.94940948486328
11560/28840	Fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercédè	75.0386734008789
11561/28840	Had Fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from Mercédè	27.451631546020508
11562/28840	His devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsMercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand and this was now strengthened by	57.227046966552734
11563/28840	My brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed I shall be alone in the	56.21731948852539
11564/28840	These words carried a ray of hope into Fernands	237.54905700683594

11568/28840	Sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards Marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her	52.93868637084961
11569/28840	It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved	133.35992431640625
11570/28840	Caderousse was like Fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the	67.78730010986328
11571/28840	Old Dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at Napoleons	45.69792938232422

11574/28840	There was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his deathbed the father of so dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès was stigmatized as a	50.45120620727539

11579/28840	He inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to	59.835575103759766
11580/28840	The universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set	47.15934371948242

11603/28840	You are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the	47.61018371582031
11604/28840	Now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of a party in Italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is	50.011962890625
11605/28840	He used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows	273.08697509765625
11606/28840	You had better see him for his madness is	168.48605346679688
11607/28840	I will see them both returned the inspector I must conscientiously perform my	47.6607780456543
11608/28840	This was the inspectors first visit he wished to display his	100.39205932617188
11609/28840	Let us visit this one first added	295.9221496582031
11610/28840	By all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the	37.277122497558594
11611/28840	At the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges Dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his	23.716941833496094
11612/28840	Seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded Dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped	55.123748779296875
11613/28840	The soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three	32.81239318847656
11614/28840	Dantès saw that he was looked upon as	23.670642852783203
11615/28840	Then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with	103.56359100341797
11616/28840	The inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed He will become religioushe is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonetsmadmen are not afraid of anything I made some curious observations on this at Charent	89.17013549804688
11617/28840	Then turning to the prisoner What is it you want said	44.4536018371582
11618/28840	I want to know what crime I have committedto be tried and if I am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at	44.48314666748047
11619/28840	Are you well fed said the	29.010330200195312
11620/28840	I believe so I dont know its of no	86.64337921142578
11621/28840	What matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his execution	75.70276641845703
11622/28840	You are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turn	61.860374450683594
11623/28840	It is true sir and I beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but I was	34.13547897338867
11624/28840	And you are not so any longer   No captivity has subdued meI have been here so	41.58895492553711
11625/28840	So longwhen were you arrested then asked the	126.11221313476562

11628/28840	You must show me the proofs against	131.4807586669922
11629/28840	Certainly but you will find terrible	82.3882064819336
11630/28840	Monsieur continued Dantès I know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meyou can have me triedand that is all I	23.309782028198242
11631/28840	Let me know my crime and the reason why I was	106.88504791259766
11632/28840	Go on with the lights said the	148.77487182617188
11633/28840	Monsieur cried Dantès I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to	52.763343811035156
11634/28840	I cannot tell you that replied the inspector I can only promise to examine into your	44.97299575805664
11635/28840	Oh I am freethen I am saved   Who arrested you  	43.99409866333008
11636/28840	See him and hear what he	46.761741638183594
11637/28840	Villefort is no longer at Marseilles he is now at Toul	20.14255142211914
11638/28840	I am no longer surprised at my detention murmured Dantès since my only protector is	25.55472755432129
11639/28840	de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you   None on the contrary he was very kind to	21.20886993408203
11640/28840	I can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you   Entire	41.38633346557617
11641/28840	Dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnest	11.682987213134766
11642/28840	The door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès	27.877134323120117
11643/28840	0173m       Will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell   Let us visit them all said the	19.7236328125
11644/28840	If I once went up those	433.1148681640625
11645/28840	I should never have the courage to come down	39.13222885131836
11646/28840	Ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of	75.645751953125
11647/28840	What is his folly   He fancies he possesses an immense	38.14126968383789
11648/28840	The first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on	90.911865234375
11649/28840	He is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five	87.21647644042969
11650/28840	How curiouswhat is his name   The Abbé Far	17.498926162719727
11651/28840	It is here unlock the door Ant	67.1284408569336
11652/28840	The turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the _mad abbé_ as the prisoner was usually	36.46285629272461
11653/28840	In the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered	33.11250686645508
11654/28840	He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew	63.17808151245117
11655/28840	He did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons	35.683414459228516
11656/28840	He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round	56.791690826416016
11657/28840	What is it you want said the	28.51795196533203
11658/28840	I monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surpriseI want	11.3792724609375
11659/28840	You do not understand continued the inspector I am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the	63.49689483642578
11660/28840	Oh that is different cried the abbé and we shall understand each other I	24.81742286682129
11661/28840	There now whispered the governor it is just as I told	34.557769775390625
11662/28840	Monsieur continued the prisoner I am the Abbé Faria born at	18.307485580444336
11663/28840	I was for twenty years Cardinal Spadas secretary I was arrested why I know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French	46.44257354736328
11664/28840	Why from the French government   Because I was arrested at Piombino and I presume that like Milan and Florence Piombino has become the capital of some French	28.665691375732422
11665/28840	Monsieur returned the inspector Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warm	60.554786682128906
11666/28840	It is the only means of rendering Italy strong happy and	78.30328369140625
11667/28840	Very possibly only I am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain	47.92628860473633
11668/28840	We are coming to the point whispered the	59.432498931884766
11669/28840	It is for that reason I am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change Newtons	30.628948211669922
11670/28840	Could you allow me a few words in	79.54859161376953
11671/28840	What did I tell you said the	31.757144927978516
11672/28840	You knew him returned the inspector with a	49.223052978515625
11673/28840	What you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing Far	27.025331497192383
11674/28840	0175m       But said the abbé I would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five	12.631616592407227
11675/28840	The very sum you named whispered the inspector in his	119.68890380859375
11676/28840	However continued Faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be	33.29648208618164
11677/28840	Unfortunately said the governor I know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his	36.99886703491211
11678/28840	Of course said he of what else should I speak  	167.08587646484375
11679/28840	Inspector continued the governor I can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five	42.77878189086914
11680/28840	That proves returned the abbé that you are like those of Holy Writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear	130.19219970703125
11681/28840	My dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are	96.41637420654297
11682/28840	The abbés eyes glistened he seized the inspectors	21.966331481933594
11683/28840	But what if I am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this treasure will be	98.94417572021484
11684/28840	Had not government better profit by it I will offer six millions and I will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my	49.49640655517578
11685/28840	On my word said the inspector in a low tone had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad I should believe what he	28.148542404174805
11686/28840	I am not mad replied Faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to	79.71977233886719
11687/28840	The treasure I speak of really exists and I offer to sign an agreement with you in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if I deceive you bring me here againI ask no	52.37213897705078
11688/28840	Is the spot far from here   A hundred	69.38533782958984
11689/28840	It is not illplanned said the	38.08485794067383
11690/28840	If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of	60.96983337402344
11691/28840	The scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbés plan has not even the merit of original	36.69099807739258
11692/28840	Then turning to Faria I inquired if you are well fed said	53.50916290283203
11693/28840	Swear to me replied Faria to free me if what I tell you prove true and I will stay here while you go to the	56.38430404663086
11694/28840	Are you well fed repeated the	77.26948547363281
11695/28840	Monsieur you run no risk for as I told you I will stay here so there is no chance of my	37.97838592529297
11696/28840	You do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatient	64.05953979492188
11697/28840	Nor you to mine cried the abb	36.49049758911133
11698/28840	You will not accept my gold I will keep it for	56.415767669677734
11699/28840	You refuse me my liberty God will give it	227.05587768554688
11700/28840	And the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his	47.46805191040039
11701/28840	0177m       What is he doing there said the	9.49421215057373
11702/28840	Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound	38.285884857177734
11703/28840	The turnkey closed the door behind	38.17289733886719
11704/28840	He was wealthy once perhaps said the	269.6031494140625
11705/28840	Or dreamed he was and awoke	937.6100463867188
11706/28840	After all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been	26.271665573120117
11707/28840	So the matter ended for the Abbé Far	16.38360023498535
11708/28840	He remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his	107.86886596679688
11709/28840	Caligula or Nero those treasureseekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed	65.96995544433594
11710/28840	But the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor	122.04600524902344
11711/28840	They fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their	250.9936981201172
11712/28840	Formerly they believed themselves sprung from Jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviol	48.84227752685547
11713/28840	It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reapp	55.546260833740234
11714/28840	The very madness of the Abbé Faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual	48.13322448730469
11715/28840	The inspector kept his word with Dantès he examined the register and found the following note concerning him   _Edmond Dantès_   Violent Bonapartist took an active part in the return from El	19.29759979248047
11716/28840	The greatest watchfulness and care to be	238.40147399902344
11717/28840	This note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his	85.09351348876953
11718/28840	The inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote _Nothing to be	150.28445434570312
11719/28840	Days and weeks passed away then monthsDantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in a	76.3238754272461
11720/28840	This fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six	90.48267364501953

11722/28840	At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at	80.27973175048828
11723/28840	He took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them Dantès jail	55.20545196533203
11724/28840	A new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers	139.68157958984375
11725/28840	This horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantèshe was now number	46.847740173339844
11726/28840	Number 34 and Number 27   Dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in	74.66736602783203

11728/28840	Dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some	61.140377044677734
11729/28840	He entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing	130.09515380859375
11730/28840	His requests were not granted but he went on asking all the	148.95816040039062
11731/28840	He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was	103.1236801147461
11732/28840	Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified	29.18622398376465
11733/28840	Often before his captivity Dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and	47.899078369140625
11734/28840	He now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the	70.7228775024414
11735/28840	The galleyslaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each	22.208608627319336
11736/28840	He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abb	93.29265594482422
11737/28840	The jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a	65.88778686523438
11738/28840	Dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to	39.66953659057617
11739/28840	He laid every action of his life before the Almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against	64.46294403076172
11740/28840	Yet in spite of his earnest prayers Dantès remained a	39.56537628173828
11741/28840	He could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so	162.45339965820312

11743/28840	Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene mene tekel upharsin_ of Belshazz	36.70577621459961
11744/28840	He told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of Heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest	58.559932708740234
11745/28840	He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconscious	105.57634735107422
11746/28840	By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on	141.54959106445312

11756/28840	No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a wornout	89.85772705078125
11757/28840	Two methods of selfdestruction were at his	88.4668960571289
11758/28840	He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of	99.61051940917969
11759/28840	But the first was repugnant to	47.08134078979492
11760/28840	Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yardarm he would not die by what seemed an infamous	67.47188568115234
11761/28840	He resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his	126.91806030273438

11773/28840	It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death   Suddenly about nine oclock in the evening Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was	31.267963409423828
11774/28840	So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual Edmond raised his head and	54.68332290649414
11775/28840	It was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the	49.243961334228516
11776/28840	Although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the	44.87162399291992
11777/28840	Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated	54.6605339050293
11778/28840	No no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death   Edmond still heard the	36.71648025512695
11779/28840	It lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was	75.68031311035156
11780/28840	Some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more	523.2440185546875

11784/28840	Oh if I were only there to help him   Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring	51.95491409301758
11785/28840	He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his	78.41085052490234

11787/28840	He had the resolution to stop with	86.22135162353516

11789/28840	Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchhe did not wish to	38.75542068481445
11790/28840	He soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by	309.87823486328125
11791/28840	Then he said to himself   I must put this to the test but without compromising	45.204185485839844
11792/28840	If it is a workman I need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume	44.8088264465332

11794/28840	Edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound	31.002586364746094
11795/28840	At the first blow the sound ceased as if by	60.98582458496094
11796/28840	Edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wallall was silent	46.35692596435547
11797/28840	Full of hope Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh	44.9833869934082

11800/28840	His brain was on fire and life and energy	987.6378784179688
11801/28840	At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as	90.27091217041016
11802/28840	He moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and	48.85919952392578
11803/28840	Something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a ch	41.20067596435547
11804/28840	Encouraged by this discovery Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable lab	75.33240509033203
11805/28840	He began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a	53.92947006225586
11806/28840	He saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solid	72.02449035644531
11807/28840	All his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a	88.68165588378906
11808/28840	The bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screwdriver to take them	56.89496612548828
11809/28840	The table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been	143.52015686035156
11810/28840	0189m       Dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the	20.02716064453125
11811/28840	He let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in	106.28649139404297
11812/28840	Dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the	31.714204788208008
11813/28840	The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite	137.3673858642578
11814/28840	Edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for	50.36406326293945
11815/28840	All night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his	118.66600036621094
11816/28840	Dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken	31.4576358795166
11817/28840	He returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and	185.743408203125

11819/28840	During the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished   This idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the ston	72.92542266845703
11820/28840	The wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbed	129.76467895507812
11821/28840	It was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its	61.329505920410156
11822/28840	Dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too	28.25819969177246
11823/28840	The fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil Dantès paused with anguish on his	60.443058013916016
11824/28840	Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task Suddenly an idea occurred to himhe smiled and the perspiration dried on his	79.03321838378906
11825/28840	The handle of this saucepan was of iron Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for	29.286508560180664

11827/28840	Now when evening came Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke	30.090534210205078
11828/28840	This time he could not blame Dantè	28.134876251220703
11829/28840	He was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before	38.998390197753906
11830/28840	Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into Dantès entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no	86.19343566894531
11831/28840	Leave the saucepan said Dantès you can take it away when you bring me my	24.29578399658203
11832/28840	This advice was to the jailers taste as it spared him the necessity of making another	70.5535888671875
11833/28840	A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went	95.57062530517578

11838/28840	The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the	35.50065994262695
11839/28840	Well dont you intend to bring me another plate said Dantè	26.43613624572754

11842/28840	I shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into	47.47933578491211
11843/28840	So for the future I hope you will not be so	16.803743362426758
11844/28840	Dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the cover	7.328489303588867
11845/28840	He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for	78.97418975830078
11846/28840	He had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his	58.14543151855469

11849/28840	The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of	107.92711639404297
11850/28840	This would have been a method of reckoning time had not Dantès long ceased to do	43.668399810791016
11851/28840	Having poured out the soup the turnkey	182.20684814453125
11852/28840	Dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to	21.60805892944336

11854/28840	Dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted	16.140348434448242

11856/28840	The iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface Dantès touched it and found that it was a	59.011680603027344

11864/28840	Who are you   Who are you said the	29.03608512878418
11865/28840	An unhappy prisoner replied Dantès who made no hesitation in	63.45415115356445

11904/28840	These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity Dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the	46.47462463378906
11905/28840	He then gave himself up to his	94.1849594116211

11908/28840	All day Dantès walked up and down his	14.303328514099121
11909/28840	He sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his	29.77998924255371
11910/28840	At the slightest noise he bounded towards the	68.51620483398438
11911/28840	Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water	58.37712478637695
11912/28840	He would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to	36.6369514465332
11913/28840	It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished	157.27919006347656
11914/28840	Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said Come are you going mad again   Dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray	31.942398071289062
11915/28840	The jailer went away shaking his	26.740570068359375

11917/28840	The next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his	38.338069915771484
11918/28840	Is it you said he I am	70.29637908935547
11919/28840	Is your jailer gone   Yes said Dantès he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before	24.900510787963867
11920/28840	I can work then said the	141.16807556152344
11921/28840	Oh yes yes this instant I entreat	66.4271240234375
11922/28840	Then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his	48.49382019042969
11923/28840	A Learned Italian   Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired Dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the gr	38.60890197753906
11924/28840	He was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by	108.89217376708984
11925/28840	He had a deepset penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his	51.87469482421875
11926/28840	His thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical	49.328128814697266

11928/28840	The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of	56.740020751953125
11929/28840	He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and	53.6584587097168
11930/28840	He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his	70.69256591796875

11932/28840	Advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said   You removed this stone very carelessly but I suppose you had no tools to aid	52.6456298828125
11933/28840	Why exclaimed Dantès with astonishment do you possess any   I made myself some and with the exception of a file I have all that are necessarya chisel pincers and	42.390533447265625

11939/28840	Do not speak so loud young mandont speak so	201.62986755371094
11940/28840	It frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the	125.63288116455078
11941/28840	But they believe I am shut up alone	218.3449249267578
11942/28840	I expected as I told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea I have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath	43.6727294921875
11943/28840	My labor is all in vain for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with	122.2398452758789

11946/28840	As the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the	125.46478271484375
11947/28840	The young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both	29.209552764892578
11948/28840	An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying I thought so and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the	32.25628662109375
11949/28840	What was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the	27.81715965270996
11950/28840	Yes said he at length it is	19.721281051635742

11952/28840	Are you quite sure of that  	34.0186653137207

11954/28840	You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon   Then pursued the young man	94.59606170654297
11955/28840	Then answered the elder prisoner the will of God be done And as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn count	85.26459503173828
11956/28840	Dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with	23.08472442626953

11961/28840	Pray let me know who you really are   The stranger smiled a melancholy	75.18466186523438
11962/28840	I am the Abbé Faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this Château dIf since the year 1811 previously to which I had been confined for three years in the fortress of Fenestrel	19.03734588623047
11963/28840	In the year 1811 I was transferred to Piedmont in	36.36314392089844
11964/28840	It was at this period I learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of Rome even in his	75.98992919921875

11970/28840	Ah my friend said the abbé turning towards Dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to	22.851797103881836
11971/28840	Probably if ever I get out of prison   True replied Faria we are prisoners but I forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and I fancy myself at	57.558677673339844
11972/28840	It was the plan of Alexander	74.41535949707031
11973/28840	but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and Napoleon was unable to complete his	135.79995727539062
11974/28840	And the old man bowed his	28.91385841369629
11975/28840	Dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such	24.0851993560791

11978/28840	Dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said   Then you abandon all hope of escape   I perceive its utter impossibility and I consider it impious to attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not	38.78910827636719
11979/28840	In the first place I was four years making the tools I possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to	115.80844116210938
11980/28840	No I repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almightys	121.53014373779297
11981/28840	Dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbés	35.94565200805664
11982/28840	The abbé sank upon Edmonds bed while Edmond himself remained	48.67937088012695
11983/28840	Escape had never once occurred to	261.0842590332031

11985/28840	But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new	92.13433837890625
11986/28840	Another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in	83.33759307861328
11987/28840	This same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an	67.19367218017578
11988/28840	And is not above fifteen feet from it   About	86.36775207519531

11993/28840	One instant my dear friend replied the abbé it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed and what use I intend making of my	37.64059829711914
11994/28840	As for patience I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the	52.41863250732422
11995/28840	But then young man and I pray of you to give me your full attention then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyone who had committed no offence and merited not	80.05927276611328
11996/28840	And have your notions changed asked Dantès with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me   No neither do I wish to incur	48.16832733154297
11997/28840	Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not	192.2274627685547
11998/28840	I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but I cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a	82.36931610107422
11999/28840	A slight movement of surprise escaped Dantè	58.34675979614258
12000/28840	Because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of	51.41687774658203
12001/28840	0209m       Since my imprisonment said Faria I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on	34.04530334472656
12002/28840	Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of	84.06570434570312

12004/28840	Ah said Dantès you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage	73.42512512207031
12005/28840	I assure you replied the old man I did not turn to that source for recreation or	51.187583923339844
12006/28840	What did you do then   I wrote or	71.45287322998047
12007/28840	Were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper   Oh no answered the abbé I had none but what I made for	21.055068969726562
12008/28840	You made paper pens and ink  	53.282684326171875

12021/28840	But the ink said Dantès of what did you make your ink   There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied Faria but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this	52.8436393737793
12022/28840	Still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday and I assure you a better ink cannot be	51.48824691772461
12023/28840	For very important notes for which closer attention is required I pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own	95.76942443847656
12024/28840	And when asked Dantès may I see all this   Whenever you please replied the abb	21.42901039123535

12027/28840	The floor of the abbés cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the	22.401582717895508
12028/28840	As he entered the chamber of his friend Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his	48.24946212768555

12031/28840	Look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbé and then observe the lines traced on the	42.751426696777344
12032/28840	This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean that it moved and not the	72.278564453125

12036/28840	Oh your great work on the monarchy of Italy   Faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of pap	40.278255462646484
12037/28840	There said he there is the work	100.22594451904297

12046/28840	One thing still puzzles me observed Dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight   I worked at night also replied Far	47.56334686279297

12050/28840	But how do you procure a light   Oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt	43.72749328613281
12051/28840	And matches   I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily	70.07606506347656
12052/28840	Dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Farias	26.490428924560547

12054/28840	Behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twentyfive and thirty feet in	61.0710334777832
12055/28840	Dantès closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any	79.29708862304688
12056/28840	And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed   Oh no for when I had taken out the thread I required I hemmed the edges over	85.03287506103516
12057/28840	With what   With this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed Dantès a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in	44.748226165771484
12058/28840	Nevertheless I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings	48.55903625488281
12059/28840	What are you thinking of asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and	36.98075485229492
12060/28840	I was reflecting in the first place replied Dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have	28.210346221923828

12066/28840	It was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with	46.63212585449219
12067/28840	Your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important	122.0615463256836

12072/28840	From this point everything was a blank to Dantèshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been	63.024452209472656
12073/28840	His recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnest	42.33693313598633

12082/28840	Now let us return to your particular	133.70509338378906
12083/28840	You say you were on the point of being made captain of the _Pharaon_  	10.096699714660645
12084/28840	And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl  	27.33814811706543
12085/28840	Now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the _Pharaon	56.3947868347168
12086/28840	What say you   I cannot believe such was the	49.324928283691406
12087/28840	I was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on	89.43717956542969
12088/28840	There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards	61.47334671020508

12094/28840	Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone   It might for the cabin door was openandstay now I recollectDanglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marsh	50.266212463378906
12095/28840	Thats better cried the abbé now we are on the right	75.34602355957031
12096/28840	Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba  	32.1864013671875
12097/28840	Somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it I think   Yes the grand marshal	130.61048889160156
12098/28840	And what did you do with that letter   Put it into my	21.29131507873535
12099/28840	You had your portfolio with you then Now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter   You are right it was left on	98.01692962646484
12100/28840	Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio  	37.71407699584961
12101/28840	And what did you do with this same letter while returning from PortoFerrajo to the vessel   I carried it in my	26.035400390625
12102/28840	So that when you went on board the _Pharaon_ everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand  	15.855337142944336
12103/28840	Danglars as well as the rest   Danglars as well as	11.929800033569336
12104/28840	Now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your	118.16403198242188
12105/28840	Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated   Oh yes I read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my	75.41194152832031
12106/28840	This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon	33.5977668762207
12107/28840	The thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole	62.31211471557617
12108/28840	Do you really think so Ah that would indeed be	63.9906005859375
12109/28840	How did Danglars usually write   In a handsome running	125.70550537109375
12110/28840	And how was the anonymous letter written   Back	61.35960388183594
12111/28840	It was very boldly written if	716.5151977539062
12112/28840	Stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the	41.9930534362793
12113/28840	Dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to	20.419893264770508
12114/28840	How very astonishing cried he at	168.7348175048828
12115/28840	Why your writing exactly resembles that of the	186.25213623046875
12116/28840	Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and I have noticed that   What   That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably	48.85468292236328
12117/28840	You have evidently seen and observed	246.9776611328125
12118/28840	Oh yes yes   Now as regards the second	70.6515884399414
12119/28840	Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès   Yes a young man who loved	25.436098098754883
12120/28840	And his name was  	65.08061981201172
12121/28840	That is a Spanish name I think   He was a	48.62700653076172
12122/28840	You imagine him capable of writing the letter   Oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into	69.92142486572266
12123/28840	That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice	40.900638580322266
12124/28840	Besides said Dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to	35.562007904052734
12125/28840	You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone   To no	55.84109115600586
12126/28840	Not even to your mistress   No not even to my betrot	27.811866760253906
12127/28840	I feel quite sure of it	24.343509674072266
12128/28840	Pray was Danglars acquainted with Fernand   Noyes he	76.83432006835938
12129/28840	Now I recollect   What   To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Père Pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my	48.79180145263672
12130/28840	Danglars was joking in a friendly way but Fernand looked pale and	28.346311569213867
12131/28840	Were they alone   There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named Caderousse but he was very	35.039161682128906
12132/28840	StaystayHow strange that it should not have occurred to me before Now I remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and	95.14524841308594
12133/28840	Oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed Dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brow	19.783145904541016
12134/28840	Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends inquired the abbé with a	42.46467208862305
12135/28840	The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily	90.58675384521484
12136/28840	All we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs	118.44395446777344

12138/28840	Pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than I do	140.3253936767578
12139/28840	In the first place then who examined youthe kings attorney his deputy or a magistrate   The	109.93562316894531
12140/28840	Was he young or old   About six or sevenandtwenty years of age I should	38.5623893737793
12141/28840	Old enough to be ambitious but too young to be	103.03511047363281
12142/28840	And how did he treat you   With more of mildness than	68.81813049316406
12143/28840	Did you tell him your whole story   I	46.86526107788086
12144/28840	And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination   He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this	59.6588249206543
12145/28840	He seemed quite overcome by my	245.7842559814453
12146/28840	Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored   He gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any	46.817283630371094
12147/28840	And that   He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated	74.01140594482422
12148/28840	What the accusation   No the	68.77669525146484
12149/28840	Are you sure   I saw it	80.43936157226562
12150/28840	This man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought	96.7761001586914
12151/28840	Upon my word said Dantès you make me	21.225461959838867
12152/28840	Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles   Yes and remember that twolegged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the	33.03207015991211
12153/28840	With all my heart You tell me he burned the letter   He did saying at the same time You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against	66.65119171142578
12154/28840	This action is somewhat too sublime to be	114.40068054199219
12155/28840	You think so   I am sure of	13.284404754638672
12156/28840	To whom was this letter addressed   To	53.371559143066406
12157/28840	What ails you said he at	72.62788391113281
12158/28840	Do you see that ray of sunlight   I	23.371065139770508
12159/28840	Well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to	30.664363861083984
12160/28840	Poor fellow poor young man And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you   He	90.04216003417969
12161/28840	And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter  	72.08808898925781
12162/28840	And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier  	24.329345703125
12163/28840	Starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed His father his father   Yes his father replied the abbé his right name was Noirtier de Ville	24.039337158203125
12164/28840	At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure	34.175880432128906
12165/28840	The change that had come over Villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishmentall returned with a stunning force to his	79.28532409667969
12166/28840	He cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbés cell to his own and said I must be alone to think over all	40.31502914428711
12167/28840	When he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a	46.63947296142578
12168/28840	During these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn	96.8697738647461
12169/28840	Dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his	26.123394012451172
12170/28840	The reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual	70.96765899658203
12171/28840	He was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of	77.27828979492188
12172/28840	Now this was a Sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with	31.846864700317383
12173/28840	Dantès followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate	54.26583480834961
12174/28840	Faria bent on him his penetrating	151.65719604492188
12175/28840	I regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information I	104.63272857666016
12176/28840	Because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of	121.88624572753906
12177/28840	Let us talk of something else said	87.59354400634766
12178/28840	Again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with Dantès request he began to speak of other	28.75881576538086
12179/28840	The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrow	45.39837646484375
12180/28840	Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to	43.89473342895508
12181/28840	You must teach me a small part of what you know said Dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of	46.20439147949219
12182/28840	I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as	63.81828308105469
12183/28840	If you will only agree to my request I promise you never to mention another word about	68.42133331298828
12184/28840	Alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when I have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted you will know as much as I do	52.07256317138672
12185/28840	Now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I	75.09415435791016
12186/28840	Two years exclaimed Dantès do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time   Not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the	61.338951110839844
12187/28840	Memory makes the one philosophy the	189.7999725341797
12188/28840	But cannot one learn philosophy   Philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into	85.3388671875
12189/28840	Well then said Dantès What shall you teach me first I am in a hurry to	27.14495849609375
12190/28840	And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following	73.45537567138672
12191/28840	In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé Dantès spoke no more of	31.197580337524414
12192/28840	Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of	110.03211975097656
12193/28840	Days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive	178.66116333007812
12194/28840	At the end of a year Dantès was a new	18.065237045288086
12195/28840	Dantès observed however that Faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his	52.70927810668945
12196/28840	Sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his	76.2861328125
12197/28840	I have already told you answered the abbé that I loathe the idea of shedding	14.894966125488281
12198/28840	And yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of selfpres	52.57667922973633
12199/28840	No matter I could never agree to	144.60104370117188
12200/28840	Still you have thought of it   Incessantly alas cried the abb	13.003259658813477
12201/28840	And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked Dantès	26.890390396118164
12202/28840	I have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond	108.85636138916016
12203/28840	He shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion	35.95695495605469
12204/28840	No no cried the abbé impossible   Dantès endeavored to renew the subject the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further	14.52578067779541
12205/28840	Are you strong the abbé asked one day of Dantè	26.82881736755371
12206/28840	The young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened	48.326194763183594
12207/28840	And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort   I promise on my	47.68065643310547
12208/28840	Then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into	27.68233299255371
12209/28840	And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work   At least a	33.924137115478516
12210/28840	And shall we begin at once   At	45.68436813354492
12211/28840	We have lost a year to no purpose cried Dantè	40.120094299316406
12212/28840	Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb	33.93392562866211
12213/28840	Tut tut answered the abbé man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever	94.60738372802734
12214/28840	Come let me show you my	50.779273986816406
12215/28840	The abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their	31.677978515625
12216/28840	It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès with the passage which united	43.314552307128906
12217/28840	The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbés ladder of	56.029293060302734
12218/28840	Dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to	33.71428680419922
12219/28840	That very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate	75.76903533935547
12220/28840	Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys	134.82650756835938
12221/28840	They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his	72.870849609375
12222/28840	At the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their	46.20792770385742
12223/28840	Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria who had remained in Edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great	28.513322830200195
12224/28840	Dantès hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly	14.923317909240723
12225/28840	Gracious heavens exclaimed Dantès what is the matter what has happened   Quick quick returned the abbé listen to what I have to	12.904670715332031
12226/28840	Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on	37.512664794921875
12227/28840	Tell me I beseech you what ails you cried Dantès letting his chisel fall to the	27.41476821899414
12228/28840	Alas faltered out the abbé all is over with	50.89546585083008
12229/28840	I am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness I can feel that the paroxysm is fast	95.35089874267578
12230/28840	I had a similar attack the year previous to my	145.19198608398438
12231/28840	This malady admits but of one remedy I will tell you what that	51.701942443847656
12232/28840	Go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there halffilled with a redlooking	39.78556823730469
12233/28840	Bring it to meor ratherno noI may be found here therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself	100.09823608398438
12234/28840	Thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with	23.027549743652344
12235/28840	I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor gro	43.29749298095703
12236/28840	On the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out	83.89830780029297
12237/28840	Take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated	58.929290771484375
12238/28840	When I become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not beforebe careful about thisforce open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and I may perhaps	101.0361099243164
12239/28840	The fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a	82.47956085205078
12240/28840	Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the	129.12066650390625
12241/28840	An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning	77.76174926757812
12242/28840	Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his	29.87937355041504
12243/28840	At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to	60.70853805541992
12244/28840	He is saved he is saved cried Dantès in a paroxysm of	16.063173294067383
12245/28840	The sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the	36.14128875732422
12246/28840	Dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jail	37.57611846923828
12247/28840	It was therefore near seven oclock but Edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his	55.84325408935547
12248/28840	The young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his	54.21506118774414
12249/28840	He had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his	23.487524032592773
12250/28840	Faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable	87.45431518554688
12251/28840	I did not expect to see you again said he feebly to Dantè	10.228334426879883
12252/28840	And why not asked the young	35.40336227416992
12253/28840	Did you fancy yourself dying   No I had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight I thought you might have made your	46.26231384277344
12254/28840	The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantè	32.76325607299805
12255/28840	Without you Did you really think me capable of that   At least said the abbé I now see how wrong such an opinion would have	35.88121795654297
12256/28840	Alas alas I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this	84.94562530517578
12257/28840	Be of good cheer replied Dantès your strength will	75.94656372070312
12258/28840	And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria and took his	26.66778564453125
12259/28840	The third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for	89.39559936523438
12260/28840	No no cried Dantès you are mistakenyou will not die And your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at	34.78326416015625
12261/28840	We shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite	63.765872955322266
12262/28840	My good Edmond answered the abbé be not	57.374507904052734
12263/28840	The attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a	62.67889404296875
12264/28840	None can fly from a dungeon who cannot	286.1072692871094
12265/28840	Well we will waita week a month two months if need beand meanwhile your strength will	150.5922088623047
12266/28840	Everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we	71.99032592773438
12267/28840	As soon as you feel able to swim we will	141.17897033691406
12268/28840	I shall never swim again replied Far	51.330135345458984
12269/28840	This arm is paralyzed not for a time but	154.9439697265625
12270/28840	Lift it and judge if I am	526.37158203125
12271/28840	The young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and	88.66990661621094
12272/28840	You are convinced now Edmond are you not asked the abb	32.58479309082031
12273/28840	Depend upon it I know what I	264.85198974609375
12274/28840	Since the first attack I experienced of this malady I have continually reflected on	76.67840576171875
12275/28840	Indeed I expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third	66.74593353271484
12276/28840	The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated Cabanis and he predicted a similar end for	70.6613540649414
12277/28840	0233m       The physician may be mistaken exclaimed Dantè	16.49779510498047
12278/28840	And as for your poor arm what difference will that make I can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of	158.144775390625
12279/28840	My son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty	52.856956481933594
12280/28840	Cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe	102.7467269897461
12281/28840	Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my	29.318281173706055
12282/28840	As for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoI give you back your	64.5039291381836
12283/28840	Then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old mans head he slowly added By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you	62.82635498046875
12284/28840	Faria gazed fondly on his nobleminded singlehearted highprincipled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his	59.88215637207031
12285/28840	Thanks murmured the invalid extending one	39.90556716918945
12286/28840	You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested	53.32285690307617
12287/28840	But as I cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the	61.05038833618164
12288/28840	That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being	118.2391586303711
12289/28840	Go then and set about this work in which unhappily I can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited	71.74663543701172
12290/28840	I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to	18.467771530151367
12291/28840	Dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed	12.596982955932617
12292/28840	Faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged	53.80662536621094
12293/28840	The Treasure   When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found Faria seated and looking	40.46613311767578
12294/28840	He did not speak but showed the paper to Dantè	28.515460968017578
12295/28840	Look at it said the abbé with a	11.738605499267578
12296/28840	I have looked at it with all possible attention said Dantès and I only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of	30.793460845947266
12297/28840	This paper my friend said Faria I may now avow to you since I have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to	56.853660583496094
12298/28840	The sweat started forth on Dantès	41.41857147216797
12299/28840	Until this day and for how long a timehe had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of	51.81108474731445
12300/28840	With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and Faria had been equally	60.59493637084961
12301/28840	He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by Faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental	67.42283630371094
12302/28840	You have indeed a noble nature Edmond and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this	46.907962799072266
12303/28840	No be assured I am not	51.14031982421875
12304/28840	This treasure exists Dantès and if I have not been allowed to possess it you	32.813865661621094
12305/28840	No one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that I am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you	74.254150390625
12306/28840	Alas murmured Edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse There was only this blow	61.98533248901367
12307/28840	Then he said aloud My dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile Tomorrow if you will I will hear your narrative but today I wish to nurse you	66.8610610961914
12308/28840	Besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry	134.14105224609375
12309/28840	On the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance Edmond replied the old	22.220611572265625
12310/28840	This idea was one of vengeance to me and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my	42.508277893066406
12311/28840	Edmond turned away his head with a	18.559953689575195
12312/28840	You persist in your incredulity Edmond continued Far	86.38624572753906
12313/28840	Well then read this paper which I have never shown to	51.9476432800293
12314/28840	Tomorrow my dear friend said Edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans	22.193296432495117
12315/28840	I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until	43.818702697753906
12316/28840	Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper	73.52906799316406
12317/28840	I will not irritate him thought Edmond and taking the paper of which half was wantinghaving been burnt no doubt by some accidenthe read   this treasure which may amount to	104.89319610595703
12318/28840	of Roman crowns in the most distant	36.53488540649414
12319/28840	25th April 149     Well said Faria when the young man had finished reading	21.253211975097656
12320/28840	Why replied Dantès I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by	42.87234115600586
12321/28840	Yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every	85.61239624023438
12322/28840	And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning   I am sure I have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this	36.040950775146484
12323/28840	It was the governor who hearing of Farias illness from the jailer had come in person to see	35.31119155883789
12324/28840	Faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with	70.34956359863281
12325/28840	His fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young	118.10167694091797
12326/28840	But fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indis	39.263797760009766
12327/28840	During this time Edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered	30.97015380859375
12328/28840	Faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with	51.30193328857422
12329/28840	Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one	40.79045867919922
12330/28840	Edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dantès	18.75214195251465
12331/28840	Here I am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant	52.95293426513672
12332/28840	You thought to escape my munificence but it is in	79.2964859008789
12333/28840	Edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside	22.56926155090332
12334/28840	You know said the abbé that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada the last of the princes of that	39.64616012573242
12335/28840	I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever	166.51589965820312
12336/28840	He was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and I heard the phrase very often As rich as a Sp	98.37227630615234

12339/28840	The cardinals house had no secrets for	60.137691497802734
12340/28840	I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family	81.68031311035156
12341/28840	One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the History of the City of	41.90513229370117

12345/28840	By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome especially rich men_this_ was the return the Holy Father looked	168.5194091796875
12346/28840	In the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell	82.43536376953125
12347/28840	There was a third point in view which will appear	150.1787872314453
12348/28840	They were ambitious and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their	19.305421829223633
12349/28840	The result was that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the spec	50.193782806396484
12350/28840	0239m       It is time now to proceed to the last part of the	23.38886070251465
12351/28840	The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at	41.9721565246582
12352/28840	Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two cardinals to	15.325629234313965
12353/28840	This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his	30.82501792907715
12354/28840	Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cup	45.14271926879883
12355/28840	This key was furnished with a small iron pointa negligence on the part of the locks	74.706787109375
12356/28840	When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next	100.29315948486328
12357/28840	Then there was the ring with the lions head which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the	33.013492584228516
12358/28840	The lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twentyfour hours the bite was	83.41642761230469
12359/28840	Cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but Alexander	37.55693817138672
12360/28840	replied Now as to the worthy cardinals Spada and Rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money	55.42495346069336
12361/28840	Besides you forget Cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or	70.88577270507812
12362/28840	Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to	48.047096252441406
12363/28840	The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near San Pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by	49.93300247192383
12364/28840	Rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating	73.99231719970703
12365/28840	Spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his	115.1851806640625
12366/28840	He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find	49.02339172363281
12367/28840	Spada knew what these invitations meant since Christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in Rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message Cæsar wills that you	103.99635314941406
12368/28840	but it was a legate _à latere_ who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope His holiness requests you to dine with	44.6500129699707
12369/28840	Spada set out about two oclock to San Pierdare	49.964073181152344
12370/28840	The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew in full costume and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked attent	44.15974807739258
12371/28840	Spada turned pale as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well	32.915687561035156
12372/28840	They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his	105.51132202148438
12373/28840	The nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the	133.5469970703125
12374/28840	It was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes but	65.91647338867188
12375/28840	Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to	145.59486389160156

12378/28840	Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead	30.670446395874023
12379/28840	The heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that Spada the rich man was really the most miserable of unclesno treasuresunless they were those of science contained in the library and	76.81966400146484
12380/28840	They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruit	65.16507720947266
12381/28840	There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his	56.8192138671875

12384/28840	After the popes death and his sons exile it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinals time but this was not the	44.534942626953125
12385/28840	The Spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that Cæsar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two card	60.66322326660156

12391/28840	He did so and thus doubled his	235.6781768798828
12392/28840	The celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the counts	48.525943756103516

12395/28840	I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the gen	31.717493057250977

12400/28840	0243m       I awoke as the clock was striking	32.229888916015625
12401/28840	I raised my head I was in utter	48.540618896484375
12402/28840	I rang for a light but as no one came I determined to find one for	90.26019287109375
12403/28840	It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of	83.50565338134766
12404/28840	I took a waxcandle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my matchbox being empty with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the em	52.171600341796875
12405/28840	I felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to	70.40288543701172
12406/28840	But beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended I saw yellowish characters appear on the	62.80074691772461
12407/28840	It was that paper you read this morning read it again Dantès and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected	79.27406311035156
12408/28840	Faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to Dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust        This 25th day of April 1498	32.3704833984375

12441/28840	It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada and the will so long sought for replied Edmond still incred	74.93877410888672
12442/28840	Yes a thousand times yes   And who completed it as it now is   I	44.18928146362305
12443/28840	Aided by the remaining fragment I guessed the rest measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above	95.67539978027344
12444/28840	Now continued Faria addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as I do	19.256025314331055
12445/28840	If we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if I die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to	122.94981384277344

12450/28840	2   Impossible said Dantès staggered at the enormous	20.911792755126953
12451/28840	Impossible and why asked the old	133.21380615234375
12452/28840	Edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and	69.04960632324219
12453/28840	I have only kept this secret so long from you continued Faria that I might test your character and then surprise	64.68599700927734
12454/28840	Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me th	32.73322677612305
12455/28840	Well Dantès you do not thank me   This treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied Dantès and to you	15.713027000427246
12456/28840	You are my son Dantès exclaimed the old	18.60407066345215
12457/28840	You are the child of my	76.71475982666016
12458/28840	God has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get	58.76028823852539
12459/28840	And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and we	59.220054626464844
12460/28840	The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo but Dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twentyfive miles from Pianosa between Corsica and the Island of Elba and had once touched	17.96295166015625
12461/28840	This island was always had been and still is completely	418.2575988769531
12462/28840	It is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the	44.024559020996094
12463/28840	Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the	34.65190505981445
12464/28840	But Dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old	31.80998420715332
12465/28840	However as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was	87.82377624511719
12466/28840	They had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled	84.29325866699219
12467/28840	But for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to Edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been	34.66009521484375
12468/28840	Thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their	48.059593200683594
12469/28840	You see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to Faria that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to	46.41081619262695
12470/28840	I have promised to remain forever with you and now I could not break my promise if I	29.72707748413086
12471/28840	The treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this	98.12496185302734
12472/28840	These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themthis is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and	48.370025634765625
12473/28840	I owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even Cæsar Borgia himself could not deprive me of	27.774818420410156
12474/28840	Thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went	197.36676025390625
12475/28840	Faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of	50.4359245300293
12476/28840	As he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it	57.780372619628906
12477/28840	But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would	90.56977844238281
12478/28840	For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart and Dantès knew it from the first to the last	45.209774017333984
12479/28840	Then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real	73.62358856201172
12480/28840	Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantèsinstructions which were to serve him when he was at	76.11565399169922
12481/28840	In the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least toler	168.85804748535156
12482/28840	They were thus perpetually employedFaria that he might not see himself grow old Dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the	38.69322967529297
12483/28840	So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of	75.87547302246094
12484/28840	But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when Faria was left alone and when Edmond returned to his	37.80427551269531
12485/28840	One night Edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling	93.70365905761719
12486/28840	He opened his eyes upon utter	98.31111907958984
12487/28840	His name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached	73.06446838378906
12488/28840	He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his	40.85908889770508
12489/28840	Undoubtedly the call came from Farias	105.57901763916016
12490/28840	Alas murmured Edmond can it be   He moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was	31.243215560913086
12491/28840	By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken Dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bed	33.41667175292969
12492/28840	His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first	51.694091796875
12493/28840	Silence he said or you are	207.7607421875
12494/28840	We must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight	79.5265121459961
12495/28840	It would require years to do again what I have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each	65.98226165771484
12496/28840	Besides be assured my dear Edmond the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of	72.47258758544922
12497/28840	Perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while I have been but a hind	56.56159973144531
12498/28840	You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your	72.98076629638672
12499/28840	At length Providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time I should	79.55322265625
12500/28840	See he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic dra	80.44561767578125
12501/28840	Quick quick tell me what I must do this time are there any fresh instructions Speak my friend I	90.411865234375
12502/28840	Oh yes yes exclaimed Dantès and I tell you that I will save you	22.92180633544922
12503/28840	I feel the blood flowing towards my	143.92758178710938
12504/28840	These horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a	52.203155517578125
12505/28840	Oh exclaimed Dantès his heart wrung with	36.45122146606445
12506/28840	Do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to	92.16681671142578
12507/28840	If after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that I do not recover then pour the rest down my	73.86621856689453
12508/28840	Now lift me on my bed for I can no longer support	49.031455993652344
12509/28840	Edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the	17.165199279785156
12510/28840	My son I bless thee   The young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans	32.38850784301758
12511/28840	Listen now to what I say in this my dying	164.05270385742188
12512/28840	God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or	208.0883331298828
12513/28840	I see it in the depths of the inner	23.012836456298828
12514/28840	My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much	37.56916046142578
12515/28840	If you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not	70.83792877197266
12516/28840	Hasten to Monte Cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered long	78.05586242675781
12517/28840	A violent convulsion attacked the old	69.42749786376953
12518/28840	Dantès raised his head and saw Farias eyes injected with	15.60089111328125
12519/28840	It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the	50.111846923828125
12520/28840	Oh yes yes be assured I shall save you Besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were	40.368221282958984
12521/28840	Do not mistake I suffer less because there is in me less strength to	184.36228942871094
12522/28840	At your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more	156.4819793701172
12523/28840	The crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested	73.25564575195312
12524/28840	Dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened	36.31071090698242
12525/28840	With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the rest	182.61026000976562
12526/28840	When he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much	77.22911071777344
12527/28840	He waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hourno change took	28.787670135498047
12528/28840	Trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his	42.23133087158203
12529/28840	Then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his	41.21284866333008
12530/28840	It was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the	35.758872985839844
12531/28840	Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of	50.18379211425781
12532/28840	While the struggle between day and night lasted Dantès still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a	33.87125015258789
12533/28840	Then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vainthey opened again as soon as	73.4585952758789
12534/28840	He extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he	61.99269104003906
12535/28840	It was time for the jailer was	39.031837463378906
12536/28840	On this occasion he began his rounds at Dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to Farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some	47.67929458618164
12537/28840	Nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had	43.912567138671875
12538/28840	Dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate	14.59245777130127
12539/28840	He therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for	24.23929214477539
12540/28840	Other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of	265.7209167480469
12541/28840	Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the	50.713558197021484
12542/28840	The governor then went out and words of pity fell on Dantès listening ears mingled with brutal	94.78267669677734
12543/28840	Well well said one the madman has gone to look after his	128.89385986328125
12544/28840	Good journey to him   With all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said	51.01469039916992
12545/28840	They may give him the honors of the	100.42687225341797
12546/28840	Edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was	34.15678405761719
12547/28840	The voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the	75.96275329589844
12548/28840	Still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the	53.891395568847656
12549/28840	He remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to	44.096378326416016
12550/28840	At the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which	36.99207305908203
12551/28840	It was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other	63.482234954833984
12552/28840	There was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead	29.5146427154541
12553/28840	The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was	34.315242767333984
12554/28840	Questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his	47.309288024902344
12555/28840	I am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no	49.99220657348633
12556/28840	Ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years Ill answer for it without any attempt to	47.960514068603516
12557/28840	Still said the governor I believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that I doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is	55.74592971801758
12558/28840	There was a moment of complete silence during which Dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second	26.98211669921875
12559/28840	You may make your mind easy said the doctor he is	26.7763671875
12560/28840	You know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple	83.53604125976562
12561/28840	In spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by	79.20687866210938
12562/28840	Let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless	58.39686584472656
12563/28840	This order to heat the irons made Dantès	47.840816497802734
12564/28840	He heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying   Here is the brazier light	55.3690299987793
12565/28840	There was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in	41.36321258544922
12566/28840	The perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should	39.9902458190918
12567/28840	You see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is	112.20658874511719
12568/28840	The poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his	126.7449722290039
12569/28840	Wasnt his name Faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the	90.1611328125
12570/28840	0259m       Yes sir and as he said it was an ancient	17.774106979370117
12571/28840	He was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure but on that indeed he was intract	77.6260757446289
12572/28840	It is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the	47.64302444458008
12573/28840	You had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abb	36.16718292236328
12574/28840	Never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me	44.749515533447266
12575/28840	One day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured	107.41974639892578
12576/28840	Ah ah said the doctor I did not know that I had a rival but I hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in	45.93503189086914
12577/28840	Yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can	40.68377685546875
12578/28840	Will that satisfy you   Must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turn	75.05899810791016
12579/28840	But make hasteI cannot stay here all	125.9978256225586
12580/28840	Will there be any mass asked one of the	113.54206848144531
12581/28840	The chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to Hyères for a	43.322669982910156
12582/28840	I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his	48.6699104309082
12583/28840	If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requ	17.959491729736328
12584/28840	Pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a church	54.96094512939453
12585/28840	God will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a	89.6916275024414
12586/28840	A shout of laughter followed this brutal j	371.12969970703125
12587/28840	Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going	76.14346313476562
12588/28840	This evening said the governor when the task was	64.32633209228516
12589/28840	Shall we watch by the corpse   Of what use would it be Shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is	56.226837158203125
12590/28840	Then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the	29.919057846069336
12591/28840	It was empty and Dantès emerged from the	23.377910614013672
12592/28840	A barrier had been placed between Dantès and his old	20.42719268798828
12593/28840	No longer could Edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence	83.66859436035156
12594/28840	Faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer	49.69729995727539
12595/28840	He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy rever	30.420385360717773
12596/28840	If I could die he said I should go where he goes and should assuredly find him	53.59560012817383
12597/28840	But how to die It is very easy he went on with a smile I will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine	38.65178298950195
12598/28840	But excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the	42.242462158203125
12599/28840	Dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and	68.77863311767578
12600/28840	Die oh no he exclaimednot die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much Die yes had I died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of	118.65673065185547
12601/28840	No I want to live I shall struggle to the very last I will yet win back the happiness of which I have been	46.125572204589844
12602/28840	Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to	99.00350189208984
12603/28840	Yet they will forget me here and I shall die in my dungeon like Far	45.83716583251953
12604/28840	As he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing	89.65827941894531
12605/28840	Suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the	32.44871139526367
12606/28840	He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that	36.64573669433594
12607/28840	Dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed	34.6030387878418
12608/28840	In that case his last hope would have been	134.9866943359375
12609/28840	Now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to	53.77589797973633
12610/28840	He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome	47.43598937988281
12611/28840	If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and thenso much the better all would be	54.247684478759766
12612/28840	Dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it	13.44747543334961
12613/28840	His situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but	133.84829711914062
12614/28840	This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to Dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover	39.31901168823242
12615/28840	When seven oclock came Dantès agony really	73.27951049804688
12616/28840	His hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his	23.981170654296875
12617/28840	From time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of	59.1236686706543
12618/28840	Then he thought he was going to	25.709333419799805
12619/28840	Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and Dantès knew that he had escaped the first	38.45774841308594
12620/28840	At length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the	82.93688201904297
12621/28840	Edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his	34.00797653198242
12622/28840	The footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand Dantès guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handb	38.10884475708008
12623/28840	The door opened and a dim light reached Dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its	36.35418701171875
12624/28840	The two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extrem	98.56670379638672
12625/28840	Hes heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the	211.87583923339844
12626/28840	They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the	146.3596954345703
12627/28840	Have you tied the knot inquired the first	250.093505859375
12628/28840	What would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply I can do that when we get	53.69268798828125
12629/28840	They deposited the supposed corpse on the b	216.1504364013672
12630/28840	Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the	41.125770568847656
12631/28840	Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and Dantès knew that the mistral was	38.9952278137207
12632/28840	It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely ming	98.6302261352539
12633/28840	The bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the	108.43708801269531
12634/28840	One of them went away and Dantès heard his shoes striking on the	26.62327766418457
12635/28840	Really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the handbar	51.57944869995117
12636/28840	Dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt	22.22992706298828
12637/28840	Give us a light said the other bearer or I shall never find what I am looking	63.58115005493164
12638/28840	The man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite	163.65174865722656
12639/28840	What can he be looking for thought Ed	107.59234619140625
12640/28840	An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found the object of his	37.435935974121094
12641/28840	Here it is at last he said not without some trouble	123.79658508300781
12642/28840	Yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by	143.3118438720703
12643/28840	As he said this the man came towards Edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful	37.96464538574219
12644/28840	Well have you tied the knot inquired the gravedigger who was looking	29.630964279174805
12645/28840	Yes and pretty tight too I can tell you was the	86.31636810302734
12646/28840	And the bier was lifted once more and they	152.49110412597656
12647/28840	They advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward	41.11186218261719
12648/28840	The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the château is built reached Dantès ear distinctly as they went	37.190208435058594
12649/28840	Bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the	94.82015228271484
12650/28840	Why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal	50.48154067993164
12651/28840	Dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his	15.724621772766113
12652/28840	Well here we are at last said one of	29.12394905090332
12653/28840	A little farthera little farther said the	442.0985107421875
12654/28840	You know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless	73.95545959472656
12655/28840	They ascended five or six more steps and then Dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and	39.219627380371094
12656/28840	One said the gravediggers two three   And at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curd	38.87251281738281
12657/28840	Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a	57.49418640136719
12658/28840	At last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the	48.57569885253906
12659/28840	Dantès had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirtysixpound shot tied to his	19.4118595123291
12660/28840	The sea is the cemetery of the Château d	17.11674690246582
12661/28840	He then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually str	33.539302825927734
12662/28840	With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his	59.23716735839844
12663/28840	Dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being	26.895971298217773
12664/28840	When he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first	38.49118423461914
12665/28840	Behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two	91.6812744140625
12666/28840	He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange gravediggers had heard his	48.93006896972656
12667/28840	Dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the	22.045297622680664
12668/28840	This was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the	43.40752029418945
12669/28840	When he came up again the light had	87.79517364501953
12670/28840	Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Château dIf but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of Da	36.62684631347656
12671/28840	Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès	82.62071228027344
12672/28840	The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château dIf Dantès nevertheless determined to make for	22.673839569091797
12673/28840	But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night   At this moment he saw the light of Planier gleaming in front of him like a	23.131074905395508
12674/28840	By leaving this light on the right he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find	68.86869049072266
12675/28840	But as we have said it was at least a league from the Château dIf to this	10.877189636230469
12676/28840	These words rang in Dantès ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his	40.16872787475586
12677/28840	He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a	48.51994323730469
12678/28840	Fear that relentless pursuer clogged Dantès	43.84389877319336
12679/28840	He listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the	54.04318618774414
12680/28840	He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his	68.650390625
12681/28840	He swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the	98.50163269042969
12682/28840	He could not see it but he _felt_ its	96.43177032470703
12683/28840	An hour passed during which Dantès excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the	38.67245864868164
12684/28840	Let us see said he I have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if I am not mistaken I must be close to Tiboul	63.636474609375
12685/28840	But what if I were mistaken   A shudder passed over	33.5718879699707
12686/28840	He sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuper	42.03838348388672
12687/28840	Well said he I will swim on until I am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then I shall sink and he struck out with the energy of	62.82378005981445
12688/28840	Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his	28.639028549194336
12689/28840	He fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard	37.94762420654297
12690/28840	Then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the	39.56502151489258
12691/28840	Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent	53.8565788269043
12692/28840	Dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than	25.458473205566406
12693/28840	Then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter	37.98872756958008
12694/28840	At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of	52.51082229614258
12695/28840	The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic	43.76070022583008
12696/28840	Dantès had not been deceivedhe had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact Tiboul	22.155406951904297
12697/28840	He knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to Lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for conceal	103.5773696899414
12698/28840	An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its	53.84476852416992
12699/28840	Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their	74.09774780273438
12700/28840	He was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the	36.06802749633789
12701/28840	It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the	45.8936882019043
12702/28840	He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for fourandtwenty	19.277177810668945
12703/28840	He extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the	58.12147903442383
12704/28840	As he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the	46.3210334777832
12705/28840	By its light between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle a quarter of a league distant Dantès saw a fishingboat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and	29.08751678466797
12706/28840	A second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapid	84.58783721923828
12707/28840	Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it	36.853515625
12708/28840	Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rud	73.8900375366211
12709/28840	The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the	151.2815399169922
12710/28840	Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast seab	73.8704833984375
12711/28840	At the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of	51.21337890625
12712/28840	Dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless	95.61246490478516
12713/28840	Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to	53.33693313598633
12714/28840	By degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright	54.77677536010742
12715/28840	Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with	36.851585388183594
12716/28840	Dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the Château dIf he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be	27.502206802368164
12717/28840	He turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and	241.7822723388672
12718/28840	The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the	61.230037689208984
12719/28840	In two or three hours thought Dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the	73.81365966796875
12720/28840	Then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered will be	59.54511642456055
12721/28840	Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched	249.7106475830078
12722/28840	The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and fam	208.0190887451172
12723/28840	The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by	52.7503776550293
12724/28840	I have lost even the knife that saved	154.4955596923828

12726/28840	She was coming out of Marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the	64.2340087890625
12727/28840	In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps I have not been missed at the	90.658447265625
12728/28840	I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last	50.48363494873047
12729/28840	My story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict	86.67420196533203
12730/28840	As he spoke Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishingvessel had been wrecked and	35.66545104980469
12731/28840	The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessels keel floated at the foot of the cr	35.554344177246094
12732/28840	In an instant Dantès plan was	36.933189392089844
12733/28840	He swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was	68.80464935302734
12734/28840	He soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the Château dIf and the tower of Plan	24.44550132751465
12735/28840	For an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for Italy between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraign	55.09452819824219
12736/28840	However the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of	35.34676742553711
12737/28840	He rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another	70.01321411132812
12738/28840	Dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his	29.482696533203125
12739/28840	It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting	82.87315368652344
12740/28840	Dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards	100.99507904052734
12741/28840	Then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her	88.93667602539062
12742/28840	By a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to	52.26690673828125
12743/28840	This time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards	42.27289581298828
12744/28840	At the same time he saw they were about to lower the	34.675880432128906
12745/28840	An instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards	63.493255615234375
12746/28840	Dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet	42.991146087646484
12747/28840	But he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to	86.4932861328125
12748/28840	His arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breath	163.47633361816406
12749/28840	The two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in Italian Courage   The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his	49.825523376464844
12750/28840	He rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his	54.14348602294922
12751/28840	The water passed over his head and the sky turned	50.41739273071289
12752/28840	A convulsive movement again brought him to the	83.09395599365234
12753/28840	He felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard	97.30718231201172
12754/28840	When he opened his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the tart	14.15424919128418
12755/28840	His first care was to see what course they were	136.55291748046875
12756/28840	They were rapidly leaving the Château dIf	24.16950035095215
12757/28840	Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a	28.762704849243164
12758/28840	As we have said he was lying on the	34.937049865722656
12759/28840	A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elastic	77.8875503540039
12760/28840	Who are you said the pilot in bad	136.59259033203125
12761/28840	I am replied Dantès in bad Italian a Maltese	32.66645431518555
12762/28840	We were coming from Syracuse laden with	106.25532531738281
12763/28840	The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou and we were wrecked on these	58.45668029785156
12764/28840	Where do you come from   From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all	64.11078643798828
12765/28840	I saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your	60.776371002197266
12766/28840	You have saved my life and I thank you continued Dantè	18.1101131439209
12767/28840	I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my	54.870731353759766
12768/28840	It was I said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were	99.104248046875
12769/28840	Yes returned Dantès holding out his hand I thank you	18.563051223754883
12770/28840	I almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot	125.44318389892578
12771/28840	Dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Château d	13.997063636779785
12772/28840	Yes said he I made a vow to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow	55.7333869934082
12773/28840	Now what are we to do with you said the	20.34136962890625
12774/28840	My captain is dead I have barely escaped but I am a good	102.96562194824219
12775/28840	Leave me at the first port you make I shall be sure to find	60.69279098510742
12776/28840	Do you know the Mediterranean   I have sailed over it since my	50.28981399536133
12777/28840	You know the best harbors   There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my	57.01810073852539
12778/28840	I say captain said the sailor who had cried Courage to Dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us   If he says true said the captain doubting	46.099464416503906
12779/28840	But in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it	101.47369384765625
12780/28840	I will do more than I promise said Dantè	12.125787734985352
12781/28840	We shall see returned the other	107.22032165527344
12782/28840	Then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind   Because we should run straight on to the Island of R	66.48213958740234
12783/28840	You shall pass it by twenty fath	103.35091400146484

12787/28840	This order was also executed and the vessel passed as Dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to wind	55.9219970703125

12791/28840	Ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are	34.5116081237793
12792/28840	Give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned Dantè	43.23097229003906
12793/28840	Thats not fair said the seaman who had saved Dantès for you know more than we	81.82876586914062

12797/28840	Well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have	32.06324768066406
12798/28840	No said Jacopo but I have a shirt and a pair of	18.750507354736328
12799/28840	That is all I want interrupted Dantè	23.706087112426758
12800/28840	Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond	110.81661987304688

12807/28840	Hollo whats the matter at the Château dIf said the	58.597389221191406
12808/28840	A small white cloud which had attracted Dantès attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d	19.150094985961914
12809/28840	At the same moment the faint report of a gun was	49.93872833251953
12810/28840	A prisoner has escaped from the Château dIf and they are firing the alarm gun replied Dantè	25.396650314331055
12811/28840	The captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died	52.28301239013672

12814/28840	Dantès could thus keep his eyes on Marse	25.37748146057129
12815/28840	What is the day of the month asked he of Jacopo who sat down beside	27.33832359313965
12816/28840	I ask you what year is it   The year 1829 returned Jacop	16.010452270507812
12817/28840	It was fourteen years day for day since Dantès	80.51799011230469
12818/28840	He was nineteen when he entered the Château dIf he was thirtythree when he	22.59836196899414
12819/28840	A sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of Mercédès who must believe him	23.952190399169922
12820/28840	Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a	46.93186950683594
12821/28840	He renewed against Danglars Fernand and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his	35.619598388671875
12822/28840	This oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Legh	56.02082443237305
12823/28840	The Smugglers   Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been	26.033729553222656
12824/28840	It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smugg	20.190290451049805
12825/28840	At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of	27.856216430664062
12826/28840	This made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his	41.83625793457031
12827/28840	Thus the Genoese subtle as he was was duped by Edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation	26.751901626586914
12828/28840	Moreover it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should	28.07862663269043
12829/28840	In this state of mutual understanding they reached Legh	58.2078742980957
12830/28840	Here Edmond was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen	47.932987213134766
12831/28840	He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had	47.234596252441406
12832/28840	His comrades believed that his vow was	523.4356689453125
12833/28840	As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn he remembered a barber in	54.927120208740234
12834/28840	Ferdinand Street he went there to have his beard and hair	1778.4630126953125
12835/28840	The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of Titians	38.40666580200195
12836/28840	At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of	53.426605224609375
12837/28840	The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to	100.66285705566406
12838/28840	When the operation was concluded and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking	44.62211990356445

12840/28840	Dantès had entered the Château dIf with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his	30.82986068725586

12842/28840	As to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost ho	76.71533966064453
12843/28840	Moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the	58.14088439941406
12844/28840	Edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendif indeed he had any friend leftcould recognize him he could not recognize	51.697261810302734
12845/28840	The master of _La Jeune Amélie_ who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmonds value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which Edmond had	23.801250457763672
12846/28840	His next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a	94.35369873046875
12847/28840	Attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dantès but Dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three	39.625850677490234
12848/28840	_La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as	60.54572296142578

12850/28840	The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of Corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to	71.26773834228516

12852/28840	He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left and went towards the country of Paoli and	71.65087127685547
12853/28840	The next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found Dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy	48.88715744018555
12854/28840	It was the Island of Monte Crist	10.812193870544434
12855/28840	_La Jeune Amélie_ left it threequarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Cors	29.441383361816406
12856/28840	Dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised	31.6804256439209
12857/28840	But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself Besides what would the sailors say What would the patron think He must	104.732421875
12858/28840	Fortunately Dantès had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for	32.726890563964844
12859/28840	Dantès noticed that the captain of _La Jeune Amélie_ had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or	35.77851104736328
12860/28840	But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and polit	36.43780517578125
12861/28840	The same night such a man of regularity was the patron of _La Jeune Amélie_ the profits were divided and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres or about eighty franc	29.428712844848633
12862/28840	They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been	88.7523422241211
12863/28840	The second operation was as successful as the first _La Jeune Amélie_ was in	20.845623016357422
12864/28840	This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars sherry and Malaga	73.9696044921875
12865/28840	There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune Amélie	25.237051010131836
12866/28840	A customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded Dantès was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left	65.92486572265625
12867/28840	Dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear	66.4737319946289
12868/28840	He had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher Pain thou art not an	143.09722900390625

12871/28840	Jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted	75.67425537109375
12872/28840	Fortunately as we have said Edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women the wound soon	85.1351547241211
12873/28840	Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prizemoney but Jacopo refused it indign	36.17986297607422
12874/28840	As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of	50.885066986083984
12875/28840	But this sufficed for Jacopo who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which Edmond had concealed from all	41.30290985107422
12876/28840	And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave se	68.28291320800781

12878/28840	And when Jacopo inquired of him What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me Edmond replied Who knows You may one day be the captain of a	63.37913131713867

12880/28840	He had passed and repassed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing	57.258819580078125
12881/28840	Then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied	42.73685073852539
12882/28840	But in this world we must risk	57.732261657714844
12883/28840	Prison had made Edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk	96.9904556274414
12884/28840	But in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companions	46.523441314697266
12885/28840	This time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets stuffs of the Levant and cashme	58.419254302978516
12886/28840	It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of	59.37788772583008

12888/28840	At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca	39.52830505371094
12889/28840	When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following	34.4236946105957
12890/28840	Edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done	116.57228088378906
12891/28840	Nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following	77.25172424316406

12893/28840	The night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through Dantès	80.14321899414062
12894/28840	If he closed his eyes he saw Cardinal Spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his	71.22870635986328

12898/28840	All was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it	58.664093017578125
12899/28840	The day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his	42.42528533935547
12900/28840	Night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal Dantès	86.68681335449219
12901/28840	He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and	81.82852935791016
12902/28840	The old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and	67.90364074707031

12931/28840	What are there no grottos at Monte Cristo he	37.12289810180664
12932/28840	For a moment Dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by Cardinal Sp	34.112335205078125
12933/28840	The point was then to discover the hidden	280.13616943359375
12934/28840	It was useless to search at night and Dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the	44.96420669555664

12936/28840	The boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cables length of	181.931884765625
12937/28840	Fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transit	76.37097930908203
12938/28840	However Jacopo insisted on following him and Dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur	35.336002349853516
12939/28840	Scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a	62.56966018676758
12940/28840	This and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano was the bill of	78.34332275390625
12941/28840	Dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about	57.08243942260742
12942/28840	Having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom Jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital	47.25282287597656
12943/28840	Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his	30.940662384033203
12944/28840	At this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contempt	123.83631896972656
12945/28840	Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that I shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost	121.50968170166016
12946/28840	Oh no exclaimed Edmond that will not	90.69498443603516
12947/28840	The wise unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one	77.4398193359375
12948/28840	Besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched	101.02152252197266
12949/28840	Thus Dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for	86.68531799316406
12950/28840	The cause was not in Dantès but in Providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless	60.09658432006836
12951/28840	Meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have	55.55145263671875
12952/28840	Keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of	108.22425842285156
12953/28840	Time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite	73.23433685302734
12954/28840	Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lic	92.19815826416016
12955/28840	So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks	91.10489654541016
12956/28840	The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest	312.3187255859375
12957/28840	Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so	56.13192367553711
12958/28840	This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying	57.908329010009766
12959/28840	A large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to	74.21730041503906
12960/28840	Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his	50.30233383178711
12961/28840	Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the	100.91401672363281
12962/28840	Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed	26.180543899536133
12963/28840	The sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards	151.14447021484375
12964/28840	But even while they watched his daring progress Edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and	56.9666862487793
12965/28840	They all rushed towards him for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority yet Jacopo reached him	81.95645141601562
12966/28840	He found Edmond lying prone bleeding and almost	127.99981689453125
12967/28840	He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen	44.349021911621094
12968/28840	They poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as	72.21844482421875

12971/28840	It may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their	46.29426956176758
12972/28840	As for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be	52.572994232177734
12973/28840	The sailors did not require much	202.32310485839844
12974/28840	They were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremon	55.062225341796875
12975/28840	All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a mossgrown	36.26092529296875
12976/28840	But instead of growing easier Dantès pains appeared to increase in	96.98333740234375
12977/28840	The old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France between Nice and Fréjus urged Dantès to try and	43.557594299316406
12978/28840	Edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning	76.32452392578125
12979/28840	He has broken his ribs said the commander in a low	42.55214309692383
12980/28840	No matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave	29.664966583251953
12981/28840	We will try and carry him on board the tart	28.77490234375
12982/28840	Dantès declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost	37.44366455078125
12983/28840	Well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like	73.8843994140625
12984/28840	This very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed	221.43421936035156
12985/28840	The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its	48.10811996459961
12986/28840	Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his	27.431774139404297
12987/28840	No no he said to the patron I was awkward and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clums	59.6453742980957
12988/28840	Leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for	97.71807861328125

12990/28840	I would rather do so was Edmonds reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes	51.394325256347656
12991/28840	The patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be	130.75936889648438
12992/28840	What are we to do Maltese asked the	34.17426681518555
12993/28840	We cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot	114.5193862915039
12994/28840	We shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up	42.887943267822266
12995/28840	Why said Dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishingboat desire them to come here to	26.18637466430664
12996/28840	I will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to Legh	33.013999938964844

12998/28840	Listen Captain Baldi theres one way of settling this said Jacop	66.67500305175781
12999/28840	Do you go and I will stay and take care of the wounded	32.387882232666016
13000/28840	And give up your share of the venture said Edmond to remain with me   Yes said Jacopo and without any	35.46327590942383
13001/28840	You are a good fellow and a kindhearted messmate replied Edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but I do not wish anyone to stay with	35.01003646850586
13002/28840	A day or two of rest will set me up and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for	144.04876708984375
13003/28840	A peculiar smile passed over Dantès lips he squeezed Jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain	74.49058532714844
13004/28840	The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which Edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his	53.2805290222168
13005/28840	Then when they had disappeared he said with a smileTis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and	46.970027923583984
13006/28840	At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he	37.03915786743164
13007/28840	Then Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted	35.68147659301758
13008/28840	The Secret Cave   The sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the	48.32859420776367
13009/28840	Thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the	58.85897445678711
13010/28840	At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to cr	34.10328674316406
13011/28840	In a word the island was inhabited yet Edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of	55.1243782043457
13012/28840	He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and	61.0569953918457
13013/28840	This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every	43.03484344482422
13014/28840	It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that Edmond fixed his	35.08665466308594
13015/28840	The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the Island of Cors	83.24163818359375
13016/28840	He then looked at the objects near	164.21119689941406
13017/28840	He saw that he was on the highest point of the islanda statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of	43.78982925415039
13018/28840	Then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in	62.35821533203125
13019/28840	Dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient n	33.317657470703125
13020/28840	This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from	82.0684585571289
13021/28840	It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the circular	44.63502502441406
13022/28840	One thing only perplexed Edmond and destroyed his	297.1734313964844
13023/28840	How could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men   Suddenly an idea flashed across his	63.16672897338867
13024/28840	Instead of raising it thought he they have lowered	313.7403259277344
13025/28840	And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly	60.49501419067383
13026/28840	He soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now	87.00882720947266
13027/28840	0301m       Dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious art	30.86365509033203
13028/28840	He attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pick	61.29728317260742
13029/28840	After ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was	96.25678253173828
13030/28840	Dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a	36.92054748535156
13031/28840	But the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he Hercules	142.283203125
13032/28840	Dantès saw that he must attack the	27.85725975036621
13033/28840	But how   He cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left	24.81955909729004
13034/28840	He smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this	93.65474700927734
13035/28840	With the aid of his pickaxe Dantès after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpet	39.18888473510742
13036/28840	Dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the	46.49605178833008
13037/28840	The intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the	64.6265869140625
13038/28840	The rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its	79.73995971679688
13039/28840	Dantès redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient Titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the	29.1571044921875
13040/28840	The rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the	170.78952026367188
13041/28840	On the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag	89.0626220703125
13042/28840	Dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect	25.018239974975586
13043/28840	He would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to	36.26596450805664
13044/28840	This feeling lasted but for a	148.9764862060547
13045/28840	Edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous gro	44.50505447387695
13046/28840	Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of	100.340087890625
13047/28840	Come said he to himself be a	23.248064041137695
13048/28840	I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been	31.600860595703125
13049/28840	What then would be the use of all I have suffered The heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions	79.93399810791016
13050/28840	He remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his	25.353452682495117
13051/28840	Now that I expect nothing now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of	64.66114044189453
13052/28840	And he remained again motionless and	52.23131561279297
13053/28840	Yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal band	95.23316955566406
13054/28840	This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvel	129.2769012451172
13055/28840	0303m       But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked Dantès of	18.178449630737305
13056/28840	The fate replied he smiling of those who buried Alaric and were interred with the	177.6882781982422
13057/28840	Yet had he come thought Dantès he would have found the treasure and Borgia he who compared Italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this	55.89714431762695
13058/28840	Alas said Edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious	66.99097442626953
13059/28840	But he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by	86.9230728149414
13060/28840	In the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals	40.96830749511719
13061/28840	He had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the	56.49418640136719
13062/28840	He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions	77.66036224365234
13063/28840	The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès forehead large drops of pers	23.673904418945312
13064/28840	At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must	59.119468688964844
13065/28840	He again struck it and with greater	148.4628448486328
13066/28840	As he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white	48.78699493408203
13067/28840	The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate	148.00990295410156

13069/28840	But by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that Faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over	53.249969482421875
13070/28840	The island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue	32.656944274902344
13071/28840	Dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the	29.67034149169922
13072/28840	The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the	64.23297119140625
13073/28840	He had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by	39.43809127807617

13076/28840	The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer	50.08213424682617
13077/28840	He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went	81.92503356933594
13078/28840	At the left of the opening was a dark and deep	120.50363159179688

13082/28840	The time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and Dantès fate would be	85.38518524169922
13083/28840	He advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pick	76.23253631591797
13084/28840	At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron	122.19816589355469

13087/28840	He again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same	60.162471771240234

13089/28840	At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening Dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the	28.988950729370117

13098/28840	In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals	70.32099151611328
13099/28840	Dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was	19.476274490356445

13116/28840	With the first light Dantès resumed his	43.66012191772461
13117/28840	This done he impatiently awaited the return of his	122.71131134033203
13118/28840	On the sixth day the smugglers	252.94960021972656
13119/28840	He then inquired how they had fared in their	139.52487182617188
13120/28840	To this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guardship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards	70.41893768310547
13121/28840	This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of Dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so	45.539329528808594

13124/28840	Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per	55.073143005371094
13125/28840	The superior education of Dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its	51.90631866455078
13126/28840	The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles with directions from Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Crist	23.023956298828125

13131/28840	But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the	73.83903503417969
13132/28840	The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable	80.33670806884766
13133/28840	Some insisted she was making for Corsica others the Island of Elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of Monte Crist	84.52247619628906
13134/28840	Yet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a firstclass sailor and had come the distance from Genoa in thirtyfive	48.559730529785156
13135/28840	Dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little	34.916358947753906
13136/28840	The island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left	65.162841796875
13137/28840	Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret	40.326663970947266
13138/28840	The former Dantès proposed to augment the latter to	58.89693069458008
13139/28840	Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Crist	70.2926254272461
13140/28840	As it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacop	43.84800720214844
13141/28840	His signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the	86.6884994506836
13142/28840	A mournful answer awaited each of Edmonds eager inquiries as to the information Jacopo had	118.47241973876953

13148/28840	Without divulging his secret Dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an	68.74889373779297
13149/28840	There were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to	58.97494125366211
13150/28840	His lookingglass had assured him during his stay at Leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought	65.8803939819336
13151/28840	The first person to attract the attention of Dantès as he landed on the Canebière was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon	13.583989143371582
13152/28840	Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own	54.78983688354492
13153/28840	Going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then convers	47.60777282714844
13154/28840	Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility Dantès proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to	33.34263610839844

13157/28840	So extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank Edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless aston	72.61004638671875
13158/28840	Some nabob from India was his	395.94451904296875
13159/28840	Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished	121.68606567382812
13160/28840	And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was	17.629318237304688
13161/28840	Recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had	23.853530883789062
13162/28840	The nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the	37.86671829223633
13163/28840	Leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little	83.84651947021484
13164/28840	Then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be	33.21137619018555
13165/28840	The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them Dantès sighed	57.20262908935547
13166/28840	0317m       When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to	39.494361877441406
13167/28840	The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of Dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds	36.87046813964844
13168/28840	that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present	81.85147094726562

13184/28840	The horse was of Hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy	79.98314666748047

13188/28840	At this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to	56.207271575927734
13189/28840	At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to	41.408626556396484

13193/28840	Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain Caderousse hastily exclaimed A thousand pardons I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor	59.82984161376953
13194/28840	What would the abbé please to have What refreshment can I offer All I have is at his	103.37339782714844

13199/28840	But talking of heat is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment   Yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left	54.13619613647461

13215/28840	There was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the inn	23.049165725708008
13216/28840	You knew the poor lad then continued Cader	85.13483428955078
13217/28840	I was called to see him on his dying bed that I might administer to him the consolations of	51.22466278076172
13218/28840	And of what did he die asked Caderousse in a choking	19.99661636352539
13219/28840	Of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his	43.90293884277344
13220/28840	How should he have been otherwise Ah sir the poor fellow told you the	72.50732421875
13221/28840	And for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on	53.60563278198242
13222/28840	And here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Cader	23.699453353881836
13223/28840	Then I suppose asked Caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value   Why everything is relative answered the abb	35.58229446411133
13224/28840	To one in Edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great	82.2864761352539
13225/28840	It was estimated at fifty thousand franc	82.17719268798828
13226/28840	Bless me exclaimed Caderousse fifty thousand francs Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all	56.023841857910156
13227/28840	No replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for	24.794694900512695
13228/28840	The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the	39.58497619628906
13229/28840	Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable work	36.7281608581543
13230/28840	But how comes the diamond in your possession sir Did Edmond make you his heir   No merely his testamentary execut	65.85960388183594
13231/28840	I once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed he said and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my	80.50041198730469
13232/28840	The name of one of the four friends is Cader	33.21692657470703
13233/28840	Another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse is called Danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for	23.15184211730957
13234/28840	A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbés speech when the latter waving his hand said Allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so	34.796817779541016
13235/28840	The third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was Fernand that of my betrothed wasStay stay continued the abbé I have forgotten what he called	44.391971588134766
13236/28840	True said the abbé with a stifled sigh Mercédès it	6.262602806091309
13237/28840	Bring me a _carafe_ of water said the abb	22.29511260986328
13238/28840	You will go to Marseilles said Dantèsfor you understand I repeat his words just as he uttered	36.2010612487793
13239/28840	You will sell this diamond you will divide the money into five equal parts and give an equal portion to these good friends the only persons who have loved me upon	87.51251220703125
13240/28840	But why into five parts asked Caderousse you only mentioned four	186.2309112548828
13241/28840	Because the fifth is dead as I	273.59375
13242/28840	The fifth sharer in Edmonds bequest was his own	184.04837036132812
13243/28840	Too true too true ejaculated Caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did	34.96416473388672
13244/28840	I learned so much at Marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dantès I was unable to obtain any particulars of his	21.385353088378906
13245/28840	Can you enlighten me on that point   I do not know who could if I could not said Cader	30.197235107421875
13246/28840	Why I lived almost on the same floor with the poor old	56.86149978637695
13247/28840	Ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man	52.30485534667969
13248/28840	Of what did he die   Why the doctors called his complaint gastroenteritis I believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but I who saw him in his dying moments I say he died of   Caderousse	38.54141616821289
13249/28840	Of what asked the priest anxiously and	98.6655502319336
13250/28840	Starvation exclaimed the abbé springing from his	26.2542667388916
13251/28840	Why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as	68.06968688964844
13252/28840	Oh it is impossibleutterly impossible   What I have said I have said answered Cader	22.685680389404297
13253/28840	And you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the	34.68474578857422
13254/28840	Mind your own business wife replied Caderousse	129.12744140625
13255/28840	This gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to	86.33081817626953
13256/28840	What have you to do with politeness I should like to know Better study a little common prud	69.35083770751953
13257/28840	Ah thats all very fine retorted the	99.02644348144531
13258/28840	Nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy I beg of	117.62339782714844
13259/28840	Whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that I solemnly promise	52.59735107421875
13260/28840	La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they	55.35506820678711
13261/28840	Again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower	35.4837760925293
13262/28840	When he had sufficiently recovered himself he said It appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by	61.70818328857422
13263/28840	Surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a	74.06853485107422
13264/28840	And was he not so asked the abb	19.15215492248535
13265/28840	Poor Edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his	32.36299514770508
13266/28840	And whatever people may say continued Caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry I cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the	39.325767517089844
13267/28840	Do you then know in what manner Fernand injured Dantès inquired the abbé of Cader	14.984315872192383
13268/28840	Speak out then say what it was   Gaspard cried La Carconte do as you will you are masterbut if you take my advice youll hold your	59.9156608581543
13269/28840	Well wife replied Caderousse I dont know but what youre right   So you will say nothing asked the abb	26.18023109436035
13270/28840	Why what good would it do asked Cader	69.10636138916016
13271/28840	If the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps I should not	110.16499328613281
13272/28840	But you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with	89.76954650878906
13273/28840	You prefer then said the abbé that I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship   That is true enough returned Cader	55.09896469116211
13274/28840	You say truly the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars besides what would it be to them no more than a drop of water in the	42.565975189208984
13275/28840	Remember chimed in La Carconte those two could crush you at a single blow   How so inquired the abb	35.21061706542969
13276/28840	Are these persons then so rich and powerful   Do you not know their history   I do	23.98863410949707
13277/28840	Pray relate it to me   Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said No truly it would take up too much	49.90019226074219
13278/28840	I shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can and fulfil my promise to the dying	27.20446014404297
13279/28840	My first business will be to dispose of this	135.4668731689453
13280/28840	So saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Cader	24.086414337158203
13281/28840	It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès to be sold and the money divided between his father Mercédès his betrothed bride Fernand Danglars and	26.56427574157715
13282/28840	The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand franc	27.466060638427734
13283/28840	Oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished	99.92555236816406
13284/28840	The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked Cader	68.25130462646484
13285/28840	It does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four	35.277286529541016
13286/28840	And why among us four inquired Cader	93.817626953125
13287/28840	As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to	139.8517303466797
13288/28840	I dont call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering	64.4927978515625
13289/28840	Of course not rejoined Caderousse quickly no more do I and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just	95.34739685058594
13290/28840	I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps	76.6119613647461
13291/28840	Remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that I do	38.55591583251953
13292/28840	You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars in order that I may execute Edmonds last	44.11109924316406
13293/28840	The agitation of Caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated	34.526695251464844
13294/28840	As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep	22.907028198242188
13295/28840	For my part I wash my hands of the	140.845458984375
13296/28840	So saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the	34.725181579589844
13297/28840	Arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband Gaspard consider well what you are about to do   I have both reflected and decided answered	57.36893081665039
13298/28840	La Carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though	44.18251419067383
13299/28840	Well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do   To tell you all I know was the	20.038978576660156
13300/28840	I certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the	130.3037567138672
13301/28840	Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is	40.58926773071289
13302/28840	I hope it may be so replied Caderousse his face flushed with cup	24.041412353515625
13303/28840	I am all attention said the abb	15.432019233703613
13304/28840	Stop a minute answered Caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to	63.368431091308594
13305/28840	With these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at	43.508853912353516
13306/28840	During this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his	31.133291244506836
13307/28840	Remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of La Carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting	35.99821472167969
13308/28840	Enough enough replied Caderousse say no more about it I will take all the consequences upon	48.63188934326172
13309/28840	The Story   First sir said Caderousse you must make me a	27.2984619140625
13310/28840	Make yourself easy my friend replied the abb	17.080827713012695
13311/28840	I am a priest and confessions die in my	54.46963882446289
13312/28840	Recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our	75.11711120605469
13313/28840	This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little	165.69503784179688
13314/28840	Well then under these circumstances said Caderousse I will I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestion	46.5932502746582
13315/28840	Begin with his father if you	64.32562255859375
13316/28840	said the abbé Edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest	31.074321746826172
13317/28840	The history is a sad one sir said Caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it  	26.569019317626953
13318/28840	answered the abbé Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marse	24.538766860961914
13319/28840	At La Réserve Oh yes I can see it all before me this	53.85319900512695
13320/28840	Was it not his betrothal feast   It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and Dantès was	36.63800811767578
13321/28840	Yes and up to this point I know all said the	61.88247299194336
13322/28840	Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you or heard mention of anyone of	79.14473724365234
13323/28840	Well when Dantès was arrested Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very	28.132648468017578
13324/28840	The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of	21.55649757385254
13325/28840	But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb	25.180850982666016
13326/28840	Ah sir replied Caderousse we cannot console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides I know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing	42.35757827758789
13327/28840	One night however I heard his sobs and I could not resist my desire to go up to him but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but	41.26958084106445
13328/28840	From day to day he lived on alone and more and more	141.88963317871094
13329/28840	Morrel and Mercédès came to see him but his door was closed and although I was certain he was at home he would not make any	19.361173629760742
13330/28840	At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to	91.92326354980469
13331/28840	I know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left	51.407352447509766
13332/28840	For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth I heard	82.48274230957031
13333/28840	I then resolved to go up to him at all	28.559797286987305
13334/28840	The door was closed but I looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill I went and told	54.49066925048828
13335/28840	Morrel and then ran on to Mercédè	14.848638534545898
13336/28840	Morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited	81.33785247802734
13337/28840	I was there too and I never shall forget the old mans smile at this	82.4798355102539
13338/28840	From that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a	94.48259735107422
13339/28840	The abbé uttered a kind of gro	20.31658172607422
13340/28840	The story interests you does it not sir inquired Cader	65.63804626464844
13341/28840	Yes replied the abbé it is very	11.643739700317383
13342/28840	Mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own	29.386751174926758
13343/28840	Morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually	49.86161422729492
13344/28840	Mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and	29.076251983642578
13345/28840	The abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched	45.38795852661133
13346/28840	And you believe he died   Of hunger sir of hunger said Cader	34.35973358154297
13347/28840	I am as certain of it as that we two are	79.30615997314453
13348/28840	The abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him halffull swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale	43.586368560791016
13349/28840	This was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse	26.475337982177734
13350/28840	The more so sir as it was mens and not Gods	181.8763885498047
13351/28840	Tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me	33.725807189941406
13352/28840	Tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine   Two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionFernand and Dangl	61.39299392700195
13353/28840	How was this jealousy manifested Speak	487.2825927734375
13354/28840	They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist	42.99886703491211
13355/28840	Which of the two denounced him Which was the real delinquent   Both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the	51.678627014160156
13356/28840	And where was this letter written   At La Réserve the day before the betrothal	21.78122329711914
13357/28840	Twas so thentwas so then murmured the abb	161.50453186035156
13358/28840	Oh Faria Faria how well did you judge men and things   What did you please to say sir asked Cader	40.911842346191406
13359/28840	Nothing nothing replied the priest go	126.45182800292969
13360/28840	It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and Fernand who put it in the	30.007892608642578

13362/28840	I said Caderousse astonished who told you I was there   The abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quicklyNo one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an	35.028018951416016
13363/28840	True true said Caderousse in a choking voice I was	26.39237403869629
13364/28840	And did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbé if not you were an accompl	31.343698501586914
13365/28840	Sir replied Caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that I nearly lost all	49.00193405151367
13366/28840	I had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around	70.79528045654297
13367/28840	I said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly	48.42573165893555

13369/28840	Yes sir I was there and very anxious to speak but Danglars restrained	30.8155517578125

13373/28840	Yes sir answered Caderousse and remorse preys on me night and	112.89444732666016
13374/28840	I often ask pardon of God I swear to you because this action the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject	37.5395393371582
13375/28840	I am expiating a moment of selfishness and so I always say to La Carconte when she complains Hold your tongue woman it is the will of	34.49176788330078
13376/28840	And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real	55.68588638305664
13377/28840	Well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve	39.32827377319336
13378/28840	Unfortunately Edmond is dead and has not pardoned	54.70619583129883
13379/28840	He did not know said the abb	13.985882759094238
13380/28840	But he knows it all now interrupted Caderousse they say the dead know	144.87440490722656
13381/28840	There was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his	21.648794174194336
13382/28840	You have two or three times mentioned a	106.38175964355469

13389/28840	In that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of God rich	61.52000427246094
13390/28840	He is reduced almost to the last extremitynay he is almost at the point of dishon	50.13143539428711
13391/28840	How   Yes continued Caderousse so it is after fiveandtwenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles	26.6595401763916
13392/28840	If this ship founders like the others he is a ruined	47.80504608154297

13395/28840	And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added Cader	66.81258392333984
13396/28840	How is that   Because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to	69.2957992553711
13397/28840	What has become of Danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty   What has become of him Why he left Marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of	26.477907180786133

13400/28840	Ah said the abbé in a peculiar tone he is	17.970863342285156
13401/28840	Happy Who can answer for that Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to ones self and the wallswalls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness Danglars is	71.58271026611328
13402/28840	And Fernand   Fernand Why much the same	141.21041870117188
13403/28840	But how could a poor Catalan fisherboy without education or resources make a fortune I confess this staggers	99.76986694335938
13404/28840	There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one	68.58890533447266

13418/28840	The French government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer	122.08133697509766
13419/28840	Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece still having his name kept on the army	240.56797790527344

13421/28840	Ali Pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to France when he was gazetted lieutenant	68.47541809082031
13422/28840	So that now continued Caderousse he owns a magnificent house	65.90436553955078
13423/28840	Has she made a fortune also inquired the abbé with an ironical	36.59358215332031
13424/28840	Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris replied Cader	11.788505554199219
13425/28840	Go on said the abbé it seems as if I were listening to the story of a	26.19845962524414
13426/28840	But I have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise	75.33143615722656
13427/28840	Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Ed	20.200180053710938
13428/28840	I have told you of her attempts to propitiate	33.43771743774414
13429/28840	de Villefort her devotion to the elder Dantè	23.199626922607422
13430/28840	In the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook	63.987735748291016
13431/28840	This was the departure of Fernandof Fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her	47.93490219116211
13432/28840	Three months passed and still she weptno news of Edmond no news of Fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with	84.40382385253906
13433/28840	One evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans she returned to her home more depressed than	48.083740234375
13434/28840	Suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and Fernand dressed in the uniform of a sublieutenant stood before	52.35410690307617
13435/28840	It was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to	38.65760040283203
13436/28840	Mercédès seized Fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary	47.32097244262695
13437/28840	And then it must be confessed Fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely	169.5253143310547

13440/28840	Fernand saw this and when he learned of the old mans death he	48.94847869873047
13441/28840	At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès at the second he reminded her that he loved	40.73783874511719
13442/28840	Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Ed	66.9274673461914
13443/28840	So that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in	13.53741455078125
13444/28840	What more could the most devoted lover desire Then he murmured the words of the English poet Frailty thy name is	61.60413360595703
13445/28840	Six months afterwards continued Caderousse the marriage took place in the church of Accou	60.84190368652344

13448/28840	There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans and eight days after the wedding they left Marse	61.071266174316406
13449/28840	Did you ever see Mercédès again inquired the	24.41236114501953
13450/28840	Yes during the Spanish war at Perpignan where Fernand had left her she was attending to the education of her	79.94291687011719
13451/28840	But then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education	52.46107864379883
13452/28840	I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but un	60.19205856323242
13453/28840	Oh replied Caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed Mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most	34.73100280761719
13454/28840	Fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing	370.10791015625
13455/28840	Besides I believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her	46.23550796508789
13456/28840	But now her position in life is assured continued Caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet   Caderousse	72.98936462402344
13457/28840	Yet I am sure she is not happy said Cader	15.157866477966309
13458/28840	What makes you believe this   Why when I found myself utterly destitute I thought my old friends would perhaps assist	44.447166442871094
13459/28840	So I went to Danglars who would not even receive	29.304067611694336
13460/28840	I called on Fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valetdechamb	15.767709732055664
13461/28840	Then you did not see either of them   No but Madame de Morcerf saw	21.504093170166016
13462/28840	How was that   As I went away a purse fell at my feetit contained fiveandtwenty louis I raised my head quickly and saw Mercédès who at once shut the	27.98093032836914
13463/28840	Oh he never was a friend of mine I did not know him and I had nothing to ask of	15.212995529174805

13468/28840	I know what happiness and what despair are and I never make a jest of such	75.96246337890625
13469/28840	Take it then but in exchange   Caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his	38.53032302856445

13472/28840	Caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been g	48.63332748413086
13473/28840	The abbé took it and in return gave Caderousse the	32.761417388916016
13474/28840	Oh you are a man of God sir cried Caderousse for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept	23.925678253173828
13475/28840	Which said the abbé to himself you would have	15.486335754394531
13476/28840	The abbé rose took his hat and	19.470985412597656

13479/28840	Tis well and may this money profit you Adieu I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each	105.8262939453125
13480/28840	When Caderousse turned around he saw behind him La Carconte paler and trembling more than	31.388622283935547
13481/28840	Is then all that I have heard really true she	104.2711410522461

13495/28840	Ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of	91.83888244628906

13500/28840	The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards the street	64.42705535888672

13503/28840	The Englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of Marse	36.02922821044922
13504/28840	de Boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in	79.65034484863281
13505/28840	But said the Englishman this looks very much like a suspension of	44.711212158203125
13506/28840	It looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed	366.5604248046875
13507/28840	The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said From which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension   To tell you the truth I consider it	50.11942672729492
13508/28840	Well then I will buy it of you   You   Yes I   But at a tremendous discount of course   No for two hundred thousand franc	24.27089500427246

13513/28840	de Bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at selfcontrol and said   Sir I ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this	28.05727195739746
13514/28840	Thats no affair of mine replied the Englishman that is the affair of the house of Thomson  French in whose name I	32.26496505737305
13515/28840	They have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival	155.30450439453125
13516/28840	But all I know sir is that I am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the	70.62167358398438
13517/28840	Of course that is perfectly just cried	607.7335815429688
13518/28840	The commission is usually one and a half will you have twothreefive per cent or even more Whatever you	77.21136474609375
13519/28840	Sir replied the Englishman laughing I am like my house and do not do such thingsno the commission I ask is quite	52.56453323364258
13520/28840	You are the inspector of prisons   I have been so these fourteen	21.406970977783203
13521/28840	You keep the registers of entries and departures   I	109.41108703613281
13522/28840	To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners   There are special reports on every	118.30779266357422
13523/28840	Well sir I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared	68.2427749633789
13524/28840	I have since learned that he was confined in the Château dIf and I should like to learn some particulars of his	14.85267448425293
13525/28840	What was his name   The Abbé Far	9.428285598754883
13526/28840	Oh I recollect him perfectly cried	134.55316162109375
13527/28840	Very possibly but what sort of madness was it   He pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate	53.75173568725586
13528/28840	Poor deviland he is dead   Yes sir five or six months ago last	76.18511199951172
13529/28840	You have a good memory sir to recollect dates so	72.08087158203125
13530/28840	I recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular	52.482460021972656
13531/28840	May I ask what that was said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic count	29.37889862060547
13532/28840	de Boville I myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of	67.5005874633789
13533/28840	That man made a deep impression on me I shall never forget his countenance   20025m       The Englishman smiled impercept	12.84031867980957
13534/28840	And you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons   Were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this Edmond Dantès   This dangerous mans name was   Edmond Dantè	24.51793670654297
13535/28840	It appears sir that this Edmond Dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one	54.784481048583984
13536/28840	This tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape   No doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the Abbé Faria had an attack of catalepsy and	41.06554412841797
13537/28840	That must have cut short the projects of	220.25445556640625
13538/28840	For the dead man yes replied	219.03775024414062
13539/28840	de Boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his	32.861812591552734
13540/28840	It was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the English	111.3295669555664
13541/28840	As I have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his	32.81781005859375
13542/28840	How was that   How Do you not comprehend  	41.61446762084961
13543/28840	The Château dIf has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirtysixpound cannonball to their	32.8184814453125
13544/28840	Well observed the Englishman as if he were slow of	54.775001525878906
13545/28840	Well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the	19.77598762512207
13546/28840	Yes sir continued the inspector of	25.104711532592773
13547/28840	You may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks I should like to have seen his face at that	33.04677200317383
13548/28840	No matter replied De Boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francsno matter I can fancy	56.506011962890625
13549/28840	So can I said the Englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the English do at the end of his	62.76551055908203
13550/28840	And so continued the Englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned   Unquestion	49.72399139404297
13551/28840	So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time   Precise	31.561857223510742
13552/28840	20027m       But some official document was drawn up as to this affair I suppose inquired the English	38.62665557861328
13553/28840	You understand Dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or	32.15401840209961
13554/28840	So that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy	79.94078826904297
13555/28840	He is dead and no mistake about	60.8157958984375
13556/28840	Oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they	96.20589447021484
13557/28840	True this story has diverted our attention from	148.58558654785156
13558/28840	Excuse you for what For the story By no means it really seems to me very	100.20511627197266
13559/28840	So sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness	33.17149353027344
13560/28840	Go into my study here and I will show it to	32.5567741394043
13561/28840	Everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its	279.47442626953125
13562/28840	There he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination Morrels petition	60.57586669921875
13563/28840	Then he saw through the whole	95.46199798583984
13564/28840	This petition to Napoleon kept back by Villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the kings	68.40538024902344
13565/28840	He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name   Edmond Dantè	53.78532409667969
13566/28840	An inveterate Bonapartist took an active part in the return from the Island of El	22.567060470581055
13567/28840	To be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and	156.5820770263672
13568/28840	Beneath these lines was written in another hand See note abovenothing can be	327.44305419921875
13569/28840	He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say was in Villeforts	58.960601806640625
13570/28840	As we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the Abbé Farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading _Le Drapeau Blanc	29.169797897338867
13571/28840	He did not see the Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by Danglars under the arbor of La Réserve and which had the postmark Marseilles 27th February delivery 6 oclock	26.77834129333496
13572/28840	But it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do however irregular it might	33.54033279418945
13573/28840	Thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam I have all I want now it is for me to perform my	44.322265625
13574/28840	Give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and I will hand you over the	86.92605590820312
13575/28840	He rose gave his seat to	136.5413360595703
13576/28840	de Boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the Englishman counted out the banknotes on the other side of the	49.45451736450195
13577/28840	The House of Morrel  Son   Anyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of Morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great	24.39516830444336
13578/28840	Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two	57.61546325683594
13579/28840	One was a young man of three or fourandtwenty who was in love with	16.226898193359375

13581/28840	He was however the same Cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against	86.27501678466797
13582/28840	Morrel and strong in the multiplicationtable which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch	111.14068603515625

13584/28840	But this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm	74.38005828857422
13585/28840	Like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the	89.90812683105469
13586/28840	Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their	109.27099609375
13587/28840	Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude Cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to	69.97840118408203
13588/28840	Morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying   Thanks Cocles you are the pearl of cash	30.941495895385742
13589/28840	Cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of	133.3077850341797
13590/28840	Morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crown	47.71318054199219
13591/28840	But since the end of the month	25.69443130493164
13592/28840	Morrel had passed many an anxious	180.5599822998047
13593/28840	By this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now	68.98319244384766
13594/28840	Credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to	29.27859878540039
13595/28840	Morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the _Pharaon_ of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in	25.784027099609375
13596/28840	But this vessel which like the _Pharaon_ came from Calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the _Pharaon	24.743453979492188
13597/28840	20033m       Such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with	21.2291259765625
13598/28840	de Boville the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French of Rome presented himself at	15.628387451171875
13599/28840	Emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the	59.46824645996094
13600/28840	The young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the newcomer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to	38.67118835449219
13601/28840	Emmanuel and that his business was with	75.61249542236328
13602/28840	Cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to	94.30049133300781
13603/28840	Cocles went first and the stranger followed	151.523681640625
13604/28840	On the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the	88.06011199951172
13605/28840	Morrel is in his room is he not Mademoiselle Julie said the cash	26.841154098510742
13606/28840	Yes I think so at least said the young girl hesitating	13.685131072998047
13607/28840	Go and see Cocles and if my father is there announce this	118.86693572998047
13608/28840	It will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the English	35.304954528808594
13609/28840	Morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French of Rome with whom your father does	26.24122428894043
13610/28840	The young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and Cocles continued to mount the	46.209808349609375
13611/28840	The Englishman entered and found Morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his	49.16581726074219
13612/28840	At the sight of the stranger	103.2452621459961
13613/28840	Morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own	46.93614196777344
13614/28840	The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with	17.871671676635742
13615/28840	The house of Thomson  French had 300000 or 400000 francs to pay this month in France and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money	53.619693756103516
13616/28840	Morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with pers	11.90109634399414
13617/28840	So then sir said Morrel you hold bills of mine   Yes and for a considerable	31.793926239013672
13618/28840	What is the amount asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render	49.28031921386719
13619/28840	20035m       Here is said the Englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of 200000 francs to our house by	18.1318302154541
13620/28840	de Boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are	47.95134353637695
13621/28840	You acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him   Yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years	57.23618698120117
13622/28840	When are you to pay   Half the 15th of this month half the 15th of	57.3326416015625
13623/28840	Just so and now here are 32500 francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the	49.11222839355469
13624/28840	I recognize them said Morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own	34.37744903564453
13625/28840	It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumer	42.045047760009766
13626/28840	Two hundred and eightyseven thousand five hundred francs repeated	65.90251922607422
13627/28840	I will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your	54.78200149536133
13628/28840	At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly	355.6627197265625
13629/28840	But as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality   Morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto	32.496795654296875
13630/28840	To questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be	495.1176452636719
13631/28840	Well said the other if this last resource fail you   Well returned Morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune I must habituate myself to	35.50774383544922
13632/28840	I fear I shall be forced to suspend	49.249820709228516
13633/28840	Have you no friends who could assist you   Morrel smiled mourn	54.8260612487793
13634/28840	In business sir said he one has no friends only correspond	92.44930267333984
13635/28840	It is true murmured the Englishman then you have but one	26.94012451171875
13636/28840	So that if this fail   I am ruinedcompletely ruined   As I was on my way here a vessel was coming into	39.98234176635742
13637/28840	And it is not yours   No she is a Bordeaux vessel _La Gironde_ she comes from India also but she is not	31.40143585205078
13638/28840	Perhaps she has spoken to the _Pharaon_ and brings you some tidings of her   Shall I tell you plainly one thing sir I dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in	36.06719207763672
13639/28840	Then in a low voice Morrel addedThis delay is not	35.35268020629883
13640/28840	The _Pharaon_ left Calcutta the 5th of February she ought to have been here a month	15.146212577819824
13641/28840	What is the meaning of that noise   Oh my God cried Morrel turning pale what is it   A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled so	30.168472290039062
13642/28840	Morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a	16.02811622619629

13644/28840	The noise had ceased but it seemed that Morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must	67.98512268066406
13645/28840	The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the	41.88328552246094
13646/28840	A key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was	42.174800872802734
13647/28840	There are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured Morrel Cocles and	52.40862274169922
13648/28840	At this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears	26.37845802307129
13649/28840	Morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the	26.65591812133789
13650/28840	He would have spoken but his voice failed	44.683021545410156

13652/28840	Oh father father murmured she courage   The _Pharaon_ has gone down then said Morrel in a hoarse	22.24871826171875
13653/28840	The young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fathers	23.929447174072266
13654/28840	Saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the	66.23184967041016
13655/28840	Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime	23.54907989501953
13656/28840	Thanks my God said he at least thou strikest but me	78.12825012207031
13657/28840	A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic English	32.85730743408203
13658/28840	Come in come in said Morrel for I presume you are all at the	47.676937103271484
13659/28840	Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping	74.0224609375

13661/28840	At the sight of these men the Englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the	35.60505294799805
13662/28840	Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder Emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrels family and the sailors at the	35.08753967285156
13663/28840	Draw nearer Penelon said the young man and tell us all about	23.79950714111328

13665/28840	Morrel said he as if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from Aix or Toul	14.56186294555664
13666/28840	Goodday Penelon returned Morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain   The captain	58.083580017089844

13669/28840	What do I think captain Why I think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didnt mean	65.1233901977539
13670/28840	Thats my opinion too said the captain and Ill take precautions	228.27284240722656

13680/28840	His firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone	224.6055450439453
13681/28840	Penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his	15.122286796569824
13682/28840	We did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our topsails and scudded under bare	62.020103454589844
13683/28840	The vessel was very old to risk that said the English	66.77535247802734
13684/28840	Eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a	111.85321807861328
13685/28840	Penelon said the captain I think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the	26.981943130493164

13688/28840	Ah said I after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but	120.52500915527344
13689/28840	Is that the example you set Penelon cries the captain very well wait a	183.50978088378906
13690/28840	He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of	37.454654693603516
13691/28840	I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said	35.84354782104492
13692/28840	Two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes	133.8910675048828
13693/28840	Come said the captain we have done all in our power and	19.40338706970215
13694/28840	Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save	57.8289680480957
13695/28840	To the boats my lads as quick as you	120.16909790039062
13696/28840	Morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say Get alongsave	56.82563781738281
13697/28840	We soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into	157.92811584472656
13698/28840	The captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so I took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then I jumped after	54.096004486083984
13699/28840	It was time for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a manof	76.74351501464844

13701/28840	Morrel thats the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there A general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and suffer	50.083805084228516
13702/28840	Morrel I know there was no one in fault but	60.67051315307617
13703/28840	It was the will of God that this should happen blessed be his	98.2432632446289
13704/28840	What wages are due to you   Oh dont let us talk of that	27.406383514404297
13705/28840	Yes but we will talk of	32.01896667480469
13706/28840	Cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said Mor	67.0918960571289
13707/28840	At another time added he I should have said Give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this	81.02249145507812
13708/28840	Penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with	16.224773406982422
13709/28840	Morrel said he again turning his quid as for that   As for what   The	54.1534309387207
13710/28840	Well   Well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the	25.75089454650879
13711/28840	Thanks my friends thanks cried Morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do	41.05881118774414
13712/28840	These last words produced a prodigious effect on the se	60.55409240722656
13713/28840	Penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he	75.64611053466797
13714/28840	Morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us   No no said	20.9205265045166
13715/28840	Morrel I am not angry quite the contrary and I do not send you away but I have no more ships and therefore I do not want any	31.628976821899414
13716/28840	No more ships returned Penelon well then youll build some well wait for	104.66822052001953
13717/28840	I have no money to build ships with Penelon said the poor owner mournfully so I cannot accept your kind	55.325355529785156
13718/28840	No more money Then you must not pay us we can scud like the _Pharaon_ under bare	86.88167572021484
13719/28840	Enough enough cried Morrel almost overpowered leave me I pray you we shall meet again in a happier	66.7458724975586
13720/28840	Emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are	37.869136810302734
13721/28840	At least we shall see each other again	86.12461853027344
13722/28840	He made a sign to Cocles who went first the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the	54.34074401855469
13723/28840	Now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me I wish to speak with this	24.47638702392578
13724/28840	20045m       And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson  French who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have	24.355073928833008
13725/28840	The two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment Julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern	46.20847702026367
13726/28840	Well sir said Morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and I have nothing further to tell	21.820865631103516
13727/28840	I see returned the Englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve	63.195587158203125
13728/28840	Let me see continued the stranger I am one of your largest	56.94525909423828
13729/28840	Your bills at least are the first that will fall	155.71612548828125
13730/28840	Do you wish for time to pay   A delay would save my honor and consequently my	70.23198699951172
13731/28840	How long a delay do you wish for   Morrel	58.63503646850586
13732/28840	I will give you three replied the	27.131221771240234
13733/28840	But asked Morrel will the house of Thomson  French consent   Oh I take everything on	46.761260986328125
13734/28840	Well renew these bills up to the 5th of September and on the 5th of September at eleven oclock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven I shall come to receive the	36.51898193359375
13735/28840	I shall expect you returned Morrel and I will pay youor I shall be	43.464622497558594
13736/28840	These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear	30.849273681640625
13737/28840	The bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor shipowner found himself with three months before him to collect his	76.3187026977539
13738/28840	The Englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and Morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the	38.40036392211914
13739/28840	The stranger met Julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for	61.64227294921875
13740/28840	Mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed Sinbad the	11.567277908325195
13741/28840	Do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may	120.11095428466797
13742/28840	Do you promise   I swear to you I	16.5623836517334
13743/28840	Continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you by giving you Emmanuel for a	63.812103271484375
13744/28840	Julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the bal	55.25130081176758
13745/28840	The stranger waved his hand and continued to	64.66499328613281
13746/28840	In the court he found Penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain	39.95538330078125
13747/28840	Come with me my friend said the Englishman I wish to speak to	10.788725852966309
13748/28840	The same day he told his wife Emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the	57.51807403564453
13749/28840	Unfortunately however Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson  French who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not	51.88973617553711
13750/28840	Unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all Morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary	147.7216033935547
13751/28840	The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman were paid by Cocles with equal punct	71.82402801513672
13752/28840	Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquill	188.2500457763672
13753/28840	It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50000 francs of	59.40909957885742
13754/28840	de Boville and on the 30th the 32500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined	38.56351852416992
13755/28840	The opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down Morrel it was impossible for him to remain	42.79827880859375
13756/28840	Great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punct	27.307172775268555
13757/28840	Still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the	43.13489532470703
13758/28840	The month passed and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his	110.69963836669922
13759/28840	Formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in	308.4703063964844
13760/28840	Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him	159.37037658691406
13761/28840	Fortunately Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July	65.00286102294922
13762/28840	The agent of Thomson  French had not been again seen at Marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to Morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and	36.381629943847656
13763/28840	Morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three	182.53469848632812
13764/28840	As to the sailors of the _Pharaon_ they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had	19.243675231933594
13765/28840	Captain Gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from Pal	141.12600708007812
13766/28840	He delayed presenting himself at Morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see	81.72885131835938
13767/28840	The worthy shipowner knew from Penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console	71.75511932373047
13768/28840	He brought him also the amount of his wages which Captain Gaumard had not dared to apply	37.96260070800781
13769/28840	As he descended the staircase Morrel met Penelon who was going	19.474018096923828
13770/28840	Penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly	54.768524169921875
13771/28840	Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new	32.542999267578125
13772/28840	But contrary to all expectation when the 31st of August came the house opened as usual and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual	96.333740234375
13773/28840	There came in moreover two drafts which	516.9564819335938
13774/28840	Morrel had fully anticipated and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had	55.11215591430664
13775/28840	All this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of	59.27333068847656
13776/28840	On the 1st Morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to Paris they hoped great	129.26593017578125
13777/28840	It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited	28.4520206451416
13778/28840	Danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save Morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and Morrel was	42.171443939208984
13779/28840	Morrel had long thought of Danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last	27.489009857177734
13780/28840	And Morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a	68.00350189208984
13781/28840	Yet on his arrival Morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh	69.98456573486328
13782/28840	He embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed Emmanuels hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Coc	51.70725631713867
13783/28840	Then said the two women to Emmanuel we are indeed	145.90399169921875
13784/28840	It was agreed in a brief council held among them that Julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at Nîmes to come to them as speedily as	45.1301383972168

13794/28840	They had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles Julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost constern	45.15208053588867
13795/28840	Morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the	137.41146850585938
13796/28840	All his funds amounted to 6000 or 8000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4000 or 5000 which making the best of everything gave him 14000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287500 franc	44.762855529785156
13797/28840	He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on	100.78085327148438
13798/28840	However when Morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very	73.91576385498047
13799/28840	This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have	54.42489242553711

13801/28840	As to Cocles he seemed completely bewild	63.36640548706055

13805/28840	Night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room Morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his	50.60134506225586

13808/28840	In the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was Julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her	64.07682800292969
13809/28840	The young lady went towards Madame Mor	41.73645782470703
13810/28840	They had understood each other without	221.96287536621094
13811/28840	Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole Morrel was writing but Madame Morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped	64.52278900146484
13812/28840	The terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a	45.44325256347656
13813/28840	Morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bos	36.775390625
13814/28840	In the evening Julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her fathers heart beat	48.868194580078125
13815/28840	The next two days passed in much the same	125.2864990234375
13816/28840	On the evening of the 4th of September	20.78368377685547
13817/28840	Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his	73.64107513427734
13818/28840	Julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad o	168.17173767089844
13819/28840	Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment The young girl looked at Mor	50.81854248046875
13820/28840	What have I done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me   Nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple questionnothing only I want	51.28034973144531
13821/28840	Julie made a pretence to feel for the	150.18301391601562
13822/28840	I must have left it in my room she	30.289936065673828
13823/28840	And she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult	28.77278709411621
13824/28840	Do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a	48.42478561401367
13825/28840	She questioned Emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he	100.79387664794922
13826/28840	During the night between the 4th and 5th of September Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oclock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great	37.79777908325195
13827/28840	It was three oclock when he threw himself on the	15.383612632751465
13828/28840	The mother and daughter passed the night	35.46555709838867
13829/28840	They had expected Maximilian since the previous	36.73193359375

13832/28840	They did not dare to ask him how he had	40.88749694824219

13836/28840	I wish you to do so said	12.843375205993652
13837/28840	This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and Julie did not dare to disob	36.913631439208984
13838/28840	She remained at the same spot standing mute and motion	34.24541473388672
13839/28840	An instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her	61.587921142578125
13840/28840	She looked up and uttered an exclamation of	24.035106658935547

13842/28840	At these words Madame Morrel rose and threw herself into her sons	24.378910064697266
13843/28840	Mother said the young man looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter what has occurredwhat has happened Your letter has frightened me and I have come hither with all	30.145435333251953
13844/28840	Julie said Madame Morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that Maximilian has just	18.23342514038086
13845/28840	The young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his	22.469562530517578
13846/28840	Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel inquired the man with a strong Italian	24.35381317138672
13847/28840	Yes sir replied Julie with hesitation what is your pleasure I do not know	24.046388626098633
13848/28840	Read this letter he said handing it to	79.86705780029297
13849/28840	It concerns the best interests of your father said the	52.876495361328125
13850/28840	The young girl hastily took the letter from	35.967350006103516
13851/28840	She opened it quickly and read   Go this moment to the Allées de Meilhan enter the house	26.41465950012207

13854/28840	The young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had	63.367557525634766
13855/28840	She cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a post	75.94149017333984
13856/28840	She read   It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and	82.46481323242188
13857/28840	If you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about	42.933937072753906
13858/28840	This postscript decreased greatly the young girls	236.6789093017578
13859/28840	Was there nothing to fear was there not some snare laid for her Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her	84.35425567626953
13860/28840	But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest	84.17705535888672
13861/28840	Julie hesitated and resolved to take	352.5172119140625
13862/28840	Yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to	93.9583740234375
13863/28840	She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson  French had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the	46.29149627685547
13864/28840	You must go then mademoiselle said	38.01737976074219
13865/28840	But did you not read that I must be alone said	84.67863464355469
13866/28840	And you shall be alone replied the young	22.27570152282715
13867/28840	Did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it   But what danger threatens him then Emmanuel she	133.38096618652344
13868/28840	Emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him	65.80238342285156
13869/28840	Listen he said today is the 5th of September is it not  	12.792034149169922
13870/28840	Today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay   Yes we know	24.7459659576416
13871/28840	Well then continued Emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the	25.601526260375977
13872/28840	What will happen then   Why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a	43.56834411621094
13873/28840	Oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young	85.86665344238281
13874/28840	During this time Madame Morrel had told her son	55.784542083740234
13875/28840	The young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a	34.47084426879883
13876/28840	Then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in	78.22039794921875
13877/28840	While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his	30.920522689819336
13878/28840	Instead of going direct to his study	61.15927505493164
13879/28840	Morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment	41.517120361328125
13880/28840	Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was	24.61189079284668
13881/28840	He remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his	43.30268478393555
13882/28840	Maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on Morrels	24.62165641784668
13883/28840	Father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat   Oh this is what I feared said Mor	21.510452270507812
13884/28840	Father father in Heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for   Maximilian replied Morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of	19.172760009765625
13885/28840	Come and I will explain to	7.668621063232422
13886/28840	And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study while Maximilian followed him trembling as he	20.616172790527344
13887/28840	Morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open	29.052682876586914
13888/28840	In this ledger was made out an exact balancesheet of his	83.13739013671875
13889/28840	Morrel had to pay within half an hour 287500 franc	26.801782608032227
13890/28840	The young man was overwhelmed as he	56.757877349853516
13891/28840	What could he say What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures   And have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moments	49.137691497802734
13892/28840	You have no money coming in on which you can rely  	81.49031066894531
13893/28840	You have exhausted every resource  	145.24087524414062
13894/28840	And in half an hour said Maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored   Blood washes out dishonor said Mor	35.408546447753906
13895/28840	You are right father I understand	148.0453338623047
13896/28840	Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said There is one for you and one for methanks   Morrel caught his	39.503849029541016
13897/28840	Your motheryour sister Who will support them   A shudder ran through the young mans	73.82714080810547
13898/28840	Father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live   Yes I do so bid you answered Morrel it is your	23.734437942504883

13901/28840	The young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his	25.62168312072754
13902/28840	Be it so then my father he said extending his hand to Morrel die in peace my father I will	56.859737396240234
13903/28840	Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but Maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a	27.20862579345703
13904/28840	You know it is not my fault said Mor	20.179834365844727

13908/28840	On seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on	67.27677917480469
13909/28840	To you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to	74.79725646972656

13915/28840	The young man uttered a groan but appeared	71.25220489501953
13916/28840	And now said Morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister	56.93806457519531
13917/28840	Will you not see my sister once more asked Maximil	58.4757194519043
13918/28840	A last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested	89.26368713378906
13919/28840	I saw her this morning and bade her ad	31.526464462280273
13920/28840	Have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired Maximilian in a faltering	47.70341873168945

13928/28840	The young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of	66.7249984741211
13929/28840	And he rushed out of the	38.691184997558594
13930/28840	When his son had left him Morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the	31.79340934753418
13931/28840	It was no longer the same manthe fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed	71.9002685546875

13935/28840	Cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated	28.08320426940918
13936/28840	Morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was	41.836952209472656
13937/28840	The hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its	147.14772033691406
13938/28840	What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in	83.24544525146484
13939/28840	He was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life	87.64739227294922
13940/28840	To form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to	43.580074310302734
13941/28840	The pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughters	145.17640686035156
13942/28840	Then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few	61.836517333984375
13943/28840	It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved	27.00942039489746
13944/28840	Then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by	245.38714599609375
13945/28840	He took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the	35.768310546875
13946/28840	At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart	66.14874267578125
13947/28840	He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning to strike eleventhe door of his study	48.371639251708984
13948/28840	Morrel did not turn roundhe expected these words of Cocles The agent of Thomson 	75.07646942138672
13949/28840	He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his	47.27460479736328
13950/28840	Suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters	87.69547271728516
13951/28840	My father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joysaved you are saved And she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk	36.717140197753906

13953/28840	Morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to	40.79789733886719
13954/28840	At one end was the receipted bill for the 287000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment _Julies Dowry	44.90816116333008
13955/28840	Morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a	18.555471420288086
13956/28840	At this moment the clock struck	59.801719665527344
13957/28840	He felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his	135.0489501953125

13963/28840	Monsieur Morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs Monsieur Morrel   It is his voice said	22.98478889465332

13967/28840	In a moment they were at the Canebi	24.559621810913086

13974/28840	To doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the	91.26111602783203
13975/28840	Italy Sinbad the Sailor   Towards the beginning of the year 1838 two young men belonging to the first society of Paris the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz dÉpinay were at	12.948131561279297
13976/28840	They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year and that Franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy should act as _cicerone_ to	40.85374069213867
13977/28840	Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per di	53.80976867675781
13978/28840	They accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left Albert started for	115.78419494628906
13979/28840	He traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and reembarked for Marc	64.65158081054688

13981/28840	The sport was bad Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of	131.49913024902344
13982/28840	Ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital	48.84653854370117
13983/28840	Where   Do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo	58.67816925048828
13984/28840	Well what is this island   The Island of Monte Crist	8.946839332580566
13985/28840	But I have no permission to shoot over this	82.7051773071289

13988/28840	It is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of	48.127201080322266

13991/28840	Who live upon the stones I suppose said Franz with an incredulous	74.53990936279297
13992/28840	No but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the	23.670421600341797
13993/28840	As Franz had sufficient time and his apartments at Rome were not yet available he accepted the	112.89633178710938
13994/28840	Upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low	53.655616760253906
13995/28840	Well asked he what now Is there any difficulty in the way  	35.66537857055664
13996/28840	replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected	76.4482192993164
13997/28840	The deuce That puts a different face on the	174.14889526367188

13999/28840	But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo   Oh I shall not cried	25.700071334838867
14000/28840	Nor I nor I chorused the	339.0627746582031
14001/28840	The captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the	31.570791244506836
14002/28840	Franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward and one at the helmhe resumed the	92.73871612548828
14003/28840	Gaetano said he to the captain you tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the	42.869415283203125
14004/28840	Yes your excellency and it is	13.336627960205078
14005/28840	I knew there were smugglers but I thought that since the capture of Algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of Cooper and Captain Marry	61.35834503173828
14006/28840	Your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo	42.38336944580078
14007/28840	and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of	80.86466979980469
14008/28840	Has not your excellency heard that the French _chargé daffaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of Velletri   Oh yes I heard	31.741527557373047
14009/28840	Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a	71.891357421875
14010/28840	But asked Franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French Sardinian or Tuscan governments   Why said Gaetano with a	24.352134704589844
14011/28840	At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle	61.29462432861328
14012/28840	First one gunl goes under then the	803.351806640625
14013/28840	Then they lift and sink again and both go under at	465.0727233886719
14014/28840	All at once theres a noise like a cannonthats the air blowing up the	43.834625244140625
14015/28840	He was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable cool	33.640907287597656
14016/28840	Bah said he I have travelled through Sicily and CalabriaI have sailed two months in the Archipelago and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a	28.489347457885742
14017/28840	I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied Gaetano but you questioned me and I have answered thats	32.967838287353516
14018/28840	Yes and your conversation is most interesting and as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for Monte Crist	31.25647735595703
14019/28840	The wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their	44.520721435546875
14020/28840	As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crev	43.65926742553711
14021/28840	As for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishingboats with their white sails were alone	29.770336151123047
14022/28840	Hush said the captain it is a	81.42769622802734
14023/28840	But you told me the island was uninhabited   I said there were no fixed habitations on it but I said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for	81.38231658935547
14024/28840	And for pirates   And for pirates returned Gaetano repeating Franzs	41.77772903442383
14025/28840	It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind	43.27494430541992
14026/28840	It seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a	54.86146926879883
14027/28840	Oh that goes for nothing said Gaet	104.16360473632812
14028/28840	If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa but only from the	37.07622146606445
14029/28840	You think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors   That is what we must find out returned Gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial	41.137821197509766
14030/28840	How can you find out   You shall	34.260921478271484
14031/28840	Gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the	66.01467895507812
14032/28840	The pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of	52.16600799560547
14033/28840	Gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to	68.61033630371094
14034/28840	All this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was	81.87677001953125
14035/28840	Gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be	53.93238830566406
14036/28840	As for Franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two doublebarrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited	36.324134826660156
14037/28840	This track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the	65.94941711425781
14038/28840	Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on	42.64002990722656
14039/28840	Well exclaimed Franz and the sailors in	134.84593200683594
14040/28840	They are Spanish smugglers said he they have with them two Corsican	69.65155029296875
14041/28840	And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers   Alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one	42.09955596923828
14042/28840	This costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellowcreature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without	75.28866577148438
14043/28840	Ah said Franz then you are a smuggler occasionally Gaetano   Your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetr	28.79221534729004
14044/28840	Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo   Oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by	44.12240982055664
14045/28840	And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land   Nothing at all smugglers are not	34.63712692260742
14046/28840	But these two Corsican bandits said Franz calculating the chances of	61.47282409667969
14047/28840	It is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the	60.99117660522461
14048/28840	How so   Because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a Corsicans nature to revenge	58.50202178955078
14049/28840	What do you mean by having made a stiffhaving assassinated a man said Franz continuing his	86.27592468261719
14050/28840	I mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the	24.060014724731445
14051/28840	Well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and	23.8956298828125
14052/28840	Do you think they will grant it   Without	51.56794357299805
14053/28840	How many are they   Four and the two bandits make	107.20549774169922
14054/28840	Just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to Monte Crist	40.66499710083008
14055/28840	Yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due	17.89287757873535
14056/28840	By all means be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses I do more than permit I exhort	55.24800491333008
14057/28840	For a man who like Franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave	73.90779876708984
14058/28840	On the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and	57.7737922668457
14059/28840	The history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his	49.53846740722656
14060/28840	The sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the	64.76163482666016
14061/28840	Through the darkness Franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons	56.98581314086914
14062/28840	The blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces	67.73883819580078
14063/28840	Gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the	76.53182220458984
14064/28840	At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landingplace their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the newcomers were and what were their	54.9825439453125
14065/28840	They soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was ro	47.93925857543945
14066/28840	When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried Who comes there in Sard	46.98822021484375
14067/28840	Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned	53.16405487060547
14068/28840	Will your excellency give your name or remain _incognito_ asked the	38.42724609375
14069/28840	My name must rest unknown replied Franz merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for	276.1820983886719
14070/28840	As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the	61.192501068115234
14071/28840	Not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied Franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each	70.0437240600586
14072/28840	The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said _Saccommodi	24.57063865661621
14073/28840	The Italian _saccommodi_ is untranslatable it means at once Come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the	89.05103302001953
14074/28840	It is like that Turkish phrase of Molières that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utter	119.59368896484375
14075/28840	The sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land Gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came	55.35417175292969
14076/28840	One of his guns was swung over his shoulder Gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquiet	67.07660675048828
14077/28840	Gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their	52.34351348876953
14078/28840	They advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry	66.80070495605469
14079/28840	Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrt	26.84711265563965
14080/28840	Franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the haltingplaces of the wandering visitors of Monte Crist	45.418785095214844
14081/28840	As for his suspicions once on _terra firma_ once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to	83.77266693115234
14082/28840	He mentioned this to Gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them	73.53727722167969
14083/28840	Besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you I will go and offer them two of our birds for a	65.06674194335938
14084/28840	You are a born diplomat returned Franz go and	186.53005981445312
14085/28840	Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a	66.43672180175781
14086/28840	Franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious	75.4688491821289
14087/28840	Well said Franz anything newdo they refuse   On the contrary returned Gaetano the chief who was told you were a young Frenchman invites you to sup with	34.93513488769531
14088/28840	Well observed Franz this chief is very polite and I see no objectionthe more so as I bring my share of the	82.08140563964844
14089/28840	Oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his	76.54830932617188
14090/28840	His house Has he built one here then   No but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they	76.59125518798828

14093/28840	Franz looked at Gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this	53.598758697509766
14094/28840	Ah replied he guessing Franzs thought I know this is a serious	97.5433120727539
14095/28840	What should you do in my place   I who have nothing to loseI should	32.83519744873047

14097/28840	There is something very peculiar about this chief then   Listen said Gaetano lowering his voice I do not know if what they say is truehe stopped to see if anyone was	48.663124084472656
14098/28840	What do they say   That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is	36.546539306640625
14099/28840	It is no nonsense it is quite	55.53802490234375

14101/28840	Do you know observed Franz that with such stories you make me think of Ali Babas enchanted cavern   I tell you what I have been	33.0763053894043
14102/28840	Then you advise me to accept   Oh I dont say that your excellency will do as you please I should be sorry to advise you in the	19.662473678588867
14103/28840	Franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper	94.22659301757812
14104/28840	Franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his	247.37496948242188

14112/28840	Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to	49.0721549987793

14120/28840	Where will he receive me   No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you	31.785724639892578
14121/28840	Decidedly muttered Franz this is an Arabian Nights	193.1540069580078
14122/28840	His excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sent	26.3232364654541
14123/28840	He was accompanied by two of the yachts	59.326744079589844
14124/28840	Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to	14.1275634765625
14125/28840	Without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indisc	67.4802474975586
14126/28840	Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the band	58.633026123046875
14127/28840	Then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sent	44.47908401489258

14129/28840	At length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of	188.0238800048828
14130/28840	There was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent French although with a foreign accent said   Welcome	80.26055145263672
14131/28840	I beg you will remove your band	69.64667510986328
14132/28840	His pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of	44.2413330078125
14133/28840	He was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the South had small hands and	145.05372619628906
14134/28840	But what astonished Franz who had treated Gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found	74.53862762451172
14135/28840	The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of	66.44004821777344
14136/28840	The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off	150.1031036376953
14137/28840	Let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable	50.88350296020508
14138/28840	_Ma foi_ my dear sir replied Franz make no	38.75703811645508

14140/28840	But such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yours to share if you	67.63490295410156
14141/28840	Ali is the supper ready   At this moment the tapestry moved aside and a Nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining	26.228681564331055
14142/28840	Now said the unknown to Franz I do not know if you are of my opinion but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one	34.987030029296875
14143/28840	Pray observe that I too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or	222.3093719482422

14146/28840	And I replied Franz will tell you as I only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin that I see no reason why at this moment I should not be called Al	66.53741455078125
14147/28840	That will keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some good	68.09416961669922
14148/28840	Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around	113.46224212646484
14149/28840	The diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their	46.50544357299805

14155/28840	Ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host there	77.66761779785156
14156/28840	Yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and graceyes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove	48.86907958984375
14157/28840	He remembers that I saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his	71.102294921875
14158/28840	Ali approached his master took his hand and kissed	27.316328048706055
14159/28840	Would it be impertinent Signor Sinbad said Franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness   20081m       Oh they are simple enough replied the	21.83556365966797
14160/28840	He hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devils	57.172386169433594

14163/28840	Franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the halfkindness halfcruelty with which his host related the brief	81.50965881347656

14166/28840	Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary fer	43.357295989990234

14183/28840	The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample	100.61251068115234
14184/28840	Then Ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the	39.74840545654297
14185/28840	Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver	53.83028793334961
14186/28840	The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused Franzs	97.90613555908203

14188/28840	He replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his	56.76074981689453

14209/28840	They both arose and while he who called himself Sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant Franz entered still another	210.86322021484375
14210/28840	It was round and a large divan completely encircled	48.75499725341797

14220/28840	As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in	37.24250793457031

14231/28840	He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of	46.291908264160156
14232/28840	He found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure	39.51556396484375
14233/28840	The air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the	52.97402572631836
14234/28840	There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as	38.850303649902344
14235/28840	He recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hash	67.39895629882812
14236/28840	It seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his	76.66692352294922
14237/28840	Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and	65.19833374023438

14244/28840	After a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then Franz heard a slight	50.83333969116211

14249/28840	Ah yes I understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted	103.09310150146484
14250/28840	With much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and I will get you the torch you ask	47.423614501953125
14251/28840	But I too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but I have always given it	44.69572448730469
14252/28840	Giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excell	46.56842803955078
14253/28840	Franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by Gaet	35.49223709106445
14254/28840	He recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the gro	48.605403900146484
14255/28840	He saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in	147.19635009765625
14256/28840	All was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly	135.38067626953125
14257/28840	At the end of this time he gave up his search and Gaetano	38.10894775390625
14258/28840	When Franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the	80.57099151611328
14259/28840	He looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish	65.21599578857422
14260/28840	Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly	30.84767723083496
14261/28840	He took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two	24.591848373413086
14262/28840	These animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and Franz could not consider them as	166.10891723632812
14263/28840	Moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his	181.83570861816406
14264/28840	Since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the _Thousand and One Nights_ and he was irresistibly attracted towards the gro	17.34962272644043
14265/28840	Then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two	37.654945373535156
14266/28840	The second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast	91.44428253173828
14267/28840	Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a seagull on the wave continuing her flight towards Cors	52.747737884521484
14268/28840	Why he remarked to Gaetano you told me that Signor Sinbad was going to Malaga while it seems he is in the direction of PortoVec	23.37050437927246
14269/28840	Dont you remember said the patron I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands   True and he is going to land them added	31.960336685180664
14270/28840	Ah he is one who fears neither God nor Satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a	83.67509460449219
14271/28840	20093m       But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said	31.155967712402344
14272/28840	And what cares he for that replied Gaetano with a laugh or any authorities He smiles at	126.50350952148438
14273/28840	As to Franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Crist	19.25472640991211
14274/28840	He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under	43.60667037963867
14275/28840	At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of PortoVec	46.439517974853516
14276/28840	With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper Sinbad hashish statuesall became a dream for	59.90943145751953
14277/28840	The boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of Monte Crist	47.7163200378418
14278/28840	When Franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at	50.836708068847656
14279/28840	He set out and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mailco	51.73862838745117
14280/28840	An apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrinis	30.95241355895996
14281/28840	At last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the	68.17278289794922
14282/28840	On his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackneycoachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the Hôtel de Lond	39.24347686767578
14283/28840	Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini and asked for Albert de Morcer	13.749794006347656
14284/28840	The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a par	59.74189376831055
14285/28840	The two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable	56.594512939453125
14286/28840	The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller	63.86410140991211
14287/28840	Very good signor Pastrini said Franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following	66.70288848876953
14288/28840	As to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage   What as to the carriage exclaimed	71.49895477294922
14289/28840	Come come Signor Pastrini no joking we must have a	35.07856369018555
14290/28840	Sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all I can	28.976776123046875
14291/28840	And when shall we know inquired	194.48086547851562
14292/28840	Oh the deuce then we shall pay the more thats all I see plainly	90.52130126953125
14293/28840	At Drakes or Aarons one pays twentyfive lire for common days and thirty or thirtyfive lire a day more for Sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and theres an end of	79.2004165649414
14294/28840	I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a	93.82872009277344
14295/28840	Then they must put horses to	354.0986328125
14296/28840	It is a little worse for the journey but thats no	61.51944351196289
14297/28840	Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not	56.195343017578125
14298/28840	Do you understand that my dear Franzno horses he said but cant we have posthorses   They have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for	76.11663818359375
14299/28840	What are we to say to this asked	60.767242431640625
14300/28840	I say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension I am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to	69.47525024414062
14301/28840	Is supper ready Signor Pastrini   Yes your excell	12.788826942443848
14302/28840	But the carriage and horses said	138.2445526123047
14303/28840	Be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for	67.0971450805664
14304/28840	Morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or welllined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six	121.5472412109375
14305/28840	Roman Bandits   The next morning Franz woke first and instantly rang the	55.67856216430664
14306/28840	The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself	34.503257751464844
14307/28840	What is the matter said Albert entering no carriage to be had   Just so returned Franz you have guessed	53.655696868896484
14308/28840	Well your Eternal City is a nice sort of	52.26122283935547
14309/28840	Ah that is something said Albert today is Thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday   Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied Franz which will make it still more	58.95967483520508
14310/28840	My friend said Morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the	35.06629943847656
14311/28840	At least we can have a window   Where   In the Cor	46.77425003051758
14312/28840	Ah a window exclaimed Signor Pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a	40.92430114746094
14313/28840	The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupef	7.034967422485352
14314/28840	Well said Franz to Albert do you know what is the best thing we can do It is to pass the Carnival at Venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have car	42.6577262878418
14315/28840	Ah the devil no cried Albert I came to Rome to see the Carnival and I will though I see it on st	82.43087768554688
14316/28840	We will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes and we shall have complete	68.00292205810547
14317/28840	But excellencysaid Pastrini still striving to gain his	42.11098098754883
14318/28840	Do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned Signor Pastrini with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat I will do all I can and I hope you will be	25.74908447265625
14319/28840	When do you wish the carriage to be here   In an	29.947818756103516
14320/28840	In an hour it will be at the	16.547075271606445
14321/28840	Excellency cried the _cicerone_ seeing Franz approach the window shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace   Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to	36.934837341308594
14322/28840	Franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the Hôtel de Londres was the	24.299531936645508
14323/28840	The genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that	170.3103485107422
14324/28840	Franz and Albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the _cicerone_ sprang into the seat	48.24562454223633
14325/28840	Where do your excellencies wish to go asked	41.99516677856445
14326/28840	To Saint Peters first and then to the Colosseum returned	46.472511291503906
14327/28840	But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peters and a month to study	56.49951934814453
14328/28840	The day was passed at Saint Peters	179.80691528320312
14329/28840	Suddenly the daylight began to fade away Franz took out his watchit was halfpast	46.009071350097656
14330/28840	They returned to the hotel at the door Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at	23.886981964111328
14331/28840	He wished to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him Saint Peters by	43.115203857421875
14332/28840	When we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have	143.86314392089844
14333/28840	Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable rep	49.29615020751953
14334/28840	At the end of the dinner he entered in	71.61766815185547
14335/28840	Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was	77.93135070800781
14336/28840	Excellency said Pastrini I am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that I	25.923351287841797
14337/28840	Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked Albert lighting his	43.52625274658203
14338/28840	No and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at Rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of	51.732940673828125
14339/28840	It is much more convenient at Pariswhen anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done	147.27239990234375
14340/28840	That is what all the French say returned Signor Pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason I do not understand why they	36.3739128112793
14341/28840	But said Albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do	90.85934448242188
14342/28840	Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder their walk on the Boulevard de Gand and the Café de	20.52259635925293
14343/28840	It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its wait	73.98381805419922
14344/28840	Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very	48.50130081176758
14345/28840	You mean the Colosseum   It is the same	23.17865562438965
14346/28840	You have told your coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo to drive round the walls and reenter by the Porta San Giovanni   These are my words	23.60118293762207
14347/28840	Impossible   Very dangerous to say the	87.33363342285156
14348/28840	Dangerousand why   On account of the famous Luigi V	82.22132873535156
14349/28840	Pray who may this famous Luigi Vampa be inquired Albert he may be very famous at Rome but I can assure you he is quite unknown at	102.27019500732422
14350/28840	What do you not know him   I have not that	16.455589294433594
14351/28840	You have never heard his name  	28.403261184692383
14352/28840	Well then he is a bandit compared to whom the Decesaris and the Gasparones were mere	48.235294342041016
14353/28840	Now then Albert cried Franz here is a bandit for you at	52.21084976196289
14354/28840	I forewarn you Signor Pastrini that I shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this	30.838359832763672
14355/28840	Once upon a time Well go	404.797119140625
14356/28840	Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many Frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend	40.574607849121094
14357/28840	But if your excellency doubt my veracity   Signor Pastrini returned Franz you are more susceptible than Cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your	37.38482666015625
14358/28840	Come sit down and tell us all about this Signor V	34.41307830810547
14359/28840	I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of Mastr	27.765239715576172
14360/28840	Because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the	148.82098388671875
14361/28840	On your honor is that true cried	157.9191436767578
14362/28840	Count returned Signor Pastrini hurt at Alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions I do not say this to you but to your companion who knows Rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed	44.41624450683594
14363/28840	My dear fellow said Albert turning to Franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and doublebarrelled	23.55793571472168
14364/28840	Whilst Albert proposed this scheme Signor Pastrinis face assumed an expression impossible to	112.37696838378906
14365/28840	And pray asked Franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage   Not out of my armory for at Terracina I was plundered even of my hunting	44.40304183959961
14366/28840	And you   I shared the same fate at Aquapend	59.265586853027344
14367/28840	Do you know Signor Pastrini said Albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their	28.461904525756836
14368/28840	Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to Franz as the only one likely to listen with	57.89052200317383
14369/28840	Your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by	58.34178161621094
14370/28840	What cried Albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance   No for it would be	24.735197067260742
14371/28840	What could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you   Eh _parbleu_they should kill	82.84640502929688
14372/28840	The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say Your friend is decidedly	46.2708854675293
14373/28840	Albert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_ which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible	44.79844284057617
14374/28840	Well Signor Pastrini said Franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this Luigi V	32.83843231201172
14375/28840	Is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short Describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like Jean Sbogar or Lara we may recognize	61.28740692138672
14376/28840	Let us see the watch said	313.9755859375
14377/28840	Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet bearing the name of its maker of Parisian manufacture and a counts coron	77.5416259765625
14378/28840	_Peste_ returned Albert I compliment you on it I have its fellowhe took his watch from his waistcoat pocketand it cost me 3000 franc	72.9361343383789
14379/28840	Let us hear the history said Franz motioning Signor Pastrini to seat	54.60710525512695

14381/28840	_Pardieu_ cried Albert you are not a preacher to remain standing   The host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning Luigi V	38.60694885253906
14382/28840	What do you think of that Albertat twoandtwenty to be thus famous   Yes and at his age Alexander Cæsar and Napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind	49.298744201660156
14383/28840	So continued Franz the hero of this history is only twoandtwenty   Scarcely so	25.638164520263672

14391/28840	The same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of styl	63.332576751708984

14474/28840	The names of all including Carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of Diavolacc	26.486726760864258
14475/28840	He was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief and to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his	34.741966247558594
14476/28840	A large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profuse	174.5451202392578

14486/28840	This apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of Carlini who remained seated and ate and drank	56.26180648803711
14487/28840	Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid Rita at the captains	40.99696731567383
14488/28840	Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the band	23.09622573852539
14489/28840	A knife was plunged up to the hilt in Ritas left	60.704017639160156

14492/28840	All savage natures appreciate a desperate	228.0132598876953
14493/28840	No other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what Carlini had	52.58312225341797

14495/28840	Carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of fire	51.583518981933594
14496/28840	Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the	25.94878387451172
14497/28840	At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the	62.74399185180664
14498/28840	It was Ritas father who brought his daughters ransom in	53.76438522338867
14499/28840	Here said he to Cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my	24.620548248291016
14500/28840	But the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to	42.5926628112793
14501/28840	They both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moon	75.57987976074219
14502/28840	Cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a	19.8460693359375
14503/28840	There said he demand thy child of Carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his	45.24684143066406
14504/28840	The old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his	57.25559616088867
14505/28840	At length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not	52.22663497924805
14506/28840	As he approached Carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans	28.65082359313965
14507/28840	A woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the womans face became	30.686296463012695
14508/28840	The old man recognized his child and Carlini recognized the old	37.27006149291992
14509/28840	I expected thee said the bandit to Ritas	33.87459945678711
14510/28840	Wretch returned the old man what hast thou done and he gazed with terror on Rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bos	78.73572540283203
14511/28840	A ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the	25.94301986694336
14512/28840	Cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit I loved her therefore I slew her for she would have served as the sport of the whole	42.43670654296875
14513/28840	The old man spoke not and grew pale as	148.61965942382812
14514/28840	Now continued Carlini if I have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in Ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his	34.51860427856445
14515/28840	Thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my	68.01407623291016
14516/28840	20115m       Carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss	21.6987361907959
14517/28840	These were the first tears the man of blood had ever we	132.68243408203125
14518/28840	Now said the old man aid me to bury my	37.28688430786133
14519/28840	Carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to rep	28.9257869720459
14520/28840	When the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the	115.20648956298828
14521/28840	Then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the	70.54729461669922
14522/28840	Then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was	61.07866287231445
14523/28840	Then extending his hand the old man said I thank you my son and now leave me	40.053367614746094
14524/28840	Carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the	47.70609664916992
14525/28840	It had been resolved the night before to change their encamp	61.791893005371094
14526/28840	An hour before daybreak Cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to	62.46538543701172
14527/28840	But Carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of Ritas	27.113555908203125
14528/28840	He went toward the place where he had left	24.976318359375
14529/28840	He found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters	59.1395149230957
14530/28840	He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the	46.13273239135742
14531/28840	But he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the Roman carbineers Carlini was	41.21865463256836
14532/28840	There was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his	66.44537353515625
14533/28840	That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlinis rear when he	34.921443939208984
14534/28840	On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated	44.57890319824219
14535/28840	They told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the	229.64659118652344
14536/28840	Thus from Fondi to Perusia everyone trembles at the name of Cucumet	54.60319900512695
14537/28840	These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between Luigi and	172.848876953125
14538/28840	Time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of	74.80748748779297
14539/28840	They were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and	103.68860626220703
14540/28840	One day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards	29.06610870361328
14541/28840	Instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the	50.71019744873047
14542/28840	The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question	79.88648223876953

14544/28840	Cucumetto cried Luigi and Teresa at the same	26.393983840942383
14545/28840	Yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch	31.021881103515625
14546/28840	Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be	57.06719970703125
14547/28840	Yes it is very annoying said Vampa but we have not seen	16.783710479736328

14549/28840	Vampa then removed the stone and Cucumetto came	39.53036880493164
14550/28840	Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their par	33.07667541503906
14551/28840	He had read in the countenances of Luigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to	38.50876235961914
14552/28840	But Vampa raised his head proudly as to Teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of	49.98217010498047
14553/28840	Several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumet	46.87946319580078

14561/28840	Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday	142.4222869873047
14562/28840	They both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and	89.54022979736328
14563/28840	The _festa_ was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the gardenwal	31.027400970458984

14568/28840	They were attired as peasants of Albano Velletri CivitaCastellana and	18.02330207824707
14569/28840	We need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and	51.35823059082031
14570/28840	Carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady	93.97872161865234
14571/28840	Carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her	68.86199188232422
14572/28840	The Count of SanFelice pointed out Teresa who was hanging on Luigis arm in a group of	41.697784423828125
14573/28840	Will you allow me father said Carm	275.2852783203125
14574/28840	Certainly replied the count are we not in Carnival time   Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to	27.80409812927246
14575/28840	The young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to Teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts	42.309879302978516
14576/28840	Teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at Luigi who could not refuse his ass	194.7527618408203
14577/28840	Luigi slowly relinquished Teresas arm which he had held beneath his own and Teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadr	96.10960388183594
14578/28840	Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his	233.62644958496094
14579/28840	It was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole	42.73270797729492
14580/28840	He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his	83.85794830322266
14581/28840	Luigi was jealous   He felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition Teresa might escape	136.38055419921875
14582/28840	The young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered	128.07449340820312
14583/28840	We have said that Teresa was handsome but this is not all Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegan	41.41280746459961
14584/28840	She had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the Count of SanFelices daughter we will not undertake to say that Carmela was not jealous of	23.135427474975586
14585/28840	And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where Luigi awaited	44.93080139160156
14586/28840	Thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers	70.43086242675781
14587/28840	The quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition Carmela alone objecting to it but the Count of SanFelice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acc	25.93457794189453
14588/28840	One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had	33.53831100463867
14589/28840	The truth was that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed Teresa toward another part of the	109.33494567871094
14590/28840	Teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within	57.9332160949707
14591/28840	She herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching	61.181880950927734
14592/28840	Why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were mer	47.79597854614258
14593/28840	However to Teresas great astonishment Luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the	94.7279052734375

14595/28840	Do you desire it as ardently as you say  	24.495885848999023
14596/28840	Well then you shall have it   The young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her	18.766216278076172
14597/28840	As Luigi spoke thus he left	429.2869873046875

14599/28840	20121m       That night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the	38.106266021728516
14600/28840	The Villa of SanFelice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely Carm	61.53640365600586
14601/28840	Awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressinggown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the	35.94221878051758
14602/28840	When she recovered her father was by her	138.40206909179688
14603/28840	All the servants surrounded her offering her	323.7702331542969
14604/28840	An entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured   Her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen	71.14157104492188
14605/28840	Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized	88.16082763671875

14608/28840	The young girl was very pensive but seeing Luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a	77.2860336303711

14611/28840	Teresa said Luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts	126.63037872314453
14612/28840	Yes replied Teresa with astonishment but I was mad to utter such a	47.831905364990234
14613/28840	And I replied Very well you shall have	69.79234313964844
14614/28840	Yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi but of course your reply was only to please	71.94149017333984
14615/28840	I have promised no more than I have given you Teresa said Luigi	40.22344207763672
14616/28840	Go into the grotto and dress	157.34197998046875
14617/28840	Teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking Luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing	64.11185455322266
14618/28840	When he saw Luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward	20.61916160583496
14619/28840	Luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up	48.808406829833984
14620/28840	In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross	72.64287567138672
14621/28840	On arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to	49.04154586791992
14622/28840	That is your road excellency and now you cannot again	111.31487274169922
14623/28840	And here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of	67.59163665771484
14624/28840	Thank you said Luigi drawing back his hand I render a service I do not sell	104.16464233398438
14625/28840	Well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a	40.51725387573242
14626/28840	Then said the traveller take these two Venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of ear	36.453704833984375
14627/28840	And then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between Albano and CivitaCastell	23.805410385131836
14628/28840	I accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequ	42.990081787109375
14629/28840	For a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piast	136.3684539794922
14630/28840	What is your name inquired the	51.145668029785156
14631/28840	Luigi Vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied Alexander King of Maced	143.7987518310547
14632/28840	And yours   I said the traveller am called Sinbad the	25.688575744628906
14633/28840	Yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to Vampa as his	41.665409088134766

14635/28840	The name of Sinbad the Sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous	27.28499984741211
14636/28840	Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had	47.18798828125
14637/28840	As he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a	14.726461410522461
14638/28840	He listened to know whence this sound could	339.6968078613281
14639/28840	A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced	99.49393463134766
14640/28840	He bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the	29.36970329284668
14641/28840	Three cries for help came more distinctly to his	257.3620300292969
14642/28840	He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa as Nessus the centaur carried Deian	138.69882202148438
14643/28840	This man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the	41.89740753173828
14644/28840	Vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking	39.27527618408203
14645/28840	The young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then	36.63087844848633

14648/28840	Vampa then rushed towards Teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrot	50.8712158203125
14649/28840	Fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome	172.3626251220703
14650/28840	When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded	46.95448684692383
14651/28840	He had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of	76.37268829345703
14652/28840	Vampa approached the corpse and recognized Cucumet	40.10615921020508
14653/28840	From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of Teresa and had sworn she should be	42.73225784301758
14654/28840	Vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary Teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her	38.318851470947266
14655/28840	Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress   Ah said hegood good You are dressed it is now my turn to dress	65.99270629882812
14656/28840	20125m       Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of SanFelices	18.558116912841797

14660/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of	25.657493591308594
14661/28840	Vampa in this attire resembled a painting by Léopold Robert or Schn	32.454280853271484
14662/28840	He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumet	18.959842681884766
14663/28840	The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his	28.521364212036133
14664/28840	Now he said to Teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be   Oh yes exclaimed the young girl	23.315074920654297
14665/28840	And follow me wherever I go   To the worlds	72.60509490966797

14691/28840	And what may that be inquired the bandits with aston	76.52867889404297
14692/28840	I come to ask to be your captain said the young	23.797929763793945
14693/28840	And what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the	46.243038177490234
14694/28840	I have killed your chief Cucumetto whose dress I now wear and I set fire to the villa SanFelice to procure a weddingdress for my betrot	24.66419792175293
14695/28840	An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain vice Cucumetto	93.91322326660156
14696/28840	20129m       Well my dear Albert said Franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa   I say he is a myth replied Albert and never had an	21.005388259887695
14697/28840	And what may a myth be inquired Pastr	67.9732894897461
14698/28840	The explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied	135.1949462890625
14699/28840	And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome   And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an	38.50357437133789
14700/28840	Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him   Why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the Tiber and the smugglers of the	34.971683502197266
14701/28840	And how does he behave towards travellers   Alas his plan is very	77.74577331542969
14702/28840	It depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours	72.55145263671875
14703/28840	At the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistolshot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the	75.38066101074219
14704/28840	Well Albert inquired Franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall   Quite so said Albert if the way be pictures	23.353689193725586
14705/28840	The clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman	25.53215217590332
14706/28840	Excellencies said he the coach is	250.1279754638672
14707/28840	Well then said Franz let us to the Colosse	16.812931060791016
14708/28840	By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets your excellencies   By the streets _morbleu_ by the streets cried	33.81013488769531
14709/28840	Ah my dear fellow said Albert rising and lighting his third cigar really I thought you had more	70.87056732177734
14710/28840	So saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the	21.212278366088867
14711/28840	The Colosseum   Franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to	46.84898376464844
14712/28840	This itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed	47.4408073425293
14713/28840	Seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of	70.0391845703125
14714/28840	The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a _cicerone_ who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his	30.748979568481445
14715/28840	As for Albert and Franz they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their	30.907873153686523
14716/28840	Thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conduct	75.57205200195312
14717/28840	All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself	51.57555389404297
14718/28840	Conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery	47.33766174316406
14719/28840	The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like Franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the	106.90247344970703
14720/28840	And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some	100.03462219238281
14721/28840	By a sort of instinctive impulse Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his	101.1266860961914
14722/28840	About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with	55.46990203857422
14723/28840	The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made	57.82218933105469
14724/28840	He wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed	55.59284210205078
14725/28840	The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black	82.05913543701172
14726/28840	20135m       From the imperfect means Franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of	71.1729507446289
14727/28840	The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere	31.803211212158203
14728/28840	I beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the Roman dialect but I dont think Im many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Later	35.5450439453125
14729/28840	Say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest Tuscan tis I who am too	64.40582275390625
14730/28840	But even if you had caused me to wait a little while I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of	27.770668029785156
14731/28840	Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man I came here direct from the Castle of	86.97821807861328

14733/28840	And who is Beppo   Oh Beppo is employed in the prison and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss	49.53759765625
14734/28840	Indeed You are a provident person I	55.621826171875
14735/28840	Why you see no one knows what may	22.402996063232422
14736/28840	Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of	39.08121109008789
14737/28840	Briefly what did you learn   That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at Rome at the commencement of all great	51.41437530517578
14738/28840	One of the culprits will be _mazzolato_3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest	34.81785583496094
14739/28840	The other sufferer is sentenced to be _decapitato_4 and he your excellency is poor Pepp	25.707862854003906
14740/28840	The fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an	89.24542999267578
14741/28840	But Peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with	70.23396301269531
14742/28840	Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and	198.4842071533203
14743/28840	Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise them	184.97462463378906
14744/28840	My good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant	60.71985626220703
14745/28840	Perhaps I am but one thing I have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served	51.55604934692383
14746/28840	I should hate and despise myself as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extrem	127.00631713867188
14747/28840	That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than	39.24736022949219
14748/28840	And what is your excellencys project   Just	15.78735637664795
14749/28840	I will so advantageously bestow 2000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino and during that year another skilfully placed 1000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his	42.77793502807617
14750/28840	And do you feel sure of succeeding   _Pardieu_ exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in	20.412094116210938
14751/28840	What did your excellency say inquired the	28.860137939453125
14752/28840	I said my good fellow that I would do more singlehanded by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses	54.02384948730469
14753/28840	Leave me then to act and have no fears for the	64.09458923339844
14754/28840	At least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should	63.204898834228516
14755/28840	Take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I	67.31336212158203
14756/28840	Remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work	34.16752624511719
14757/28840	And what of that Is not a day divided into twentyfour hours each hour into sixty minutes and every minute subdivided into sixty seconds Now in 86400 seconds very many things can be	76.06514739990234
14758/28840	And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or	26.46430015563965
14759/28840	I have engaged the three lower windows at the Café Rospoli should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on	50.61927032470703
14760/28840	And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution   Send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and I will give it to	45.42350769042969
14761/28840	Your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not   Nay I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the	28.172880172729492
14762/28840	Well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to	111.33403015136719
14763/28840	Have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for I may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when I in my turn may require your aid and	94.81354522705078
14764/28840	Tis some travellers who are visiting the Colosseum by torch	30.020042419433594
14765/28840	Well then if you obtain the reprieve   The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red	26.202388763427734
14766/28840	And if you fail   Then all three windows will have yellow draper	59.3688850402832
14767/28840	And then   And then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your	35.38234329223633
14768/28840	Adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as I do upon	41.15642547607422
14769/28840	Saying these words the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to Franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of	41.36404037475586
14770/28840	The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert who made the lofty building reecho with the sound of his friends	151.6793975830078
14771/28840	Franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his	65.3347396850586
14772/28840	Franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had	69.88102722167969
14773/28840	And the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer Sinbad the	44.29079055786133
14774/28840	As we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another	110.5575180053711
14775/28840	In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of	90.8266372680664
14776/28840	Worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till	72.38307189941406
14777/28840	Like a genuine Frenchman Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro Argentina and Franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the	38.72235870361328
14778/28840	Yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more seriousminded companion would have taken weeks to	73.12843322753906
14779/28840	Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the Teatro Argentina and also what performers appeared in	71.7281265258789
14780/28840	The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for representation and the principal actors were Coselli Moriani and La Specch	60.601348876953125
14781/28840	The young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_ supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of	33.82341003417969
14782/28840	Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general	45.2308349609375
14783/28840	It was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling	72.03447723388672
14784/28840	The Carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to	92.83743286132812
14785/28840	With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate	35.15566635131836
14786/28840	The truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival with the Holy Week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the	70.68646240234375
14787/28840	Towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris where indeed he had imagined she still	91.59982299804688
14788/28840	And her name is   Countess	44.3532829284668
14789/28840	Ah I know her by name exclaimed Albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as	85.8272705078125
14790/28840	I was to have been presented to her when I met her at Madame Villeforts	33.25121307373047
14791/28840	Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence asked	126.9928207397461
14792/28840	At that instant the countess perceived Franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the	43.24481964111328
14793/28840	Upon my word said Albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful count	29.202733993530273
14794/28840	Is there indeed my good fellow Pray tell me is it sympathy of heart   No of taste continued Franz grave	77.6470718383789
14795/28840	And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced   By the countesss visiting the Colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly	45.67818069458008
14796/28840	You were with her then   I	41.449363708496094
14797/28840	20143m       And you will probably find your theme illch	25.779863357543945
14798/28840	But said Albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the	127.76274108886719
14799/28840	Are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks   Certainly directly the curtain falls on the	42.854339599609375
14800/28840	What a confounded long time this first act	109.43608093261719
14801/28840	I believe on my soul that they never mean to finish	76.72145080566406
14802/28840	Oh yes they will only listen to that charming	115.90633392333984
14803/28840	But what an awkward inelegant fellow he	336.3834228515625
14804/28840	At least you must admire Morianis style and	1292.38134765625
14805/28840	I never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a wom	90.98841857910156
14806/28840	My good friend said Franz turning to him while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to	62.83806610107422
14807/28840	This important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss	47.64176940917969
14808/28840	At the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the Italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other	43.236724853515625
14809/28840	Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew	87.95339965820312
14810/28840	Franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up Alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the	69.22805786132812
14811/28840	Sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a Greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national	76.24427795410156
14812/28840	Behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to	44.42812728881836
14813/28840	Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either	96.22140502929688
14814/28840	All I can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season for I saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a	42.16758346557617
14815/28840	Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black	64.44327545166016
14816/28840	And what do you think of her personal appearance   Oh I consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what Medora must have	28.687835693359375
14817/28840	Franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with Albert while Franz returned to his previous survey of the house and	48.76054000854492
14818/28840	Of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial	104.51883697509766
14819/28840	The ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted	126.79151153564453
14820/28840	The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though Franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single	50.385372161865234
14821/28840	The curtain rose and the attention of Franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the	55.454959869384766
14822/28840	Most of my readers are aware that the second act of _Parisina_ opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina while sleeping betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for U	56.234344482421875
14823/28840	The injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his	83.49256134033203
14824/28840	This duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Doniz	41.63203430175781
14825/28840	Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor Franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his	103.28785705566406
14826/28840	All doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at	151.83743286132812
14827/28840	Perhaps you never before noticed him   What a questionso truly French Do you not know that we Italians have eyes only for the man we love   True replied	81.16866302490234
14828/28840	How ghastly pale he is   Oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said	58.320003509521484
14829/28840	Then you know him almost screamed the count	100.30976104736328
14830/28840	Oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all aboutis he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what   I fancy I have seen him before and I even think he recognizes	77.92877960205078
14831/28840	And I can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget	35.038360595703125
14832/28840	The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and mis	130.48294067382812
14833/28840	This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before	42.25393295288086
14834/28840	I must positively find out who and what he is said Franz rising from his	66.7871322631836
14835/28840	No no cried the countess you must not leave	20.35223388671875
14836/28840	I depend upon you to escort me	50.76297378540039
14837/28840	Oh indeed I cannot permit you to	51.9253044128418
14838/28840	Is it possible whispered Franz that you entertain any fear   Ill tell you answered the count	47.053443908691406
14839/28840	Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen	62.578285217285156
14840/28840	The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before	144.54754638671875
14841/28840	Oh he is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect The coalblack hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burningthe same ghastly pal	64.3233871459961
14842/28840	Then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her	175.2366943359375
14843/28840	Nobody knows who she is or where she comes	162.69712829589844
14844/28840	No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical	143.4274444580078
14845/28840	I entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor	94.05439758300781
14846/28840	For that purpose I mean to keep you all to	171.97438049316406
14847/28840	Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many	189.92762756347656
14848/28840	Listen to me said the countess and do not be so very head	26.66820526123047
14849/28840	I have a party at my house tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the	47.79182052612305
14850/28840	Now I cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for	97.2366714477539
14851/28840	There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his	46.492095947265625
14852/28840	Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the	150.07376098632812
14853/28840	Upon arriving at her hotel Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the	62.120140075683594
14854/28840	Excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfreproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and I longed to be alone that I might compose my startled	49.72726058959961
14855/28840	Nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and I am sure it does not spring from your	35.840999603271484
14856/28840	What is it   Promise me I	48.35001754760742
14857/28840	I will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man	94.57418823242188
14858/28840	I have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is	34.26705551147461
14859/28840	Where he comes from I am ignorant but I can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least	40.39748001098633
14860/28840	Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said	115.93485260009766
14861/28840	Well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man	34.56520080566406
14862/28840	There are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet	434.3153991699219
14863/28840	For heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and	91.83625030517578
14864/28840	Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of	104.86849975585938
14865/28840	And now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this	67.4483642578125
14866/28840	For my own part I am quite sure I shall not be able to close my	21.059024810791016
14867/28840	So saying the countess quitted Franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were	56.979644775390625
14868/28840	Upon his return to the hotel Franz found Albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a	40.00907897949219
14869/28840	My dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you Why I did not expect to see you before	52.37849426269531
14870/28840	My dear Albert replied Franz I am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning Italian	54.838768005371094
14871/28840	I should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this	41.1964111328125
14872/28840	Upon my soul these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them ar	242.44076538085938
14873/28840	Why herethey give you their handthey press yours in returnthey keep up a whispering conversationpermit you to accompany them	151.91253662109375
14874/28840	Why if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone	151.77503967285156
14875/28840	And the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the _si_ as Dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to	79.255126953125
14876/28840	Besides you must have perceived that the countess was really	29.28896713256836
14877/28840	I can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced finelooking fellowadmirably	27.2056941986084
14878/28840	Indeed I feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a firstrate Paris tailorprobably Blin or Hum	79.07023620605469
14879/28840	He was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished	82.48199462890625
14880/28840	Franz smiled for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own	202.78334045410156
14881/28840	Well that tends to confirm my own ideas said Franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and	77.94873809814453
14882/28840	Did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words   I did but they were uttered in the Romaic	58.59800338745117
14883/28840	I knew that from the mixture of Greek	156.98382568359375
14884/28840	I dont know whether I ever told you that when I was at college I was ratherrather strong in	28.428470611572266
14885/28840	He spoke the Romaic language did he   I think	93.24017333984375
14886/28840	What do you say   Nothing	21.005104064941406
14887/28840	But tell me what were you thinking about when I came in   Oh I was arranging a little surprise for	29.614517211914062
14888/28840	Of what nature   Why you know it is quite impossible to procure a	39.75481033325195
14889/28840	Certainly and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get	54.38541030883789
14890/28840	Now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my	226.53106689453125
14891/28840	Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his	39.546043395996094
14892/28840	Franz cried Albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just	61.35854721069336
14893/28840	And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you	64.68953704833984
14894/28840	You agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question   I	64.58647918701172
14895/28840	Neither can we procure horses   True we have offered any sum but have	241.68186950683594
14896/28840	Well now what do you say to a cart I dare say such a thing might be	49.09115982055664
14897/28840	And a pair of oxen   As easily found as the	92.12845611572266
14898/28840	Then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be	61.56035232543945
14899/28840	The cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by Léopold	52.37518310546875
14900/28840	It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrent	60.30766296386719
14901/28840	Our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a	75.23454284667969
14902/28840	Albert I am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital	63.158958435058594
14903/28840	And quite a national one too replied Albert with gratified	215.79298400878906
14904/28840	A mere masque borrowed from our own	81.46206665039062
14905/28840	Ha ha ye Romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly	113.78114318847656
14906/28840	But you dont know us when we cant have one thing we invent	84.59259033203125
14907/28840	And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody   Only to our	110.23482513427734
14908/28840	Upon my return home I sent for him and I then explained to him what I wished to	43.02677917480469
14909/28840	He assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all I	91.8349838256836
14910/28840	One thing I was sorry for when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superflu	62.476287841796875
14911/28840	And where is he now   Who   Our	31.6380558013916
14912/28840	Gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too	101.05963134765625
14913/28840	Then he will be able to give us an answer	40.265907287597656
14914/28840	At this instant the door opened and the head of Signor Pastrini	14.254019737243652
14915/28840	Now then asked Albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen   Better than that replied Signor Pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with	44.919864654541016
14916/28840	Take care my worthy host said Albert _better_ is a sure enemy to _well	121.52458190917969
14917/28840	Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self	16.142873764038086
14918/28840	But what _have_ you done asked	130.1786651611328
14919/28840	When then the Count of Monte Cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the Palazzo Rosp	25.676542282104492
14920/28840	The friends looked at each other with unutterable	13.033174514770508
14921/28840	But do you think asked Albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger   What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo asked Franz of his	29.551904678344727
14922/28840	A very great nobleman but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot exactly say but this I know that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold	74.95574188232422
14923/28840	He would have writtenor   At this instant someone knocked at the	29.236291885375977
14924/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive	36.33306121826172
14925/28840	Faith Franz whispered Albert there is not much to find fault with	99.44992065429688
14926/28840	Tell the count replied Franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on	31.97764778137207
14927/28840	That is what I call an elegant mode of attack said Albert You were quite correct in what you said Signor Pastr	56.89873504638672
14928/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo is unquestionably a man of firstrate breeding and knowledge of the	13.276001930236816
14929/28840	Then you accept his offer said the	230.3892364501953
14930/28840	What say you Franz   Oh I agree with you the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided	50.70698928833008
14931/28840	Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would	92.88826751708984
14932/28840	The next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and wouldbe friend the Count of Monte Cristo possessed the ring of Gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this	70.13406372070312
14933/28840	Eight oclock found Franz up and dressed while Albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly	106.32516479492188
14934/28840	The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequious	47.772403717041016
14935/28840	Pray Signor Pastrini asked Franz is not some execution appointed to take place today   Yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too	53.12177276611328
14936/28840	Very possibly I may not go answered Franz but in case I feel disposed give me some particulars of todays	98.28955841064453
14937/28840	What particulars would your excellency like to hear   Why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to	56.10936737060547
14938/28840	That happens just lucky your excellency Only a few minutes ago they brought me the _tavolettas	52.58502960205078
14939/28840	What are they   Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of	62.77215576171875
14940/28840	The reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere	70.07322692871094
14941/28840	And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked Franz somewhat incred	103.13298034667969
14942/28840	Upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part Signor Pastrini cried	29.513952255249023
14943/28840	Why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor	35.026145935058594
14944/28840	I see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I	49.120426177978516
14945/28840	Meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these _tavolettas	20.90166473388672
14946/28840	Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber I have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your	29.37704849243164
14947/28840	John Lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit Luigi Vampa and his	22.46527862548828
14948/28840	The firstnamed malefactor will be _mazzolato_ the second culprit _decapitato	19.755168914794922
14949/28840	The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their	64.50623321533203
14950/28840	This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the Colosse	23.50112533569336
14951/28840	No part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous	72.06158447265625
14952/28840	Time was getting on however and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the	67.24646759033203
14953/28840	The anticipated delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual	70.16102600097656
14954/28840	Now my excellent Signor Pastrini said Franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo   Most assuredly replied	17.393569946289062
14955/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early riser and I can answer for his having been up these two	34.23905563354492
14956/28840	Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly   20155m       Oh I am quite	16.00786018371582
14957/28840	I will take all the blame on myself if you find I have led you into an	57.19019317626953
14958/28840	Well then if it be so are you ready Albert   Perfect	42.80248260498047
14959/28840	Let us go and return our best thanks for his	113.30534362792969
14960/28840	The landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said   _I signori Francesi	39.283607482910156
14961/28840	The domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to	75.56189727783203
14962/28840	They passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fittedup drawing	38.37321472167969
14963/28840	The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easychairs and sofas offered their highpiled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refresh	77.87242889404297
14964/28840	Splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the	48.82637405395508
14965/28840	If your excellencies will please to be seated said the man I will let the count know that you are	32.33870315551758
14966/28840	And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried _portières	24.900850296020508
14967/28840	As the door opened the sound of a _guzla_ reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to	48.19701385498047
14968/28840	Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the	24.623916625976562
14969/28840	Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid	139.68951416015625
14970/28840	Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times count returned Albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached	56.80986404418945
14971/28840	Indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit	19.945011138916016
14972/28840	It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini that I did not sooner assist you in your	39.745849609375
14973/28840	He did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as I am I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my	56.4737434387207
14974/28840	As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my	93.947265625
14975/28840	He resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the	51.35443115234375
14976/28840	Moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the count had no hold on Franz who had nothing to	58.173301696777344
14977/28840	However he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his	91.66549682617188
14978/28840	Count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the Rospoli	25.99041748046875
14979/28840	Stay I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps I can render you this slight service	93.41657257080078
14980/28840	He extended his hand and rang the bell thr	41.36030197143555
14981/28840	Did you ever occupy yourself said he to Franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants I	55.933753967285156
14982/28840	When I ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my stewardthus I do not waste a minute or a	51.59425735473633
14983/28840	A man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize	58.42516326904297
14984/28840	It was evident he had his	66.02840423583984
14985/28840	Monsieur Bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo as I ordered you	15.537882804870605
14986/28840	Yes excellency returned the steward but it was very	14.756937026977539
14987/28840	Did I not tell you I wished for one replied the count frown	38.6036376953125
14988/28840	And your excellency has one which was let to Prince Lobanieff but I was obliged to pay a hundred   That will dothat will do Monsieur Bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic	48.197505950927734
14989/28840	You have the window that is	280.5867004394531
14990/28840	Give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to	32.61563491821289
14991/28840	The steward bowed and was about to quit the	23.071081161499023
14992/28840	Ah continued the count be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the _tavoletta_ and if he can send us an account of the	26.38391876220703
14993/28840	There is no need to do that said Franz taking out his tablets for I saw the account and copied it	83.59162902832031
14994/28840	Let us know when breakfast is	302.2544860839844
14995/28840	These gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will I trust do me the honor to breakfast with me   But my dear count said Albert we shall abuse your	24.67795753479004
14996/28840	Not at all on the contrary you will give me great	19.354909896850586
14997/28840	You will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at	109.92697143554688
14998/28840	He then took Franzs tablets out of his	47.64224624633789
14999/28840	John Lateran and Peppino called Rocca Priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa and the men of his	18.744436264038086
15000/28840	Hum The first will be _mazzolato_ the second _decapitato	18.260644912719727
15001/28840	Yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the	39.99361038208008
15002/28840	Yes I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two	40.54844665527344
15003/28840	No replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for Peppino called Rocca Pri	25.048965454101562
15004/28840	You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the _mazzolata_ still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very	39.57642364501953
15005/28840	The _mandaïa_6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the suff	69.52691650390625
15006/28840	Ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of European punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of	39.888328552246094
15007/28840	Really count replied Franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the	35.2362060546875
15008/28840	There are at least few that I have not seen said the count cold	41.16512680053711
15009/28840	And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles   My first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third	155.39813232421875
15010/28840	I do not quite understand you replied Franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest	57.46513366699219
15011/28840	Listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any	68.31840515136719
15012/28840	I will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by	116.4458999633789
15013/28840	And remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the	65.61194610595703
15014/28840	No no continued the count had I to avenge myself it is not thus I would take	56.009925842285156
15015/28840	Then you disapprove of duelling You would not fight a duel asked Albert in his turn astonished at this strange	77.83586883544922
15016/28840	But said Franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the	42.995635986328125
15017/28840	Hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter dra	198.96302795410156
15018/28840	As he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying   _Al suo commodo_   The two young men arose and entered the breakfast	29.933063507080078
15019/28840	As for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate	86.64634704589844
15020/28840	This brought back to Franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the Countess G and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a	27.805681228637695
15021/28840	At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his	63.094482421875
15022/28840	Well said the count what are you doing   You must excuse us count returned Franz but we have still much to	14.392106056213379
15023/28840	What may that be   We have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure	38.763423919677734
15024/28840	Do not concern yourself about that we have I think a private room in the Piazza del Popolo I will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress	59.816490173339844
15025/28840	Opposite the scaffold   The scaffold forms part of the _fête	34.07827377319336
15026/28840	But I warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the	63.099082946777344
15027/28840	You will describe it to me replied Franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed	44.58201599121094
15028/28840	Besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see	63.55074691772461
15029/28840	_Diable_ when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a	52.48099899291992
15030/28840	If you went to Spain would you not see the bullfights Well suppose it is a bullfight you are going to see Recollect the ancient Romans of the Circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred	45.58446502685547
15031/28840	Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said Come despatch the	71.61312103271484
15032/28840	Shall you go then Albert asked	60.08354568481445
15033/28840	_Ma foi_ yes like you I hesitated but the counts eloquence decides	45.21513748168945
15034/28840	Let us go then said Franz since you wish it but on our way to the Piazza del Popolo I wish to pass through the Cor	19.78276824951172
15035/28840	Is this possible count   On foot yes in a carriage	212.86550903320312
15036/28840	Is it important that you should go that way   Yes there is something I wish to	27.437891006469727
15037/28840	Well we will go by the Cor	19.622581481933594
15038/28840	We will send the carriage to wait for us on the Piazza del Popolo by the Via del Babuino for I shall be glad to pass myself through the Corso to see if some orders I have given have been	22.498735427856445
15039/28840	Excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to	35.6523323059082
15040/28840	Ah yes returned the count I know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon you will find good cigars on the centre	62.93255615234375
15041/28840	The young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another	53.25312042236328
15042/28840	Albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Café de Paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros	33.6229362487793
15043/28840	Such was Alberts opinion of the count and as Franz well knew that Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change	76.27584075927734
15044/28840	But said he did you observe one very singular thing   What   How attentively he looked at	51.45647430419922
15045/28840	Ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising I have been more than a year absent from Paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a	67.35602569580078
15046/28840	The first opportunity you have undeceive him I beg and tell him I am nothing of the	54.94736862182617
15047/28840	Franz smiled an instant after the count	345.1742858886719
15048/28840	I am now quite at your service gentlemen said	37.39829635620117
15049/28840	The carriage is going one way to the Piazza del Popolo and we will go another and if you please by the Cor	22.47772216796875
15050/28840	Take some more of these cigars	395.7614440917969
15051/28840	With all my heart returned Albert Italian cigars are	244.67642211914062
15052/28840	When you come to Paris I will return all	47.647464752197266
15053/28840	I will not refuse I intend going there soon and since you allow me I will pay you a	57.53017044067383
15054/28840	Come we have not any time to lose it is halfpast twelvelet us set	28.946008682250977
15055/28840	All three descended the coachman received his masters orders and drove down the Via del Babu	26.419893264770508
15056/28840	Which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could	45.512107849121094
15057/28840	The three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was	68.6201171875
15058/28840	Franz glanced rapidly towards the three	152.09954833984375
15059/28840	The side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red	25.889583587646484
15060/28840	The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the	22.95174217224121
15061/28840	Preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with	65.41246032714844
15062/28840	The masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the	42.838783264160156
15063/28840	Franz Albert and the count continued to descend the Cor	59.19565963745117
15064/28840	At the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his	32.536094665527344
15065/28840	The window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the Via del Babuino and the Monte Pinc	33.979957580566406
15066/28840	It consisted as we have said of a small dressingroom opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite	57.346553802490234
15067/28840	On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white sat	60.566654205322266
15068/28840	Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the	42.2153434753418
15069/28840	It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotinewe say guillotine because the Roman _mandaïa_ is formed on almost the same model as the French	38.9582405090332
15070/28840	7 The knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the	92.1788558959961
15071/28840	Two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the	131.7950439453125
15072/28840	Their repast consisted apparently of bread and saus	83.36886596679688
15073/28840	One of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his	72.51499938964844
15074/28840	These two men were the executioners	94.88957977294922
15075/28840	At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his	40.86460494995117
15076/28840	A double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred	37.73196029663086
15077/28840	All the rest of the square was paved with	72.4402847290039
15078/28840	Many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best	88.75679016113281
15079/28840	What the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of	68.64630126953125
15080/28840	And yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the	85.54363250732422
15081/28840	It was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the	30.981674194335938
15082/28840	Suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church	64.02426147460938
15083/28840	A brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the	75.99626159667969
15084/28840	20169m       Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and	24.920236587524414
15085/28840	He was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge	69.1800765991211
15086/28840	He had moreover sandals bound on his feet by	269.5802307128906
15087/28840	Behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first Peppino and then	53.79572296142578
15088/28840	Peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited	76.74684143066406
15089/28840	Each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to	59.313961029052734
15090/28840	At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under	156.69224548339844
15091/28840	He looked at Alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked	88.32791137695312
15092/28840	The count alone seemed unmovednay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale	73.6529769897461
15093/28840	His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jack	34.148433685302734
15094/28840	And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as Franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and	73.39960479736328
15095/28840	However the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became	64.5137710571289
15096/28840	Peppino was a handsome young man of four or fiveandtwenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would	37.795265197753906
15097/28840	Andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be	256.6264953613281
15098/28840	In prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and	79.78951263427734
15099/28840	I thought said Franz to the count that you told me there would be but one	32.488136291503906
15100/28840	I told you true replied he cold	106.64088439941406
15101/28840	Yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to	49.97030258178711
15102/28840	If the pardon is to come there is no time to	56.25529098510742
15103/28840	And see here it is said the	33.14527130126953
15104/28840	At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_ a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded	29.867229461669922
15105/28840	The piercing eye of Peppino had noticed	87.23037719726562
15106/28840	A pardon for Peppino called Rocca Priori said the principal fri	20.266525268554688
15107/28840	And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to	34.12377166748047
15108/28840	For Peppino cried Andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been	42.56660461425781
15109/28840	Why for him and not for me We ought to die	75.00723266601562
15110/28840	I was promised he should die with	80.85313415527344
15111/28840	You have no right to put me to death	76.63838195800781
15112/28840	I will not die aloneI will not   And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his	44.67145538330078
15113/28840	The executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized	27.85638999938965
15114/28840	What is going on asked Franz of the count for as all the talk was in the Roman dialect he had not perfectly understood	48.05754089355469
15115/28840	Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward it is true but he was about to die without	42.676944732666016
15116/28840	Honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation   And the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to	52.46411895751953
15117/28840	However the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to	252.34278869628906

15134/28840	In fact said Franz this horrible scene has passed away like a	64.55128479003906
15135/28840	It is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed	73.7462158203125

15139/28840	Well Albert said Franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels Come answer	79.37611389160156
15140/28840	But I am really glad to have seen such a sight and I understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any	48.170204162597656

15164/28840	Franz thanked the count for his	287.0455017089844
15165/28840	As for Albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near	51.548912048339844

15168/28840	Well I am convinced they are all charming	99.55620574951172
15169/28840	How unfortunate that you were masked Albert said Franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappoint	82.3671875
15170/28840	Oh replied he half laughing half serious I hope the Carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the	87.94937133789062
15171/28840	But in spite of Alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman	27.599605560302734
15172/28840	At one of these encounters accidentally or purposely Alberts mask fell	53.633644104003906

15174/28840	Doubtless one of the charming females Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of vio	62.86483383178711
15175/28840	Albert seized it and as Franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered Albert to retain	67.25025177001953
15176/28840	Albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly	58.13993835449219

15181/28840	The jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_ the one who had thrown the violets to Albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button	42.715187072753906

15186/28840	Albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring	103.39942169189453
15187/28840	Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had	21.25191879272461

15191/28840	Signor Pastrini came to the door to receive his	41.17514419555664
15192/28840	The count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the	48.6422233581543
15193/28840	Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if Signor Pastrini could procure him a	56.48960494995117

15197/28840	The host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their	64.52490997314453

15199/28840	The two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristos table and that of Signor Pastr	14.852346420288086
15200/28840	Truth compelled Franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on Pastrinis	40.484954833984375
15201/28840	During dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the	213.85726928710938

15231/28840	The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace  	29.36563491821289

15238/28840	This morning he made two or three exits worthy of Didier or	140.4472198486328

15253/28840	The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastr	37.66033172607422

15256/28840	The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with	83.30039978027344
15257/28840	At halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of Franz and	44.510284423828125

15265/28840	On his return from the Vatican Franz carefully avoided the Corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profan	60.861488342285156

15270/28840	He had made up his mind to write to her the next	28.31584930419922
15271/28840	Franz remarked while he gave these details that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask	65.97392272949219
15272/28840	He insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other	102.0927963256836
15273/28840	Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next	81.2858657836914
15274/28840	Albert attributed to Franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her	115.14552307128906
15275/28840	Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his	68.81885528564453
15276/28840	He therefore promised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival from the windows of the Rospoli	36.89311218261719
15277/28840	The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous ep	54.82114791870117
15278/28840	This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored sat	37.31588363647461

15289/28840	I think so also replied Albert and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Braccianos	23.574695587158203
15290/28840	Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman	129.7755584716797

15303/28840	Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was	99.86143493652344
15304/28840	Alberts love had not taken away his	126.86377716064453

15307/28840	They had not seen him for two	40.597171783447266
15308/28840	Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecch	41.27947998046875
15309/28840	He had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour	52.35530471801758
15310/28840	Whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody	76.77437591552734
15311/28840	The man was an enigma to	40.64112854003906
15312/28840	The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between	57.34059524536133
15313/28840	On his side however great Franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning	57.30082702636719
15314/28840	The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre and were told they were all	36.4964485168457
15315/28840	In consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his	102.79558563232422
15316/28840	Franz and Albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the Palli Theatre the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by	38.52751541137695
15317/28840	This assurance determined the two friends to accept	200.0220489501953
15318/28840	Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first	67.69947052001953
15319/28840	He could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pall	40.9179573059082
15320/28840	Truly a Byronic hero Franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon Manfreds shoulders or beneath Laras	156.52645874023438
15321/28840	He was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at	38.588233947753906

15325/28840	He thought several times of the project the count had of visiting Paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect	57.97068786621094
15326/28840	And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when the count was	28.8760986328125

15332/28840	On Tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as Lent begins after eight at	58.909568786621094

15336/28840	Albert was triumphant in his harlequin	52.140987396240234
15337/28840	A knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the	25.188194274902344
15338/28840	In order that there might be no confusion Franz wore his peasants	114.4137191772461

15343/28840	The races like the _moccoli_ are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the	20.5842342376709
15344/28840	At the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent	71.61968231201172
15345/28840	All these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the	38.818092346191406

15347/28840	A detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the _barberi	40.88307189941406
15348/28840	When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was	27.281591415405273

15351/28840	Immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the Corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite	101.87847900390625
15352/28840	A new source of noise and movement was added to the	235.04385375976562
15353/28840	The sellers of _moccoletti_ entered on the	28.68077278137207

15356/28840	The _moccoletto_ is kindled by approaching it to a	35.47278594970703

15358/28840	Everyone hastened to purchase _moccoletti_Franz and Albert among the	23.376750946044922
15359/28840	The night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of _Moccoletti_ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the	36.8199577331543

15366/28840	This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the Corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were	86.59893035888672

15368/28840	The two friends were in the Via dei Pontef	31.379493713378906
15369/28840	Albert sprang out bearing his _moccoletto_ in his	24.567873001098633
15370/28840	Two or three masks strove to knock his _moccoletto_ out of his hand but Albert a firstrate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of San Giac	37.06389236450195
15371/28840	The steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each others	81.17891693115234
15372/28840	Franz followed Albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first	66.01643371582031
15373/28840	Instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any	37.63438034057617
15374/28840	Franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw Albert disappear arminarm with the peasant	165.842041015625
15375/28840	He watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the Via Mace	24.73491859436035
15376/28840	Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival sounded and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished as if by	21.796916961669922
15377/28840	It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished	87.24542999267578

15380/28840	It seemed as though Rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast	85.89826965332031
15381/28840	By a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest	49.00066375732422
15382/28840	The distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the Hôtel de Lond	24.18555450439453
15383/28840	Dinner was waiting but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon Franz sat down without	86.12995910644531
15384/28840	Signor Pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had	43.234161376953125
15385/28840	The sudden extinction of the _moccoletti_ the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in Franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneas	29.189334869384766
15386/28840	He therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted	45.26630401611328
15387/28840	Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as	202.80587768554688
15388/28840	He ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the	23.137279510498047
15389/28840	At eleven oclock Albert had not come	44.49659729003906
15390/28840	Franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of Braccian	30.68084716796875
15391/28840	Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling	76.9167251586914
15392/28840	Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the _moccoli_ and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Mace	16.535186767578125
15393/28840	Then he has not returned said the d	41.174957275390625

15399/28840	You should not have allowed him to go said the duke to Franz you who know Rome better than he	49.02745819091797
15400/28840	Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquiet	60.34552001953125
15401/28840	I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night here duke said Franz and desired them to come and inform me of his	39.88887023925781

15415/28840	He had no doubt that it was the messenger from	73.2164306640625
15416/28840	The man was wrapped up in a large	21.228923797607422
15417/28840	He went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed	39.140010833740234
15418/28840	What wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his	61.48841857910156
15419/28840	Are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired Franz from the Viscount of Morcerf   Your excellency lodges at Pastrinis hotel   I	16.975557327270508
15420/28840	Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount   I	21.93130874633789
15421/28840	Your excellencys name   Is the Baron Franz dÉpin	12.753459930419922
15422/28840	20199m       Then it is to your excellency that this letter is	13.408880233764648
15423/28840	Is there any answer inquired Franz taking the letter from	65.29092407226562
15424/28840	Come upstairs with me and I will give it to	24.747400283813477
15425/28840	I prefer waiting here said the messenger with a	32.369293212890625
15426/28840	And why   Your excellency will know when you have read the	18.57171058654785
15427/28840	Shall I find you here then  	47.227394104003906
15428/28840	On the staircase he met Signor Pastr	26.725242614746094
15429/28840	You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of	61.81334686279297
15430/28840	Yes I have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to	23.8947696685791
15431/28840	Light the candles in my apartment if you	125.80738830566406
15432/28840	The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a	50.51130294799805
15433/28840	The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read Alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded	38.04079055786133
15434/28840	It was written and signed by	97.95329284667969
15435/28840	Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it	289.9425964355469
15436/28840	Run to Torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the	42.31776809692383
15437/28840	It is urgent that I should have this money without	80.25699615478516
15438/28840	I do not say more relying on you as you may rely on	17.808427810668945
15439/28840	Your friend   Albert de Morcer	21.19015884399414
15440/28840	_If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven oclock the Count Albert will have ceased to live	62.76409912109375
15441/28840	This second signature explained everything to Franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for	91.16834259033203
15442/28840	Albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to	35.140625
15443/28840	He hastened to open the _secrétaire_ and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in it the letter of	31.164125442504883
15444/28840	There were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand Albert had already expended three	77.96540069580078
15445/28840	As to Franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at Florence and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty	40.925899505615234
15446/28840	Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert	30.22843360900879
15447/28840	True he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor Torl	33.42097473144531
15448/28840	He was therefore about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his	19.24077033996582
15449/28840	He remembered the Count of Monte Crist	10.266523361206055
15450/28840	Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini when that worthy presented	78.47904205322266
15451/28840	My dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within   Yes your excellency he has this moment	28.276111602783203
15452/28840	Is he in bed   I should say	69.10846710205078
15453/28840	Then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an	41.19346618652344
15454/28840	Signor Pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said   The count awaits your excell	39.25052261352539
15455/28840	Franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the	52.713844299316406
15456/28840	He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with div	32.13068389892578
15457/28840	Well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me It would be very kind of	56.793941497802734
15458/28840	No I have come to speak to you of a very serious	18.11799430847168
15459/28840	A serious matter said the count looking at Franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be   Are we alone   Yes replied the count going to the door and	30.469242095947266
15460/28840	Did you see the postscript   I did	27.911636352539062
15461/28840	_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte Alberto avrà cessato di vive	24.458507537841797
15462/28840	What think you of that inquired	140.46665954589844
15463/28840	Have you the money he demands   Yes all but eight hundred piast	53.30882263183594
15464/28840	The count went to his _secrétaire_ opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to Franz I hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but	26.719860076904297
15465/28840	You see on the contrary I come to you first and instantly replied	61.216373443603516
15466/28840	And I thank you have what you will and he made a sign to Franz to take what he	55.23651885986328
15467/28840	Is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to Luigi Vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the	29.76701545715332
15468/28840	I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said	31.897031784057617
15469/28840	How so returned the count with	79.72315216064453
15470/28840	If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa I am sure he would not refuse you Alberts	41.44693374633789
15471/28840	The count knit his brows and remained silent an	32.76645278930664
15472/28840	And if I went to seek Vampa would you accompany me   If my society would not be disagree	55.3514518737793
15473/28840	It is a lovely night and a walk without Rome will do us both	129.58566284179688
15474/28840	Shall I take any arms   For what purpose   Any money   It is	31.89373207092285
15475/28840	Where is the man who brought the letter   In the	31.785383224487305
15476/28840	He awaits the answer  	94.28106689453125
15477/28840	I must learn where we are	32.52149963378906
15478/28840	It is useless he would not come	87.72545623779297
15479/28840	To your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering	102.13744354248047
15480/28840	The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar	39.39488220214844
15481/28840	The man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the	20.351192474365234
15482/28840	_Salite_ said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his	55.495880126953125
15483/28840	The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the	55.58828353881836
15484/28840	Ah it is you Peppino said the	18.703847885131836
15485/28840	But Peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts hand and covered it with	19.070920944213867
15486/28840	Ah said the count you have then not forgotten that I saved your life that is strange for it is a week	32.676780700683594
15487/28840	20203m       No excellency and never shall I forget it returned Peppino with an accent of profound	18.055572509765625
15488/28840	Never That is a long time but it is something that you believe	42.30708694458008
15489/28840	Oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my	28.343406677246094
15490/28840	You allow me to give you this title continued the count in French it is necessary to excite this mans	43.58778381347656
15491/28840	You can speak before me said Franz I am a friend of the	40.59571838378906
15492/28840	I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to	34.366695404052734
15493/28840	How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigis hands   Excellency the Frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was	39.50630569458008
15494/28840	The Frenchman threw her a bouquet Teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the	123.97569274902344
15495/28840	What cried Franz was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants   It was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied Pepp	32.80838394165039
15496/28840	Well then the Frenchman took off his mask Teresa with the chiefs consent did the	104.82109832763672
15497/28840	The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous Teresa gave him oneonly instead of Teresa it was Beppo who was on the steps of the church of San Giac	44.30867004394531
15498/28840	What exclaimed Franz the peasant girl who snatched his _mocoletto_ from him   Was a lad of fifteen replied Pepp	48.421138763427734
15499/28840	But it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived Beppo has taken in plenty of	69.21786499023438
15500/28840	And Beppo led him outside the walls said the	90.09988403320312
15501/28840	Exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Mace	22.883026123046875
15502/28840	Beppo got in inviting the Frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked	108.25363159179688
15503/28840	He gallantly offered the righthand seat to Beppo and sat by	102.85771179199219
15504/28840	Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from Rome the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the	44.060081481933594
15505/28840	The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the	34.95326232910156
15506/28840	At the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the Almo surrounded the	60.077125549316406
15507/28840	The Frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled Beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to	64.56771850585938
15508/28840	They made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to Teresa and Luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of	24.503583908081055
15509/28840	Well said the count turning towards Franz it seems to me that this is a very likely	11.9519681930542
15510/28840	What do you say to it   Why that I should think it very amusing replied Franz if it had happened to anyone but poor	24.63819122314453
15511/28840	And in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious	73.11619567871094
15512/28840	And shall we go and find him inquired	61.09783172607422
15513/28840	He is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of	40.89372253417969
15514/28840	Sebastian   I was never in them but I have often resolved to visit	90.472412109375
15515/28840	Well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a	42.86684036254883
15516/28840	Have you a carriage  	38.34230041503906
15517/28840	That is of no consequence I always have one ready day and	130.9789581298828
15518/28840	I am a very capricious being and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night I resolve on starting for some particular point and away I	60.48838424682617
15519/28840	The count rang and a footman	77.33003997802734
15520/28840	Order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the hol	52.63982009887695
15521/28840	You need not awaken the coachman Ali will	175.18682861328125
15522/28840	In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the	12.64807415008545
15523/28840	We might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infid	53.45941925048828
15524/28840	Are you still resolved to accompany me   More determined than	42.37874221801758
15525/28840	Franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by Pepp	40.59353256225586
15526/28840	At the door they found the	59.78273010253906
15527/28840	Ali was on the box in whom Franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Crist	33.70882034301758
15528/28840	Franz and the count got into the	39.35132598876953
15529/28840	Peppino placed himself beside Ali and they set off at a rapid	60.34779357910156
15530/28840	Ali had received his instructions and went down the Corso crossed the Campo Vaccino went up the Strada San Gregorio and reached the gates of	23.757810592651367
15531/28840	The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way and bordered with tom	50.895755767822266
15532/28840	From time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Pepp	44.622650146484375
15533/28840	A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage stopped Peppino opened the door and the count and Franz alight	30.61482810974121
15534/28840	In ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be	26.76637840270996
15535/28840	He then took Peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and Peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the	30.99547576904297
15536/28840	Five minutes elapsed during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous	60.13401794433594
15537/28840	Now said the count let us follow	23.608736038208008
15538/28840	Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small	31.906282424926758
15539/28840	They then perceived two men conversing in the	56.48472595214844
15540/28840	Ought we to go on asked Franz of the count or should we pause   Let us go on Peppino will have warned the sentry of our	66.00664520263672
15541/28840	One of the two men was Peppino and the other a bandit on the	24.228307723999023
15542/28840	Franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted	64.25227355957031
15543/28840	Your excellency said Peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at	39.09370040893555
15544/28840	They came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely	25.72957420349121
15545/28840	Peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage	57.16017532348633
15546/28840	Peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after	60.96724319458008
15547/28840	The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him	145.8850555419922
15548/28840	The passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one	82.09342193603516
15549/28840	They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by Who comes there At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine	35.29021072387695
15550/28840	A friend responded Peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might	36.882652282714844
15551/28840	Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty	90.38720703125
15552/28840	Franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary	71.66682434082031
15553/28840	Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catac	49.457054138183594
15554/28840	Down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were	57.26124954223633
15555/28840	The count laid his hand on Franzs	39.7420654296875
15556/28840	Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he	183.03558349609375
15557/28840	Peppino obeyed and Franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since Peppino had put out his torch was visible along the	43.59176254272461
15558/28840	They advanced silently the count guiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the	61.730926513671875
15559/28840	Franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a	103.14340209960938
15560/28840	Three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a	106.2476806640625
15561/28840	These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have	47.38414001464844
15562/28840	In the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted	88.06742095947266
15563/28840	A lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the	37.363243103027344
15564/28840	A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the newcomers contemplated	27.28096580505371
15565/28840	This was the chief of the band Luigi V	39.39777755737305
15566/28840	Around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within	62.575984954833984
15567/28840	At the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than	56.68123245239258
15568/28840	Who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamplight a shadow approaching his	52.92015838623047
15569/28840	At this challenge Vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his gird	40.75758743286133
15570/28840	In a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the	40.43040466308594
15571/28840	Well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear Vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of	32.7100944519043
15572/28840	It seems that your memory is equally short in everything Vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with	82.14432525634766
15573/28840	What conditions have I forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair	23.383384704589844
15574/28840	Why did you not tell me all thisyou inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his	42.4241943359375
15575/28840	Are you not alone asked Vampa with uneas	31.073461532592773
15576/28840	I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his	29.203960418701172
15577/28840	Come your excellency the count added turning to Franz here is Luigi Vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has	38.270076751708984
15578/28840	Franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet	137.97369384765625
15579/28840	Welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friends ransom that this had	64.90699768066406
15580/28840	But said Franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscountI do not see	26.571279525756836
15581/28840	Nothing has happened to him I hope said the count frown	31.845998764038086
15582/28840	The prisoner is there replied Vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and I will go myself and tell him he is	36.02890396118164
15583/28840	The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Alberts prison and Franz and the count followed	39.500492095947266
15584/28840	What is the prisoner doing inquired Vampa of the sent	40.39122009277344
15585/28840	_Ma foi_ captain replied the sentry I do not know for the last hour I have not heard him	29.597976684570312
15586/28840	The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a	43.301666259765625
15587/28840	Then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound sl	30.109527587890625
15588/28840	Come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow	20.41457176208496
15589/28840	Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of	30.0255184173584
15590/28840	You are right your excellency he said this must be one of your	22.57431411743164
15591/28840	Then going to Albert he touched him on the shoulder saying Will your excellency please to awaken   Albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his	26.82134246826172
15592/28840	Oh said he is it you captain You should have allowed me to	69.74234771728516
15593/28840	I was dancing the galop at Torlonias with the Countess	32.434539794921875
15594/28840	Then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time	42.15352249145508
15595/28840	Why the devil do you rouse me at this hour   To tell you that you are free your excell	16.437612533569336
15596/28840	My dear fellow replied Albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future Napoleons maxim Never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on I should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my	51.09044647216797
15597/28840	So then they have paid my ransom   No your excell	23.830486297607422
15598/28840	Well then how am I free   A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand	56.850894927978516
15599/28840	Really Then that person is a most amiable	144.58993530273438
15600/28840	What said he is it you my dear Franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed   No not I replied Franz but our neighbor the Count of Monte Crist	31.5740966796875
15601/28840	My dear Albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlon	31.313276290893555
15602/28840	You may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no illwill to Signor Luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a	94.69033813476562
15603/28840	You are decidedly right and we may reach the Palazzo by two o	46.637672424316406
15604/28840	Signor Luigi continued Albert is there any formality to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency   None sir replied the bandit you are as free as	54.63932418823242
15605/28840	Well then a happy and merry life to	134.8031768798828
15606/28840	And Albert followed by Franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in	48.471797943115234
15607/28840	Peppino said the brigand chief give me the	47.36455154418945
15608/28840	What are you going to do inquired the	12.151524543762207
15609/28840	I will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that I can render to your excell	30.15520668029785
15610/28840	And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes	40.955322265625
15611/28840	And now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has	21.571828842163086
15612/28840	No my dear Vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed	66.70947265625
15613/28840	20214m       Gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever I may be you shall be	32.6757926940918
15614/28840	The count went out first then	223.98757934570312
15615/28840	Has your excellency anything to ask me said Vampa with a	21.432558059692383
15616/28840	Yes I have replied Franz I am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we	49.68859100341797
15617/28840	Cæsars _Commentaries_ said the bandit it is my favorite	27.23320960998535
15618/28840	Yes replied Franz here I am and he in his turn left the	75.58888244628906
15619/28840	Ah your pardon said Albert turning round will you allow me captain   And he lighted his cigar at Vampas	43.184547424316406
15620/28840	Now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we	45.439388275146484
15621/28840	I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Braccian	21.483932495117188
15622/28840	They found the carriage where they had left	41.83325958251953
15623/28840	The count said a word in Arabic to Ali and the horses went on at great	103.0385513305664
15624/28840	It was just two oclock by Alberts watch when the two friends entered into the dancing	30.826480865478516
15625/28840	Their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on Alberts account ceased	104.5982666015625
15626/28840	And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of	40.822689056396484
15627/28840	In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to	35.32393264770508
15628/28840	My very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exert	41.4453239440918
15629/28840	I am wholly a stranger to Parisit is a city I have never yet	38.60856246948242
15630/28840	Is it possible exclaimed Albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world I can scarcely credit	70.26863098144531
15631/28840	So distinguished an individual as yourself cried Albert could scarcely have required an	263.9291687011719
15632/28840	You are most kind but as regards myself I can find no merit I possess save that as a millionaire I might have become a partner in the speculations of	51.39004898071289
15633/28840	Rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks I stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into	154.86553955078125
15634/28840	Your offer however smooths all difficulties and I have only to ask you my dear	67.144287109375
15635/28840	Connected by marriage you mean said Franz laugh	241.66551208496094
15636/28840	Well never mind how it is answered Albert it comes to the same thing in the	58.27738571166992
15637/28840	Then it is settled said the count and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long med	47.90513229370117
15638/28840	And in three months time said Albert you will be at my house   Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my	53.64580535888672
15639/28840	Day for day hour for hour said Albert that will suit me to a	118.24124908447266
15640/28840	So be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the 21st of February and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten o	22.017868041992188
15641/28840	Now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the fore	49.06586837768555
15642/28840	Capital exclaimed Albert your breakfast shall be	214.21212768554688
15643/28840	Where do you live  	27.90920066833496
15644/28840	Have you bachelors apartments there I hope my coming will not put you to any	110.51309204101562
15645/28840	I reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main	42.358795166015625
15646/28840	Quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down	157.230224609375
15647/28840	27 Rue du Helder 21st May halfpast ten in the	11.265114784240723
15648/28840	Now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than	63.47043228149414
15649/28840	Shall I see you again ere my departure asked	59.90531921386719
15650/28840	That depends when do you leave   Tomorrow evening at five o	74.19929504394531
15651/28840	In that case I must say adieu to you as I am compelled to go to Naples and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday	41.57647705078125
15652/28840	And you baron pursued the count addressing Franz do you also depart tomorrow  	36.51241683959961
15653/28840	For France   No for Venice I shall remain in Italy for another year or	72.35611724853516
15654/28840	Then we shall not meet in Paris   I fear I shall not have that	29.223739624023438
15655/28840	Well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant	51.52783966064453
15656/28840	It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a	37.7961540222168
15657/28840	20219m       Let us understand each other said Albert it is agreedis it notthat you are to be at	20.455406188964844
15658/28840	27 in the Rue du Helder on the 21st of May at halfpast ten in the morning and your word of honor passed for your punctuality   The 21st of May at halfpast ten in the morning Rue du Helder	11.961784362792969
15659/28840	The young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the	26.089923858642578
15660/28840	What is the matter asked Albert of Franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly	37.77291488647461
15661/28840	I will confess to you Albert replied Franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehens	24.876502990722656
15662/28840	My dear fellow exclaimed Albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness Why you must have lost your	57.443824768066406
15663/28840	Whether I am in my senses or not answered Franz that is the way I	46.306732177734375
15664/28840	Listen to me Franz said Albert I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to	54.852317810058594
15665/28840	Have you anything particular against him  	148.8816680908203
15666/28840	Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither   I	75.70352172851562
15667/28840	And where   Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you   I	15.713207244873047
15668/28840	Upon your honor   Upon my	66.5552749633789
15669/28840	Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two Corsican bandits with	33.03022766113281
15670/28840	He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the _Thousand and One Nights	20.881118774414062
15671/28840	Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum between the count and Vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully	42.780372619628906
15672/28840	Albert listened with the most profound	50.09109115600586
15673/28840	Well said he when Franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related The count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his	94.71815490722656
15674/28840	Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this	64.76561737060547
15675/28840	Still persisted Franz I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your	87.84191131591797
15676/28840	My dear Franz replied Albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger help me to deliver	58.06508255004883
15677/28840	Was not that nearly what you said   20222m       It	17.018014907836914
15678/28840	Well then did he ask you Who is	138.1287078857422
15679/28840	Albert de Morcerf how does he come by his namehis fortune what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native Tell me did he put all these questions to you   I confess he asked me	43.071529388427734
15680/28840	No he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa where I can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern I did not very particularly care to	35.86561965942383
15681/28840	And this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on Alberts	35.0499382019043
15682/28840	Well said Franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of ref	38.43479919433594
15683/28840	Still in spite of all you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular person	14.032171249389648
15684/28840	He is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and	91.0228271484375
15685/28840	If my vote and interest can obtain it for him I will readily give him the one and promise the	68.664794921875
15686/28840	And now my dear Franz let us talk of something	26.3192195892334
15687/28840	Come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to	42.46094512939453
15688/28840	Peters   Franz silently assented and the following afternoon at halfpast five oclock the young men	79.396484375
15689/28840	Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris and Franz dÉpinay to pass a fortnight at	19.86530303955078
15690/28840	The Guests   In the house in the Rue du Helder where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the	26.15353775024414
15691/28840	Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants	55.082889556884766
15692/28840	Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the	64.78903198242188
15693/28840	Between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcer	34.67011260986328
15694/28840	A high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage	73.6194076538086
15695/28840	A small door close to the lodge of the _concierge_ gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on	51.17356491088867
15696/28840	It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for	63.27853775024414
15697/28840	There were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded	49.26985168457031
15698/28840	By means of the two windows looking into the street Albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thorough	55.803348541259766
15699/28840	Then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the _concierges_ door and which merits a particular	56.53924560546875
15700/28840	It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the welloiled hinges and locks told quite another	85.85944366455078
15701/28840	At the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right Alberts breakfastroom looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the	29.815500259399414

15703/28840	On the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a	55.1080322265625
15704/28840	The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan for the use of	131.2532501220703
15705/28840	The boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been	42.50373840332031

15861/28840	Precisely asked Debray taking out his	196.99668884277344
15862/28840	Oh you will give me five minutes grace replied Morcerf for I also expect a pres	34.168060302734375
15863/28840	What shall we do said Debray we have only one Monthyon	20.027456283569336
15864/28840	Well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said Beauchamp that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the	23.966629028320312
15865/28840	And where does he come from asked Debr	20.642196655273438
15866/28840	You have already answered the question once but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second	92.1982421875
15867/28840	Really said Albert I do not know when I invited him three months ago he was then at Rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone   And you think him capable of being exact demanded Debr	34.59462356567383
15868/28840	Well with the five minutes grace we have only ten	72.90306854248047
15869/28840	I will profit by them to tell you something about my	58.69734191894531
15870/28840	I beg pardon interrupted Beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us   Yes and for a most curious	36.11005783081055
15871/28840	Go on then for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning and I must make up for	51.64356994628906
15872/28840	I was at Rome during the last	37.978843688964844
15873/28840	Yes but what you do not know is that I was carried off by	26.33435821533203
15874/28840	Yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for I found them ugly enough to frighten	97.58686065673828
15875/28840	Come my dear Albert said Debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes and that like Madame de Maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a	36.2608642578125
15876/28840	Say so at once we are sufficiently wellbred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to	74.19062805175781
15877/28840	And I say to you fabulous as it may seem I tell it as a true one from beginning to	79.6826400756836
15878/28840	The brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the Catacombs of Saint	33.820003509521484
15879/28840	I know it said ChâteauRenaud I narrowly escaped catching a fever	32.217864990234375
15880/28840	And I did more than that replied Morcerf for I caught	38.05127716064453
15881/28840	I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4000 Roman crownsabout 24000 franc	30.864810943603516
15882/28840	I was at the end of my journey and of my	27.571680068969727
15883/28840	But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns said ChâteauRen	22.550649642944336
15884/28840	A man whose name is Franz dÉpinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring	20.69220542907715
15885/28840	No he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to	72.86323547363281
15886/28840	Ah this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus a Perseus freeing	95.92166137695312
15887/28840	No he is a man about my own	39.90683364868164
15888/28840	Armed to the teeth   He had not even a knittingneed	90.22245788574219
15889/28840	But he paid your ransom   He said two words to the chief and I was	69.55872344970703
15890/28840	And they apologized to him for having carried you off said Beauch	49.24692916870117
15891/28840	No his name is the Count of Monte Crist	7.675086975097656
15892/28840	There is no Count of Monte Cristo said Debr	11.454912185668945
15893/28840	I do not think so added ChâteauRenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the European nobility	10.611618041992188
15894/28840	Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo   He comes possibly from the Holy Land and one of his ancestors possessed Calvary as the Mortemarts did the Dead	50.58446502685547
15895/28840	I think I can assist your researches said Maximil	22.745174407958984
15896/28840	Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employeda grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean an atom in the	58.28739547729492
15897/28840	Well he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in Tusc	82.44452667236328
15898/28840	He is rich then   I believe	21.166519165039062
15899/28840	Which means   Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those	20.501264572143555
15900/28840	He has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself Sinbad the Sailor and has a cave filled with	34.03171920776367
15901/28840	And you have seen this cavern Morcerf asked Beauch	23.376667022705078
15902/28840	No but Franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before	91.09129333496094
15903/28840	Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strump	74.51744842529297
15904/28840	Only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of	66.4814682006836
15905/28840	The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to sayAre you mad or are you laughing at us   And I also said Morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named Penel	29.643224716186523
15906/28840	Ah cried Albert it is very lucky that	35.48067855834961
15907/28840	Morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth   My dear Albert said Debray what you tell us is so	35.87974166870117
15908/28840	Ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of themthey have no	120.25995635986328
15909/28840	They are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who	66.09953308105469
15910/28840	Now you get angry and attack our poor	288.32318115234375
15911/28840	How will you have them protect you The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely	154.45851135253906
15912/28840	Will you be ambassador Albert I will send you to	132.26771545410156
15913/28840	No lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali the Sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle	93.8443374633789
15914/28840	Yes said Albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the Count of Monte Crist	11.892946243286133
15915/28840	Doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an Arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and Greek mist	108.4402847290039
15916/28840	Have you seen the Greek mistress   I have both seen and heard	51.32612991333008
15917/28840	I saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when I breakfasted with the	43.723350524902344
15918/28840	He eats then   Yes but so little it can hardly be called	125.04806518554688
15919/28840	Laugh if you will the Countess G who knew Lord Ruthven declared that the count was a	68.9952621459961
15920/28840	For a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous seaserpent of the _Constitutionnel	35.28516387939453
15921/28840	Wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said Debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexception	56.8780403137207
15922/28840	Just so Lucien returned Morcerf you have described him feature for	78.61686706542969
15923/28840	This man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution I thought I should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the	41.93989562988281
15924/28840	Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your blood asked Beauch	28.38843536376953
15925/28840	Or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birthright   Rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said Morcerf somewhat piqu	80.71246337890625
15926/28840	When I look at you Parisians idlers on the Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same	18.094058990478516
15927/28840	At the same time added ChâteauRenaud your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditt	19.2486629486084
15928/28840	There are no Italian banditti said Debr	48.50332260131836
15929/28840	No Count of Monte Cristo added Debr	9.821157455444336
15930/28840	20243m       Confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued Beauch	20.1240234375
15931/28840	But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced His excellency the Count of Monte Crist	19.30855369567871
15932/28840	The involuntary start everyone gave proved how much Morcerfs narrative had impressed them and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden	86.30311584472656
15933/28840	He had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiseless	34.747352600097656
15934/28840	The count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his	65.54205322265625
15935/28840	Every article of dresshat coat gloves and bootswas from the first	501.8629455566406
15936/28840	But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had	91.77059173583984
15937/28840	The count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached Albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial	30.85704803466797
15938/28840	Punctuality said Monte Cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns I think but it is not the same with	50.06669616699219
15939/28840	However I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in France where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postil	57.494956970214844
15940/28840	My dear count replied Albert I was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom I now present to	39.24129867553711
15941/28840	They are the Count of ChâteauRenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table	28.47774887084961
15942/28840	Lucien Debray private secretary to the minister of the interior	44.210514068603516
15943/28840	Beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the French government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in Italy since his paper is prohibited there and	72.40927124023438
15944/28840	At this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale	85.04322052001953
15945/28840	You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome	42.83442306518555
15946/28840	No one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he	77.83041381835938
15947/28840	You have never seen our Africans count said	77.30939483642578
15948/28840	Never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself	65.0864486694336
15949/28840	Well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole	50.801788330078125
15950/28840	And we have just heard continued Albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although I have seen him today for the first time I request you to allow me to introduce him as my	40.62516403198242
15951/28840	At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show	144.49778747558594
15952/28840	Ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the	17.77054786682129
15953/28840	This exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what Albert was saying surprised everybody and especially Morrel who looked at Monte Cristo with	59.53586196899414
15954/28840	But at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at	44.2043571472168
15955/28840	20245m       Why should he doubt it said Beauchamp to ChâteauRen	7.915518760681152
15956/28840	In reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in Monte Cristo Albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular	44.57356643676758
15957/28840	What say you Morrel   _Ma foi_ he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about	32.66843032836914
15958/28840	Gentlemen said Albert Germain informs me that breakfast is	337.52691650390625
15959/28840	My dear count allow me to show you the	27.20891761779785
15960/28840	They passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his	69.75548553466797
15961/28840	Gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may	88.63701629638672
15962/28840	I am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time I have ever been at	15.075651168823242
15963/28840	The French way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the Paris	65.13292694091797
15964/28840	I beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish too Italian or too	140.18983459472656
15965/28840	With what an air he says all this muttered Beauchamp decidedly he is a great	65.38114929199219
15966/28840	A great man in his own country added Debr	67.44672393798828
15967/28840	A great man in every country	525.6389770507812
15968/28840	The count was it may be remembered a most temperate	292.6563415527344
15969/28840	Albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential	90.61864471435547
15970/28840	My dear count said he I fear one thing and that is that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di Sp	18.496713638305664
15971/28840	I ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared	66.31641387939453
15972/28840	I eat everywhere and of everything only I eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for I have not eaten since yesterday	86.90545654296875
15973/28840	And you ate in your carriage asked Morcer	29.399351119995117
15974/28840	No I slept as I generally do when I am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to	68.12540435791016
15975/28840	But you can sleep when you please monsieur said Mor	18.567729949951172
15976/28840	You have a recipe for it   An infallible	48.40243911743164
15977/28840	That would be invaluable to us in Africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to	121.37245178222656
15978/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was	59.3968620300293
15979/28840	May we inquire what is this recipe asked Debr	46.04277420043945
15980/28840	Oh yes returned Monte Cristo I make no secret of	31.715377807617188
15981/28840	It is a mixture of excellent opium which I fetched myself from Canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the Eastthat is between the Tigris and the Euph	33.640682220458984
15982/28840	These two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into	178.5028533935547
15983/28840	Ten minutes after one is taken the effect is	196.71397399902344
15984/28840	Ask Baron Franz dÉpinay I think he tasted them one	47.2057991027832
15985/28840	Yes replied Morcerf he said something about it to	23.104156494140625
15986/28840	But said Beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you  	77.6810302734375
15987/28840	Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued Beauchamp hoping to take him at a	76.91442108154297
15988/28840	This ball had an acrid and penetrating	261.6044006347656
15989/28840	There were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a	69.59103393554688
15990/28840	The casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to	51.891021728515625
15991/28840	And is it your cook who prepares these pills asked Beauch	44.33195877075195
15992/28840	Oh no monsieur replied Monte Cristo I do not thus betray my enjoyments to the	28.6041316986084
15993/28840	I am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills	59.22476577758789
15994/28840	This is a magnificent emerald and the largest I have ever seen said ChâteauRenaud although my mother has some remarkable family	28.589855194091797
15995/28840	I had three similar ones returned Monte Crist	38.403507232666016
15996/28840	I gave one to the Sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the Pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor Pius	144.8539581298828
15997/28840	I kept the third for myself and I had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I	101.8722152709961
15998/28840	Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was	16.029251098632812
15999/28840	However the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former	58.985008239746094
16000/28840	And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked Debr	64.14665222167969
16001/28840	The Sultan the liberty of a woman replied the Count the Pope the life of a man so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a	50.053627014160156
16002/28840	And it was Peppino you saved was it not cried Morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon   Perhaps returned the count	38.97175979614258
16003/28840	My dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said Morcer	44.07973098754883
16004/28840	For example here is Debray who reads and Beauchamp who prints every day A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the Rue	40.593223571777344
16005/28840	Tell them yourself that I was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of	53.3070068359375
16006/28840	Sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du He	85.14863586425781
16007/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo you promised me never to mention that	24.398366928100586
16008/28840	It was not I who made that promise cried Morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have	40.10674285888672

16010/28840	It seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what	55.646549224853516
16011/28840	20249m       Well you promise me if I tell all I know to relate in your turn all that I do not know   That is but fair replied Monte Crist	23.3055362701416
16012/28840	The letter is still to be seen for it is in Franz dÉpinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of	59.276611328125
16013/28840	This is all I know but I know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who ordinarily have so little respect for	54.642635345458984

16023/28840	How have I deviated from those principles monsieur asked Monte Cristo who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing	21.425077438354492
16024/28840	Why it seems to me replied Morrel that in delivering	32.603092193603516

16026/28840	Of which he is the brightest ornament said Beauchamp drinking off a glass of	53.6715202331543

16028/28840	My dear vicomte returned Monte Cristo I do not see in all I have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies I have	35.260948181152344
16029/28840	I will appeal to any of these gentlemen could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him Besides you know I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to	46.18987274169922
16030/28840	You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your	70.9781494140625
16031/28840	I will keep it returned Morcerf but I fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic hor	32.0512809753418

16034/28840	I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as I shared yours at RomeI who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist _par excellence_ for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were	88.11097717285156
16035/28840	Ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected	30.853811264038086
16036/28840	May I congratulate you   The affair is still in	44.24809265136719
16037/28840	And he who says in projection means already decided said Debr	91.88518524169922

16047/28840	Can my influence with them be of any service to you   Oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruit	76.81776428222656

16051/28840	We were speaking of a suitable habitation for the Count of Monte Crist	21.475282669067383

16054/28840	The count will find there a charming hotel with a court and	216.47474670410156

16058/28840	You have no idea then Morrel asked ChâteauRenaud you do not propose	28.072052001953125

16063/28840	One minute cried Albert without giving Monte Cristo the time to	136.25698852539062

16065/28840	20255m       Oh no said Morrel my sister is fiveandtwenty my brotherinlaw is thirty they are gay young and	23.7192440032959
16066/28840	Besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do	31.119844436645508
16067/28840	Thanks monsieur said Monte Cristo I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already	21.890085220336914
16068/28840	What cried Morcerf you are then going to a hotelthat will be very dull for	28.32168960571289
16069/28840	Was I so badly lodged at Rome said Monte Cristo	67.34632873535156
16070/28840	_Parbleu_ at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every	36.35755157470703
16071/28840	It is not that which deterred me replied Monte Cristo but as I determined to have a house to myself I sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished	33.62770080566406
16072/28840	But you have then a valet de chambre who knows Paris said Beauch	15.440807342529297
16073/28840	It is the first time he has ever been in	14.2723388671875
16074/28840	He is black and cannot speak returned Monte Crist	51.317283630371094
16075/28840	It is Ali cried Albert in the midst of the general	56.70943069458008
16076/28840	Yes Ali himself my Nubian mute whom you saw I think at	99.38639068603516
16077/28840	Certainly said Morcerf I recollect him	20.564916610717773
16078/28840	But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything	124.46466064453125
16079/28840	Undeceive yourself monsieur replied Monte Cristo I am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as I	16.713821411132812
16080/28840	He knows my tastes my caprices my	337.9931945800781
16081/28840	He has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by	81.8232192993164
16082/28840	He knew that I should arrive today at ten oclock he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de Fontaineble	17.92000389099121
16083/28840	He gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and Monte Cristo passed a paper to	69.35820770263672
16084/28840	Ah that is really original said Beauch	43.244178771972656
16085/28840	What do you not know your house asked Debr	13.598465919494629
16086/28840	No said Monte Cristo I told you I did not wish to be behind my time I dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts	25.005233764648438
16087/28840	I in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to	151.26971435546875
16088/28840	Thanks monsieur returned Monte Cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each	22.994094848632812
16089/28840	Is your steward also a Nubian asked Debr	27.74457359313965
16090/28840	No he is a countryman of yours if a Corsican is a countryman of any	29.00026512145996
16091/28840	Bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well   Yes you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smugglerin fact	44.15983200073242
16092/28840	I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some triflea stab with a knife for	31.27729034423828
16093/28840	And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said Debr	26.2735595703125
16094/28840	Of how much does he rob you every year   On my word replied the count not more than	28.474088668823242
16095/28840	I am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so I keep	152.55706787109375
16096/28840	Then continued ChâteauRenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the ChampsÉlysées you only want a	19.20332908630371
16097/28840	He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the counts box at the Argentina and Valle theat	26.457202911376953
16098/28840	I have something better than that said Monte Cristo I have a	13.2576904296875
16099/28840	You procure your mistresses from the opera the Vaudeville or the Variétés I purchased mine at Constantinople it cost me more but I have nothing to	61.065032958984375
16100/28840	But you forget replied Debray laughing that we are Franks by name and franks by nature as King Charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes	80.87434387207031
16101/28840	Who will tell her   The first person who sees	38.933712005615234
16102/28840	But at least we shall see her said Beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes   Oh no replied Monte Cristo I do not carry brutalism so	29.635791778564453
16103/28840	Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit	35.095245361328125
16104/28840	They had long since passed to dessert and	205.48532104492188
16105/28840	My dear Albert said Debray rising it is halfpast	24.52178955078125
16106/28840	Your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst	268.2572937011719
16107/28840	I will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he	21.202091217041016
16108/28840	Take care returned Albert no one has been able to accomplish	76.68754577636719
16109/28840	Oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this	45.217041015625
16110/28840	And when you know will you tell me   I promise	28.001110076904297
16111/28840	As he left the room Debray called out loudly My	42.356266021728516
16112/28840	Bravo said Beauchamp to Albert I shall not go to the Chamber but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of	47.20151138305664
16113/28840	For heavens sake Beauchamp returned Morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him	30.88425064086914
16114/28840	Is he not peculiar   He is more than that replied ChâteauRenaud he is one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my	23.8450870513916
16115/28840	Are you coming Morrel   Directly I have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at Rue Meslay	31.684261322021484
16116/28840	Be sure I shall not fail to do so returned the count b	36.003692626953125
16117/28840	And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de ChâteauRenaud leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcer	10.110503196716309
16118/28840	The Presentation   When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo My dear count said he allow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you a specimen of a bachelors	31.60238265991211
16119/28840	You who are accustomed to the palaces of Italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can	56.14948654174805
16120/28840	As we pass from one room to another I will open the windows to let you	102.88787841796875
16121/28840	Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground	40.2161979675293
16122/28840	Albert led him first to his _atelier_ which was as we have said his favorite	44.518795013427734
16123/28840	Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all that Albert had collected hereold cabinets Japanese porcelain Oriental stuffs Venetian glass arms from all parts of the worldeverything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their	49.12116241455078
16124/28840	Morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural	48.89363479614258
16125/28840	They descended to the first floor Albert led his guest into the	49.972373962402344
16126/28840	From the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple	47.49969482421875
16127/28840	A single portrait signed by Léopold Robert shone in its carved and gilded	45.27302932739258
16128/28840	This portrait attracted the Count of Monte Cristos attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before	60.62103271484375
16129/28840	It was the portrait of a young woman of five or sixandtwenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long	33.51863098144531
16130/28840	She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her	22.071046829223633
16131/28840	She was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and	70.71248626708984
16132/28840	The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the counts visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and	73.84213256835938
16133/28840	Silence prevailed for an instant during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the	46.32814407348633
16134/28840	You have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumea ball costume doubtlessbecomes her admir	63.69858932495117
16135/28840	Ah monsieur returned Albert I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside	52.30080032348633
16136/28840	You do not know my mother she it is whom you see	59.29642868041992
16137/28840	She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years	85.06998443603516
16138/28840	This costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in	70.21434020996094
16139/28840	The countess had this portrait painted during the counts	53.23388671875
16140/28840	She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of Léopold Robert could not overcome his dislike to	43.68418502807617
16141/28840	It is true between ourselves that	96.24691772460938
16142/28840	de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of	29.57716178894043
16143/28840	It is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease	52.43849563598633
16144/28840	de Morcerf whose portrait by Gros I will also show	105.4715805053711
16145/28840	Excuse my talking of family matters but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this	64.50869750976562
16146/28840	The picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without	75.46435546875
16147/28840	This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their	50.25630187988281
16148/28840	20261m       Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his	16.37659454345703
16149/28840	Now said Albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they	30.588592529296875
16150/28840	Consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of	38.03740692138672
16151/28840	de Morcerf he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom I announced your promised visit and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in	65.95325469970703
16152/28840	You are somewhat _blasé_ I know and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor who has seen so many	55.65108871459961

16154/28840	Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a	69.53252410888672

16308/28840	I have never before been at Paris and it is the first time I have ever even set my foot in	33.148677825927734
16309/28840	Ah that is different the house you purchase is at Auteu	43.73684310913086

16313/28840	What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris	92.99649047851562
16314/28840	Bertuccio   I cried the steward with a strange	22.06638526916504
16315/28840	His excellency did not charge me to purchase this	48.659263610839844
16316/28840	If his excellency will recollectif he will think   Ah true observed Monte Cristo I recollect	24.81300926208496

16318/28840	It is not yet too late cried Bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission I will find you a better at Enghien at FontenayauxRoses or at Bellev	27.434837341308594
16319/28840	Oh no returned Monte Cristo negligently since I have this I will keep	53.9741325378418
16320/28840	And you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his	36.69266128540039
16321/28840	It is a charming place well supplied with springwater and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought	106.11836242675781
16322/28840	I suppose the count has the tastes of the day   To be sure returned Monte Cristo it is very convenient then   It is moreit is	23.7791805267334
16323/28840	_Peste_ let us not lose such an opportunity returned Monte Crist	37.929325103759766
16324/28840	And he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the propriet	63.66585159301758
16325/28840	Bertuccio said he give fiftyfive thousand francs to monsie	22.644351959228516
16326/28840	The steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of banknotes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all	32.060550689697266
16327/28840	And now demanded the count are all the forms complied with   All	82.32227325439453
16328/28840	Have you the keys   They are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new	32.1444206237793

16333/28840	Well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite	27.87734603881836
16334/28840	The notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar	26.240966796875
16335/28840	See this gentleman out said the count to Bertucc	30.913387298583984
16336/28840	And the steward followed the notary out of the	21.172914505004883
16337/28840	Scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left	34.305381774902344
16338/28840	After having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his _souvenirs_   Auteuil Rue de la Fontaine	34.945613861083984

16341/28840	Bertuccio   The steward appeared at the	14.97945499420166
16342/28840	Monsieur Bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in France   In some parts of Franceyes excell	16.6270809173584
16343/28840	You know the environs of Paris then   No excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which Monte Cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquiet	30.68616485595703
16344/28840	It is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for I wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful	54.64430236816406

16346/28840	Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any	32.88665008544922
16347/28840	Why what has happened to youare you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked Monte Cristo in the same tone that Louis	29.629425048828125
16348/28840	pronounced the famous I have been almost obliged to	238.8387451171875

16354/28840	Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewards extraordinary repugnance for the counts projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little	94.28844451904297
16355/28840	In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to augment as they entered the	39.980838775634766
16356/28840	Bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they	62.49139404296875

16359/28840	Bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanRue de la Fontaine	26.757375717163086

16370/28840	Ah I am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for	56.54352951049805
16371/28840	The Marquis of SaintMéran returned the	8.979257583618164

16375/28840	Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from	48.6096076965332
16376/28840	And is not this daughter dead demanded Monte Cristo I fancy I have heard	69.33731079101562

16383/28840	The steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to	45.28948211669922
16384/28840	They went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the	41.153099060058594
16385/28840	Ah here is a private staircase said the count that is	38.02705383300781

16392/28840	Go on Monsieur Bertuccio said the	8.655696868896484
16393/28840	But he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recol	44.8681755065918
16394/28840	No no cried Bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior	30.387344360351562
16395/28840	No monsieur it is impossible I can go no	23.22014617919922

16400/28840	The door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into	54.945796966552734
16401/28840	The steward wished to turn to the	30.636674880981445

16408/28840	Monsieur I implore you do not stay there   I think you are going mad Bertuccio said the count cold	14.556441307067871
16409/28840	If that is the case I warn you I shall have you put in a lunatic	19.970457077026367
16410/28840	Alas excellency returned Bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous	28.659027099609375
16411/28840	Alas excellency the evil has arrived  	37.45525360107422
16412/28840	I knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and I overlooked that in Italy because in Italy those things are thought nothing	71.41200256347656
16413/28840	But in France they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which a	58.222450256347656
16414/28840	Bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered count	44.00764083862305
16415/28840	Well I shall write to the abbé I shall hold him responsible for his _protégés_ misconduct and I shall soon know all about this	24.521181106567383

16419/28840	I do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus	27.93280601501465
16420/28840	It is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a	74.5043716430664
16421/28840	Oh your excellency returned Bertuccio in deep	19.159326553344727
16422/28840	Or as you are a Corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call	27.35536003112793
16423/28840	Yes my good master cried Bertuccio casting himself at the counts feet it was simply vengeancenothing	37.3207893371582
16424/28840	I understand that but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this	21.36503028869629
16425/28840	But monsieur it is very natural returned Bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was	26.92620849609375

16429/28840	This is strange returned Monte Cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much	50.7637825012207
16430/28840	Monsieur said the steward it is fatality I am	13.934871673583984

16432/28840	Well amiable Corsican let us suppose it is	58.1146354675293

16443/28840	That is different replied Monte Cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at	38.1882209777832

16450/28840	Bah replied Monte Cristo impossible   It is as I tell	25.50545883178711
16451/28840	Have you proof of this   I had	61.31850814819336
16452/28840	And you have lost it how stupid   Yes but by careful search it might be	84.28103637695312
16453/28840	Really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest	41.749046325683594
16454/28840	And the count humming an air from _Lucia_ went to sit down on a bench while Bertuccio followed him collecting his	42.318416595458984
16455/28840	The Vendetta   At what point shall I begin my story your excellency asked Bertucc	38.42636489868164
16456/28840	Where you please returned Monte Cristo since I know nothing at all of	27.835451126098633
16457/28840	I thought the Abbé Busoni had told your excell	8.758330345153809
16458/28840	Some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and I have forgotten	53.41606140136719
16459/28840	Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excell	75.06874084472656
16460/28840	Bertuccio you will supply the want of the evening	177.03648376464844

16462/28840	No monsieur and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but	40.7220573425293
16463/28840	I had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of Cors	41.80622863769531

16465/28840	He brought me up as if I had been his son and in 1814 he	32.94015121459961

16467/28840	But that is the history of the Hundred Days	36.961265563964844
16468/28840	Bertuccio said the count unless I am mistaken it has been already	44.60139846801758
16469/28840	Excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be	81.65328979492188
16470/28840	Go on I will keep my	75.14989471435547
16471/28840	I should tell you that we lived in the little village of Rogliano at the extremity of Cap Cor	30.469280242919922
16472/28840	In the smuggling line said Monte Crist	35.94027328491211
16473/28840	I loved my brother tenderly as I told your excellency and I resolved not to send the money but to take it to him	29.699626922607422
16474/28840	I left five hundred with Assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred I set off for Nî	53.29840087890625
16475/28840	It was easy to do so and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my	105.07596588134766
16476/28840	But after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhô	36.77556610107422
16477/28840	At last however we succeeded and worked up to Ar	302.3851013183594
16478/28840	I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire and took the road to Nî	11.340320587158203
16479/28840	We are getting to the story now   Yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see I only tell you what is absolutely	26.365022659301758
16480/28840	Just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of	25.222370147705078
16481/28840	Three brigands called Trestaillon Truphemy and Graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapart	91.58995056152344
16482/28840	You have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency   Vaguely I was far from France at that	42.59287643432617
16483/28840	As I entered Nîmes I literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and	134.36056518554688
16484/28840	My misgivings had been but too	70.25858306884766
16485/28840	My brother had arrived the previous evening at Nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been	14.253686904907227
16486/28840	I did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they	51.599117279052734
16487/28840	I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much and which feared nothing and I went to the kings	40.24090576171875
16488/28840	And this kings attorney was named Villefort asked Monte Cristo care	29.800445556640625
16489/28840	Yes your excellency he came from Marseilles where he had been deputy procure	17.899606704711914
16490/28840	His zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the Island of El	24.765155792236328
16491/28840	Then said Monte Cristo you went to him   Monsieur I said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of Nîmes I know not by whom but it is your duty to find	24.045236587524414
16492/28840	You are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to	61.80415344238281

16495/28840	You are mistaken monsieur I replied he has perished by the poni	32.25371551513672
16496/28840	What do you want me to do asked the	17.502117156982422
16497/28840	On whom   On his	183.04736328125
16498/28840	How should I know who they are   Order them to be sought	48.66812515258789
16499/28840	Why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a	47.759429931640625
16500/28840	All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly	76.64736938476562
16501/28840	Pray try and obtain a small government pension for	327.3077087402344
16502/28840	Every revolution has its catastrophes returned	184.33425903320312
16503/28840	de Villefort your brother has been the victim of	32.966094970703125
16504/28840	It is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his	148.7859344482422
16505/28840	If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to	61.29745864868164
16506/28840	What has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of repris	63.44719314575195
16507/28840	What cried I do you a magistrate speak thus to me   All these Corsicans are mad on my honor replied	57.91073226928711
16508/28840	de Villefort they fancy that their countryman is still	111.07028198242188
16509/28840	You have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late	61.502464294433594
16510/28840	Go now at once or I shall have you put	93.97554779052734
16511/28840	I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreat	44.350311279296875
16512/28840	But he was a man of	46.17842102050781
16513/28840	I approached him and said in a low voice Well since you know the Corsicans so well you know that they always keep their	40.26850891113281
16514/28840	You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a Bonapartist because you are a royal	22.497556686401367
16515/28840	Well I who am a Bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that I will kill	33.66767501831055
16516/28840	From this moment I declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has	61.08690643310547
16517/28840	And before he had recovered from his surprise I opened the door and left the	22.64460563659668
16518/28840	Well well said Monte Cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things	54.71540451049805
16519/28840	Bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that But did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta   He knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and	54.21285629272461
16520/28840	Fortunately I was so well concealed that he could not find	43.98261260986328
16521/28840	Then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to Versa	40.82630920410156
16522/28840	But as you know a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a days journey before me who followed him on	137.62437438964844
16523/28840	The most important thing was not to kill him onlyfor I had an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesbut to kill him without being discoveredat least without being	47.56591033935547
16524/28840	I no longer belonged to myself for I had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide	63.23076629638672
16525/28840	de Villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following	77.89675903320312
16526/28840	At length I discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteu	45.086517333984375
16527/28840	Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio	25.367910385131836
16528/28840	As I had nothing more to do at Versailles I went to Auteuil and gained all the information I	17.471033096313477
16529/28840	If I wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for	71.58809661865234
16530/28840	The house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to	31.08795738220215
16531/28840	de SaintMéran lived at Marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the Baron	30.760211944580078
16532/28840	One evening as I was looking over the wall I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and I guessed that she was awaiting	44.49683380126953
16533/28840	When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very	126.73360443115234
16534/28840	As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure I saw she would ere long become a	99.36217498779297
16535/28840	A few moments after the little door was opened and a man	37.04105758666992
16536/28840	The young woman hastened to meet	24.614900588989258
16537/28840	They threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the	52.62302017211914
16538/28840	de Villefort I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden	28.204771041870117
16539/28840	20291m       And asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman   No excellency returned Bertuccio you will see that I had no time to learn	11.620914459228516
16540/28840	Three days after about seven oclock in the evening I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to Sèv	18.324140548706055
16541/28840	I concluded that he was going to Versailles and I was not	17.040515899658203
16542/28840	Three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after	51.34898376464844
16543/28840	I descended rapidly although I had not seen Villeforts face I recognized him by the beating of my	37.299400329589844
16544/28840	I crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which I had once before looked into the	32.055477142333984
16545/28840	This time I did not content myself with looking but I took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the	44.345680236816406
16546/28840	My first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the	76.39016723632812
16547/28840	Nothing then preventing my escape by this means I examined the	173.83619689941406
16548/28840	The garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and	60.74673080444336
16549/28840	In order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door	31.450023651123047
16550/28840	de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of	20.56654930114746
16551/28840	20293m       It was the end of September the wind blew	17.08256721496582
16552/28840	Two hours passed thus during which I imagined I heard moans	94.38240814208984
16553/28840	As the last stroke died away I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just	25.169342041015625
16554/28840	The door opened and the man in the mantle reapp	25.11607551574707
16555/28840	The terrible moment had come but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the	39.898704528808594
16556/28840	I drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to	54.425228118896484
16557/28840	The man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his	25.749893188476562
16558/28840	I was afraid not of a struggle but of a	93.800537109375
16559/28840	When he was only a few paces from me I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a sp	37.64897537231445
16560/28840	I was still unable to divine for what reason	118.57827758789062
16561/28840	de Villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where I was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the	38.963016510009766
16562/28840	I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more	58.658390045166016
16563/28840	Then I confess curiosity mingled with hatred I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there and I remained motionless holding my	31.459285736083984
16564/28840	Then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches	54.70074462890625
16565/28840	I know not if he heard these words I think he did not for he fell without a	42.360267639160156
16566/28840	I felt his blood gush over my face but I was intoxicated I was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning	68.71051788330078
16567/28840	In a second I had disinterred the box then that it might not be known I had done so I filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which I doublelocked carrying off the	35.83150863647461
16568/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and	30.46976661682129
16569/28840	No your excellency returned Bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by	16.686933517456055
16570/28840	And was the sum a large one   It was not	90.97991180419922
16571/28840	Ah I recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant   Yes excellency I hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the	23.98594093322754
16572/28840	In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn	235.27752685546875
16573/28840	Its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my	77.34029388427734
16574/28840	In my turn I uttered a cry but a cry of	24.248065948486328
16575/28840	God has not cursed me then I cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life I have taken	43.96540832519531
16576/28840	20295m       And what did you do with the child asked Monte Crist	9.450922966003418
16577/28840	It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to	62.59866714477539

16588/28840	No you were not for it was in reality a little	58.86783981323242

16591/28840	Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a	61.0579833984375

16593/28840	We profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends	54.27174758911133
16594/28840	We had thus at AiguesMortes Martigues or Bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and customhouse	35.07724380493164

16600/28840	My journeys became more and more extensive and more	87.95927429199219
16601/28840	Assunta took care of all and our little fortune	281.5531311035156
16602/28840	One day as I was setting off on an expedition Go said she at your return I will give you a	115.0095443725586
16603/28840	I questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and I	97.61692810058594
16604/28840	Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to Lucca to take in oil to Leghorn for English cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of	101.41133880615234
16605/28840	When I entered the house the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assuntas chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months	51.63287353515625
16606/28840	I uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness I had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this	43.69345474243164
16607/28840	For the assassination itself I had never felt any	264.8764953613281

16609/28840	No objection was raised and the infant was given up to	80.71912384033203
16610/28840	Ah I confess your excellency when I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle I felt my eyes filled with	34.08867645263672
16611/28840	Ah Assunta cried I you are an excellent woman and Heaven will bless	84.3709487915039
16612/28840	This said Monte Cristo is less correct than your philosophyit is only	39.69605255126953
16613/28840	Alas your excellency is right replied Bertuccio and God made this infant the instrument of our	41.554447174072266
16614/28840	Never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing	72.62081146240234
16615/28840	Unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether	87.6103744506836
16616/28840	The proverb was but too correct as regarded Benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst	71.20194244384766
16617/28840	It is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged	32.84421157836914
16618/28840	One day Benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a	59.4393310546875
16619/28840	For more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a	54.158050537109375
16620/28840	A boatman who had passed by Rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to	59.61597442626953
16621/28840	Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said I confess how you obtained this	254.74818420410156
16622/28840	Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his ver	99.27527618408203
16623/28840	I became angry he began to laugh I threatened to strike him and he made two steps	95.35281372070312
16624/28840	You cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my	62.09931945800781
16625/28840	20299m       We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching	63.12942123413086
16626/28840	When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master and everything went	93.8614730834961
16627/28840	When he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in Bastia or indeed in Corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a	82.84139251708984
16628/28840	I became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious	116.65086364746094
16629/28840	I was compelled at this period to leave Corsica on an important expedition I reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune I resolved that Benedetto should accompany	45.276214599609375
16630/28840	I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite	65.86509704589844
16631/28840	I spoke to Benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of	47.02442932128906
16632/28840	He heard me patiently and when I had finished burst out	95.31466674804688
16633/28840	The arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied	58.08305358886719

16635/28840	I gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the	74.95960235595703

16637/28840	My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own	98.31421661376953
16638/28840	I set off for France after having fixed upon the	104.1486587524414
16639/28840	Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 18	50.8596305847168
16640/28840	The most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the customhouse officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at Beauca	35.4244384765625
16641/28840	20301m       Our expedition made a favorable	30.023435592651367
16642/28840	We anchored our vesselwhich had a double hold where our goods were concealedamidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhône from Beaucaire to Ar	65.98534393310547
16643/28840	On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were	33.90043258666992
16644/28840	Whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed I know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabinboy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our	50.76886749267578
16645/28840	It was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhône but the care according to the boys account that they took to avoid being	55.126243591308594
16646/28840	I was now safe for I could swim along the ditch without being seen and I reached the canal in	58.5990104675293
16647/28840	I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from Nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beauca	13.468876838684082
16648/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo I perfectly recollect him I think he was your	29.211864471435547
16649/28840	Precisely answered Bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in	71.30122375488281
16650/28840	Of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that I intended to ask	77.1649169921875
16651/28840	What was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccios	33.976234436035156
16652/28840	Gaspard Caderousse he had married a woman from the village of Carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her	36.03765106201172
16653/28840	She was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by	175.5252227783203
16654/28840	As for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or fiveandforty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and	35.56049728393555
16655/28840	And you say interrupted Monte Cristo that this took place towards the year   1829 your excell	29.553468704223633
16656/28840	The beginning or the end   The evening of the 3	77.76627349853516
16657/28840	20303m       Ah said Monte Cristo the evening of the 3rd of June 18	11.832243919372559
16658/28840	My intention was if Caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the customhouse officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its	83.51653289794922
16659/28840	I stepped into the shed and it was fortunate I did so for at that moment Caderousse entered with a	57.12015151977539
16660/28840	I waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because I could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often	73.6673812866211
16661/28840	Then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife Hello Carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is	54.29825210571289
16662/28840	An exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble	33.814632415771484
16663/28840	What do you say asked his wife pale as	82.1790771484375
16664/28840	I say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of Paris will give us 50000 francs for	22.318071365356445
16665/28840	Only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as I have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our	38.35159683227539
16666/28840	In the meantime please to sit down monsieur and I will fetch you some refresh	27.4133358001709
16667/28840	The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a	36.20698165893555
16668/28840	Relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two recitals	46.44791030883789
16669/28840	Oh returned she it was a gift of	113.45418548583984
16670/28840	My husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named Edmond Dantè	13.741284370422363
16671/28840	This poor fellow whom Caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to	46.71809005737305
16672/28840	The same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be	94.8458251953125
16673/28840	Theres only the price we are not agreed	78.61927032470703
16674/28840	I thought we agreed for the price I	379.3388366699219
16675/28840	That is replied the jeweller I offered 40000 franc	33.8354377746582
16676/28840	Forty thousand cried La Carconte we will not part with it for that	59.12406539916992
16677/28840	The abbé told us it was worth 50000 without the	40.4909553527832
16678/28840	What was the abbés name asked the indefatigable question	38.52238082885742
16679/28840	He was a foreigner   An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua I	31.78206443786621
16680/28840	Let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a	52.21733474731445
16681/28840	Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jew	22.960575103759766
16682/28840	At the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut La Carcontes eyes sparkled with cup	23.902944564819336
16683/28840	And what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said Monte Cristo did you credit it   Yes your excell	10.21656322479248
16684/28840	I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man and I thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a	37.84804153442383
16685/28840	That did more honor to your heart than to your experience	131.86607360839844
16686/28840	The jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it	34.030364990234375
16687/28840	I will give you 45000 said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone I brought just that sum with	58.616756439208984
16688/28840	Oh thats no matter replied Caderousse I will go back with you to fetch the other 5000 franc	24.878976821899414
16689/28840	No returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse no it is worth no more and I am sorry I offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which I had not	42.200340270996094
16690/28840	However I will not go back on my word and I will give 45	21.970441818237305
16691/28840	At least replace the diamond in the ring said La Carconte	82.42388153076172
16692/28840	Ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the	34.269989013671875
16693/28840	No matter observed Caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase	64.22864532470703
16694/28840	Yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as I am or content himself with the same	33.04737854003906
16695/28840	It is not natural that a man like you should possess such a	36.21979522705078
16696/28840	You will have to find the Abbé Busoni and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are	39.33377456665039
16697/28840	Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each	34.48176193237305
16698/28840	No said Caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5000 franc	10.092447280883789
16699/28840	As you please my dear sir said the jeweller I had however as you see brought you the money in bright	51.12065124511719
16700/28840	And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank	17.691482543945312
16701/28840	There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his	51.690528869628906
16702/28840	What do you think of this he asked in a low	14.603418350219727
16703/28840	Let him have itlet him have it she	271.5641784667969
16704/28840	If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoniin all probability we shall never see	46.459449768066406
16705/28840	Well then so I will said Caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45000 franc	30.853120803833008
16706/28840	But my wife wants a gold chain and I want a pair of silver buck	37.80488586425781
16707/28840	The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles	43.78725051879883
16708/28840	Here he said I am very straightforward in my dealingstake your	51.38602828979492
16709/28840	The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen franc	58.19477462768555
16710/28840	I hope you will not complain now said the jew	34.714454650878906
16711/28840	The abbé told me it was worth 50000 francs muttered Cader	8.790914535522461
16712/28840	Come comegive it to me What a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his	51.9946403503418
16713/28840	Here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15000 francs in gold and 30000 francs in bank	24.798341751098633
16714/28840	Wait whilst I light the lamp said La Carconte it is growing dark and there may be some	48.14248275756836
16715/28840	In fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half	91.56768035888672
16716/28840	The thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller Caderousse or La Carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of	40.582725524902344
16717/28840	I myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these banknotes it seemed to me that I was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream I felt myself riveted to the	31.944826126098633
16718/28840	Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her	67.85599517822266
16719/28840	During this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichprecursors of the stormbegan to play in at the	63.60928726196289
16720/28840	Well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right   Yes said Cader	35.29538345336914
16721/28840	Give me the pocketbook La Carconte and find a bag	79.78487396240234
16722/28840	La Carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocketbook and a	49.61832809448242
16723/28840	From the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknotes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable	52.16140365600586
16724/28840	There said Caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10000 francs will you have your supper with us I invite you with	56.469085693359375
16725/28840	Thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and I must return to Beaucairemy wife will be getting	47.30336380004883
16726/28840	He drew out his watch and exclaimed _Morbleu_ nearly nine oclockwhy I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight Goodnight my	36.2639045715332
16727/28840	If the Abbé Busoni should by any accident return think of	47.63642120361328
16728/28840	In another week you will have left Beaucaire remarked Caderousse for the fair ends in a few	46.457855224609375
16729/28840	Write to me at Paris to	63.15922927856445
16730/28840	Joannes in the Palais Royal arcade Pierre	67.51870727539062
16731/28840	I will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth	49.574424743652344
16732/28840	At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the	27.14228630065918
16733/28840	20307m       See here exclaimed Cader	18.639991760253906
16734/28840	You cannot think of going out in such weather as	117.06180572509766
16735/28840	Oh I am not afraid of thunder said the jew	28.24332046508789
16736/28840	And then there are robbers said La Carcon	23.615644454956055
16737/28840	The road is never very safe during fair	401.7665100097656
16738/28840	Oh as to the robbers said Joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the	38.393280029296875
16739/28840	Here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond Friend Cader	74.57979583740234
16740/28840	Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning	67.89745330810547
16741/28840	It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible	35.590660095214844
16742/28840	Well then a good journey to you said Cader	23.868833541870117

16772/28840	_Ma foi_ said the jeweller drenched with rain I am not destined to return to Beaucaire	27.63760757446289

16781/28840	Nobody but ourselves replied Caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellersindeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping	76.12904357910156
16782/28840	Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience	58.05386734008789

16784/28840	But where will you manage to stow me   In the chamber	31.845277786254883

16793/28840	From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning	91.16033935546875
16794/28840	There there said La Carconte do you hear that upon my word you did well to come	29.110231399536133

16796/28840	Its the mistral said Caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow	35.104122161865234
16797/28840	Well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all I can say is so much the worse for those who are	24.137218475341797
16798/28840	Yes chimed in La Carconte they will have a wretched night of	58.14432144165039
16799/28840	The jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive host	80.19792938232422
16800/28840	Had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished	54.94026565551758
16801/28840	Caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened	46.71565246582031
16802/28840	I believe the storm is over said	53.65966033935547

16804/28840	Trembling and awestruck Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hear	30.857864379882812
16805/28840	You must be tired said she to the jeweller I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep	52.97848129272461
16806/28840	He passed over my head and I heard the flooring creak beneath his	40.11640548706055
16807/28840	The quick eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended while Caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at	39.77684783935547
16808/28840	Overhead I could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his	59.05452346801758
16809/28840	Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong I sought not to shake it	76.83380889892578
16810/28840	La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to	31.96732521057129
16811/28840	At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the	43.787803649902344

16815/28840	Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually I fell into a deep heavy sl	86.99534606933594
16816/28840	How long I had been in this unconscious state I know not when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful	49.78560256958008
16817/28840	Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the	56.8328742980957
16818/28840	I had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again I heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly	81.53131103515625
16819/28840	A cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy letharg	72.60232543945312
16820/28840	To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silenceunbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber	58.57688522338867

16823/28840	Having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy	176.0807647705078
16824/28840	Then all became clear and manifest to me and I reproached myself with what had happened as though I myself had done the guilty	76.54940795898438
16825/28840	For this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining	73.90751647949219
16826/28840	The poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and I found myself in the	75.25596618652344
16827/28840	Hastily snatching up the lighted candle I hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the	137.5726776123047
16828/28840	The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at	104.70625305175781
16829/28840	The shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in	114.13363647460938
16830/28840	I strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest	183.173095703125
16831/28840	The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the	55.27627944946289

16929/28840	His excellency does not receive visitors	72.2767333984375
16930/28840	Then here is my masters card the Baron Dangl	34.13411331176758
16931/28840	You will take it to the count and say that although in haste to attend the Chamber my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon	36.65944290161133

16955/28840	I am perfectly aware of that fact answered Monte Cristo	34.119102478027344

16991/28840	As he passed them he said   They are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them	59.12284851074219

17009/28840	The Count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers	39.34254455566406
17010/28840	Danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad	19.36979866027832

17037/28840	You have received a regular letter of advice   Yes said Danglars but I confess I didnt quite comprehend its	30.896013259887695
17038/28840	Indeed   And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an	27.829147338867188
17039/28840	Here I am ready to give you any explanation you	31.00963592529297
17040/28840	Why said Danglars in the letterI believe I have it about mehere he felt in his breastpocketyes here it	60.2796630859375
17041/28840	Well this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our	26.952529907226562
17042/28840	Well baron what is there difficult to understand about that   Merely the term _unlimited_nothing else	57.81022262573242
17043/28840	Is not that word known in France The people who wrote are AngloGermans you	183.927734375
17044/28840	Oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document I certainly have	50.42567825317383
17045/28840	Is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and cand	95.36640167236328
17046/28840	Is it possible that Thomson  French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers Pray tell me what you think baron for I feel uneasy I can assure you having some considerable property in their	52.58022689819336
17047/28840	Thomson  French are perfectly solvent replied Danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word _unlimited_ in financial affairs is so extremely	46.39166259765625
17048/28840	Is in fact unlimited said Monte Crist	39.00046920776367
17049/28840	Precisely what I was about to say cried Dangl	71.06172180175781
17050/28840	Now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep	156.69635009765625
17051/28840	Meaning to say rejoined Monte Cristo that however Thomson  French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their	31.0858154296875
17052/28840	Thomson  French set no bounds to their engagements while those of	196.50592041015625
17053/28840	Danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own	42.4586181640625
17054/28840	Monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been	31.709003448486328
17055/28840	It seems then reserved for me said Monte Cristo coldly to be the first to do	22.07014274597168
17056/28840	By what right sir   By right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some	95.6776351928711
17057/28840	It was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own	26.99675178527832
17058/28840	His forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impert	144.9535369873047
17059/28840	Monte Cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the	43.654762268066406
17060/28840	The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper	73.33561706542969
17061/28840	I said a million replied Danglars with the confidence of	39.74644088745117
17062/28840	But could I do with a million retorted the	95.31462097167969
17063/28840	My dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me I should never have given myself the trouble of opening an	50.71273422241211
17064/28840	A million Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocketbook or dressing	46.6136589050293
17065/28840	And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visitingcards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500000 francs each payable at sight to the	30.067419052124023
17066/28840	A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of	46.224761962890625
17067/28840	The effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apople	46.10135269165039
17068/28840	The pupils of his eyes as he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated	51.01953125
17069/28840	Come come said Monte Cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson 	35.437461853027344
17070/28840	I understand and foreseeing that such might be the case I took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain	72.2834243774414
17071/28840	See here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of Arstein  Eskeles of Vienna to Baron Rothschild the other drawn by Baring of London upon	47.26621627807617
17072/28840	Now sir you have but to say the word and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two	53.67280960083008
17073/28840	Nay answered Monte Cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommod	41.449668884277344
17074/28840	Then you can let me have some money can you not   Whatever you say my dear count I am at your	33.74742889404297
17075/28840	Why replied Monte Cristo since we mutually understand each otherfor such I presume is the case Danglars bowed assent	36.749717712402344
17076/28840	You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind   Oh my dear count exclaimed Danglars I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards	37.81153106689453
17077/28840	Then if I should require more continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner why of course I should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I	43.235931396484375
17078/28840	Be kind enough then to send me 500000 francs	93.59259796142578
17079/28840	I shall be at home till midday or if not I will leave a receipt with my stew	43.98867416381836
17080/28840	The money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my dear count replied Dangl	21.116008758544922
17081/28840	How would you like to have it in gold silver or notes   Half in gold and the other half in banknotes if you please said the count rising from his	44.69729232788086
17082/28840	I must confess to you count said Danglars that I have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of Europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to	25.326780319213867
17083/28840	May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it   It has been in the family a very long while returned Monte Cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the	46.42025375366211
17084/28840	The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few	66.03514099121094
17085/28840	Your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted	115.2554931640625
17086/28840	However you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere	36.90492630004883
17087/28840	And the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz dÉpin	31.572132110595703
17088/28840	With your tastes and means of gratifying them continued Danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the	80.58390045166016
17089/28840	If I mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the	89.22823333740234

17091/28840	I cannot endure the modern school of	83.0872573852539
17092/28840	You are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become	85.70098876953125
17093/28840	Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen Bartoloni and Canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive I think but very indifferently of our French sculpt	44.57332229614258
17094/28840	You have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compat	38.21967315673828
17095/28840	But all this may come later when we shall be better known to each	55.65559768676758
17096/28840	For the present I will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the Baroness Danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the	43.50457763671875
17097/28840	Monte Cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy l	55.05610275268555
17098/28840	Is the baroness at home inquired Dangl	25.76667594909668
17099/28840	And alone   No my lord madame has	75.03681182861328
17100/28840	Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_   No indeed replied Monte Cristo with a smile I do not arrogate to myself the right of so	28.81985855102539
17101/28840	Debray inquired Danglars with an air of indulgence and goodnature that made Monte Cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic	22.644216537475586
17102/28840	Yes my lord replied the servant	52.661949157714844
17103/28840	Danglars nodded his head then turning to Monte Cristo said	7.918365955352783
17104/28840	Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the Minister of the	19.115863800048828
17105/28840	As for my wife I must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in	36.01075744628906
17106/28840	Her maiden name was De Servières and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargon	91.3669662475586
17107/28840	I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars but I have already met	13.010274887084961
17108/28840	Ah indeed said Danglars and where was that   At the house of	23.99893569946289
17109/28840	Ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you   We were together a good deal during the Carnival at	38.365482330322266
17110/28840	Let me see have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape I forget how but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from	89.78512573242188
17111/28840	Her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his	55.64602279663086
17112/28840	With your permission said Danglars bowing I will precede you to show you the	18.867393493652344
17113/28840	By all means replied Monte Cristo I follow	41.525325775146484
17114/28840	The truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by	199.464111328125
17115/28840	Danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the	26.52662467956543
17116/28840	The decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debr	14.590241432189941
17117/28840	Lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to Madame Dangl	44.55770492553711
17118/28840	Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by Debr	41.486419677734375
17119/28840	This posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of	182.42349243164062
17120/28840	A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on	207.80841064453125
17121/28840	Danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with Danglars a free and easy	49.37812423706055
17122/28840	Baroness said Danglars give me leave to present to you the Count of Monte Cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at	22.935319900512695
17123/28840	I need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in Paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in Paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of	37.667442321777344
17124/28840	That means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which I trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertain	130.43405151367188
17125/28840	And when did you arrive here inquired	127.45429992675781
17126/28840	Coming as usual I presume from the extreme end of the globe Pardon meat least such I have heard is your	132.81314086914062
17127/28840	This time I have merely come from Cad	60.53853225708008
17128/28840	You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first	76.7266845703125
17129/28840	Paris is a horrible place in	216.85906982421875
17130/28840	Balls parties and _fêtes_ are over the Italian opera is in London the French opera everywhere except in	83.09724426269531
17131/28840	As for the Théatre Français you know of course that it is	32.24049377441406
17132/28840	The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the ChampdeMars and S	94.11151123046875
17133/28840	Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count   I shall do whatever they do at Paris madame if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of	56.74965286254883
17134/28840	Are you fond of horses count   I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East madame and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two thingsthe fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their	32.823246002197266
17135/28840	Nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies	61.055599212646484
17136/28840	You see madame how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings	118.72525787353516
17137/28840	At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undert	25.53577995300293
17138/28840	Madame Danglars turned very pale then exclaimed   I cannot believe it the thing is	25.249780654907227
17139/28840	I assure you madame replied the woman it is as I have	18.539627075195312
17140/28840	Turning impatiently towards her husband Madame Danglars demanded Is this true   Is what true madame inquired Danglars visibly	33.00758743286133
17141/28840	But what does she tell you   That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his	36.448585510253906
17142/28840	I desire to know what is the meaning of this   Be kind enough madame to listen to me said Dangl	11.082834243774414
17143/28840	Oh yes I will listen monsieur for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will	36.176048278808594
17144/28840	These two gentlemen shall decide between us but first I will state the case to	147.97032165527344
17145/28840	Gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars are two that belong exclusively to mea pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in	49.943359375
17146/28840	Debray I need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well	46.745052337646484
17147/28840	Well I had promised Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gonepositively	33.74610900878906
17148/28840	Danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry franc	30.891284942626953
17149/28840	Oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators   Madame replied Danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your	28.506742477416992
17150/28840	Nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in	35.537994384765625
17151/28840	But perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses   My dear love pray do not say any more about them and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and	69.51819610595703
17152/28840	The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards Monte Cristo and saidUpon my word count I am quite sorry not to have met you	29.545528411865234
17153/28840	You are setting up an establishment of course   Why yes replied the	31.548059463500977
17154/28840	I should have liked to have made you the offer of these	32.85981369018555
17155/28840	I have almost given them away as it is but as I before said I was anxious to get rid of them upon any	42.39609146118164
17156/28840	They were only fit for a young	44.18303298950195
17157/28840	I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said Monte Cristo but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and I do not think they were	43.10593795776367
17158/28840	Debray you are a connoisseur I believe let me have your opinion upon	34.25801467895508
17159/28840	As Debray walked towards the window Danglars approached his	26.396142959594727
17160/28840	I could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for	61.04084014892578
17161/28840	Some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is I have gained 16000 francs by the sale of	64.54019927978516
17162/28840	Come dont look so angry and you shall have 4000 francs of the money to do what you like with and Eugénie shall have	50.981388092041016
17163/28840	There what do you think now of the affair Wasnt I right to part with the horses   Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering	23.93310546875
17164/28840	I cannot be mistaken there are your horses The very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage   My dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the	27.10209083557129
17165/28840	How very singular cried Monte Cristo with wellfeigned aston	26.364896774291992
17166/28840	I cannot believe it murmured the	27.57216453552246
17167/28840	Madame Danglars whispered a few words in the ear of Debray who approached Monte Cristo saying The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the	18.557815551757812
17168/28840	I scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost mewell somewhere about 30000 franc	39.72382354736328
17169/28840	Debray conveyed the counts reply to the baron	16.528099060058594
17170/28840	Poor Danglars looked so crestfallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards	31.33074378967285
17171/28840	See said the count how very ungrateful women	28.54227638244629
17172/28840	Your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on	35.834205627441406
17173/28840	But so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is	122.83759307861328
17174/28840	Therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but	42.278358459472656
17175/28840	Danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of Olympic Jove predicted a	23.61851692199707
17176/28840	20347m       Excellent murmured Monte Cristo to himself as he came	15.778042793273926
17177/28840	All has gone according to my	76.4979248046875
17178/28840	The domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my	128.49485778808594

17183/28840	During the evening Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil accompanied by	22.74415397644043
17184/28840	The following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the	44.1513786315918
17185/28840	Ali observed his master as the Nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not   Ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the	33.56786346435547
17186/28840	With your lasso you could stop an ox   Again Ali repeated his affirmative	157.21746826171875
17187/28840	Or a tiger   Ali bowed his head in token of ass	22.499502182006836
17188/28840	A lion even   Ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled	101.52122497558594
17189/28840	I understand said Monte Cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion   Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many	36.11597442626953

17191/28840	Ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my	113.26051330566406
17192/28840	Ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching	35.32764434814453
17193/28840	Still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his	54.67453384399414
17194/28840	Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious	41.24294662475586
17195/28840	In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each others	29.91845703125
17196/28840	Terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a	38.070343017578125
17197/28840	The carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of	56.616943359375
17198/28840	Gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his	77.37728881835938

17206/28840	All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars beautiful horses and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to	58.269718170166016
17207/28840	Is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness   They do	21.029266357421875

17230/28840	Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the	40.46388626098633
17231/28840	Will you permit me to inquire said Madame de Villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here   No I do not replied Monte Cristo it is a small place I have purchased quite	23.97147560119629

17239/28840	The count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to	77.69207000732422

17322/28840	I know it sir replied Monte Cristo but when I visit a country I begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear till I know them as well as perhaps better than they know	52.00687789916992
17323/28840	It follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom I should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than I	92.9671401977539
17324/28840	That is to say replied Villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed	67.31746673583984
17325/28840	Faults or crimes responded Monte Cristo with a negligent	62.64546203613281
17326/28840	And that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothersfor you have said so observed Villefort in a tone that faltered somewhatyou alone are	49.90175247192383
17327/28840	No not perfect was the counts reply only impenetrable thats	128.1117401123047
17328/28840	But let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my seconds	55.5478515625
17329/28840	No noby no means said Villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his	46.705970764160156
17330/28840	No by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to	148.16673278808594

17332/28840	I have my pride for menserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under	103.42767333984375
17333/28840	But I lay aside that pride before God who has taken me from nothing to make me what I	52.34389877319336
17334/28840	Then count I admire you said Villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsie	42.96350860595703
17335/28840	Yes and I say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predomin	49.30889129638672
17336/28840	I wish to be Providence myself for I feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and	55.524173736572266

17339/28840	All I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that	47.996337890625
17340/28840	I may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added Monte Crist	48.72328567504883
17341/28840	If the thing were to do again I would again do	88.35997772216797

17344/28840	Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your	189.0567626953125
17345/28840	You say you fear nothing but death   I did not say that I feared it I only said that death alone could check the execution of my	47.78131103515625
17346/28840	And old age   My end will be achieved before I grow	96.1494369506836
17347/28840	And madness   I have been nearly mad and you know the axiom_non bis in idem	35.22240447998047
17348/28840	It is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full	82.55416107177734
17349/28840	30031m       Sir continued Villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and	38.681453704833984
17350/28840	For instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an	76.65821838378906
17351/28840	Come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and I will show you my father	52.93800354003906

17355/28840	Noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning _poor	66.45931243896484

17357/28840	I am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like Providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my	131.50865173339844
17358/28840	A hundred writers since Socrates Seneca	114.31217956542969
17359/28840	Augustine and Gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet I can well understand that a fathers sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a	83.39192962646484
17360/28840	I will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your	38.3497428894043
17361/28840	It would have been so unquestionably had not God given me so large a	88.51537322998047
17362/28840	And what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired Monte Crist	42.182777404785156
17363/28840	My deduction is replied Villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of	76.05916595458984
17364/28840	That God desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him	163.40081787109375
17365/28840	Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard	38.18906784057617
17366/28840	Besides you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Ville	17.644792556762695
17367/28840	The count bowed and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of	37.677555084228516
17368/28840	When he had gone Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh and said   Enough of this poison let me now seek the	50.71284484863281

17370/28840	Haydée   It will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo residing in the Rue Meslay were no other than Maximilian Julie and	28.1866397857666

17372/28840	Haydée had three French maids and one who was a	149.04811096191406
17373/28840	The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her	61.96210479736328
17374/28840	This was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rosecolored	26.290935516357422
17375/28840	Her attitude though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would in a European have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after	135.09764099121094
17376/28840	The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian bell	59.18307113647461
17377/28840	And to complete the whole Haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charmsshe had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty	46.486385345458984
17378/28840	Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his	53.88728713989258
17379/28840	Why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young	62.26408767700195

17386/28840	My poor child replied Monte Cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to	34.74642562866211
17387/28840	I dont want anybody else to talk to	47.36578369140625

17390/28840	He is here and here said she touching her eyes and her	71.2587661743164
17391/28840	And where am I inquired Monte Cristo laugh	62.0061149597168
17392/28840	You cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her	51.07124328613281
17393/28840	You now understand Haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your	78.10772705078125
17394/28840	Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to	66.79901123046875

17400/28840	It is possible Haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the East may not be practicable in	52.40650177001953
17401/28840	Endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome Florence Milan and Madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the	45.50439453125

17414/28840	The carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid	69.56790924072266

17429/28840	Ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your	114.70854187011719
17430/28840	And the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that Monte Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with	27.73760223388672

17469/28840	Maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the counts heart had swelled within him when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and	48.601173400878906
17470/28840	He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden he returned to the	20.377939224243164

17476/28840	We are very happy monsieur replied Julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than	59.38589859008789
17477/28840	The counts features displayed an expression of the most intense	59.226097106933594
17478/28840	Oh all this is a family history as ChâteauRenaud told you the other day observed Maximil	23.94175148010254
17479/28840	This humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrow	64.71558380126953
17480/28840	And God has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said Monte Cristo inquiring	80.59831237792969

17485/28840	No no returned Monte Cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet	23.8260555267334
17486/28840	I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the	64.54170989990234

17495/28840	Ah really said Monte Cristo in a halfstifled	22.384092330932617
17496/28840	Monte Cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of	16.315046310424805
17497/28840	It was the letter written as our readers know to Julie and signed Sinbad the	47.536521911621094
17498/28840	Unknown you say is the man who rendered you this serviceunknown to you   Yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued Maximil	27.322723388671875

17501/28840	He felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address	44.92673873901367
17502/28840	An Englishman said Monte Cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at	40.14451599121094
17503/28840	An Englishman you say   Yes replied Maximilian an Englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French at	18.71955680847168
17504/28840	It was this that made me start when you said the other day at	85.03421020507812
17505/28840	That happened as I told you in 18	75.33151245117188

17507/28840	Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation   Everything is possible in this affair even a	61.14956283569336
17508/28840	What was his name asked Monte Crist	24.12434196472168
17509/28840	He gave no other name answered Julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letterSinbad the	29.362924575805664

17513/28840	Without revealing himself   He was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of	75.6773910522461
17514/28840	And do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired	30.621105194091797
17515/28840	In the name of Heaven said Maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it	18.320314407348633
17516/28840	Alas cried Monte Cristo striving to repress his emotion if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor I fear you will never see him	29.196523666381836

17519/28840	But continued she Lord Wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not   Oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek	60.18186569213867
17520/28840	He was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in	41.82963943481445
17521/28840	And he told you nothing   Not a	28.417234420776367
17522/28840	Nothing that would lead you to suppose  	58.38502883911133

17526/28840	What did your father tell you	65.67683410644531
17527/28840	My father thought that this action had been miraculously performedhe believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save	50.93827819824219
17528/28840	Oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although I did not myself believe it I would not for the world have destroyed my fathers	51.46664810180664
17529/28840	This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man said	15.956669807434082
17530/28840	Yes answered Maximilian but I feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes	29.040578842163086
17531/28840	His voice went to my heart observed Julie and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it	49.69198989868164

17535/28840	At that instant the little sidegate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man	52.50984573364258

17537/28840	After casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the	39.18672561645508

17612/28840	I will come directly cried Valentine	118.46195983886719
17613/28840	The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom Valentines _I am coming_ was the customary signal of	33.87839889526367
17614/28840	Now then said Maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with	19.9293155670166

17760/28840	Yet conscience remains remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled	28.812803268432617
17761/28840	for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward	137.28500366210938

17764/28840	Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to	24.91994285583496
17765/28840	What then is it   A skilful preparation of my friends the worthy Abbé Adelmonte who taught me the use of	18.560956954956055
17766/28840	Oh observed Madame de Villefort it must be an admirable antispasmod	12.790772438049316
17767/28840	Perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and I frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of	50.53425979614258
17768/28840	Most assuredly responded Madame de Villefort in the same	19.37177085876465

17772/28840	They are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutitiona function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplishI prefer my own	57.19984817504883
17773/28840	Undoubtedly and so should I prefer it after the effects I have seen produced but of course it is a secret and I am not so indiscreet as to ask it of	56.91756820678711
17774/28840	But I said Monte Cristo rising as he spokeI am gallant enough to offer it	47.13294982910156
17775/28840	30079m       How kind you	22.02021598815918

17779/28840	The clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of Madame de Villefort who came to dine with	16.176673889160156
17780/28840	A thousand thanks madame replied Monte Cristo but I have an engagement which I cannot	20.76605987548828

17783/28840	Ah in truth madame to do that I must forget the hours conversation I have had with you which is indeed	59.37805938720703

17787/28840	As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost	46.86991882324219
17788/28840	Good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and I feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren	43.186119079589844

17792/28840	Morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus	56.5141487121582
17793/28840	ChâteauRenaud rented a stall beside his own while Beauchamp as a journalist had unlimited range all over the	37.81572723388672
17794/28840	The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a	179.64340209960938
17795/28840	To no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous operabox more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat	59.11351776123047
17796/28840	One must take the world as one finds	223.94998168945312
17797/28840	Surely said Albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the Countess	42.34076690673828
17798/28840	And who is the Countess G inquired ChâteauRen	11.962453842163086
17799/28840	What a question Now do you know baron I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the Countess G	38.34450149536133
17800/28840	Ah to be sure replied ChâteauRenaud the lovely Venetian is it not   Her	15.157686233520508
17801/28840	At this moment the countess perceived Albert and returned his salutation with a	27.970905303955078
17802/28840	You know her it seems said ChâteauRen	37.95233917236328
17803/28840	Franz introduced me to her at Rome replied	241.5601043701172
17804/28840	Well then will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome   With	44.403404235839844
17805/28840	There was a cry of Shut up from the	99.34697723388672
17806/28840	This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their	35.99485397338867
17807/28840	The countess was present at the races in the ChampdeMars said ChâteauRen	12.53420352935791
17808/28840	Bless me I quite forgot the	1169.2445068359375
17809/28840	Did you bet   Oh merely a paltry fifty lou	54.301631927490234
17810/28840	And who was the winner   Naut	59.89104080200195
17811/28840	But there were three races were there not   Yes there was the prize given by the Jockey Cluba gold cup you knowand a very singular circumstance occurred about that	85.91321563720703
17812/28840	What was it   Oh shut up again interposed some of the	65.84337615966797
17813/28840	Why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the	99.15705108642578
17814/28840	Is that possible   True as	161.35658264160156
17815/28840	The fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa or that of a jockey styled Job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting	59.44630432128906
17816/28840	They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riders pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole	86.73030853271484
17817/28840	And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged  	101.25589752197266
17818/28840	You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa   Exactly that was the	42.51629638671875
17819/28840	Then answered Albert I am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse	57.485748291015625
17820/28840	Shut up there cried the pit in	467.34002685546875
17821/28840	And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to	35.99520492553711
17822/28840	At this moment the door of the ministers box opened and Madame Danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by Lucien Debray who assiduously conducted them to their	16.86153221130371
17823/28840	Now barring all that I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl   Handsome certainly replied Albert but not to my taste which I confess inclines to something softer gentler and more	74.49887084960938
17824/28840	And indeed it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the justness of Morcerfs	26.702917098999023
17825/28840	Her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale	98.3010482788086
17826/28840	The rest of Mademoiselle Eugénies person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of Diana as ChâteauRenaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and res	48.8443603515625
17827/28840	As regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a	67.40390014648438
17828/28840	It was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and	48.29498291015625
17829/28840	Still though not actually received at the Hôtel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a govern	58.015262603759766
17830/28840	Morcerf and ChâteauRenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this	18.719480514526367
17831/28840	For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to	38.36166763305664
17832/28840	Be assured replied Albert that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris and had known your address I should have paid my respects to you before	29.939159393310547
17833/28840	Allow me to introduce my friend Baron de ChâteauRenaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the ChampdeMars	25.5015926361084
17834/28840	So you were at the races baron inquired the countess	43.4075927734375
17835/28840	Well then pursued Madame G with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes   I am sorry to say I cannot replied the baron and I was just asking the same question of	42.42595291137695
17836/28840	Are you very anxious to know countess asked	80.8154067993164
17837/28840	Inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsFrom Lord Ruthven to Countess	38.91460037231445
17838/28840	Precisely I was sure of it said Morcer	133.17759704589844
17839/28840	Sure of what   That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven	44.106388092041016
17840/28840	de ChâteauRenaud has also the honor of his	18.03801155090332
17841/28840	And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner   To be sure I remember it all	37.57156753540039
17842/28840	You see its evident where the count got the	179.4980926513672
17843/28840	I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him   I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have	58.115657806396484
17844/28840	Besides his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven   Oh but that is dreadful Why the man must owe me a fearful gr	78.193359375
17845/28840	Does his action appear like that of an enemy   No certainly	65.32038116455078
17846/28840	Well then   And so he is in Paris  	16.414287567138672
17847/28840	And what effect does he produce   Why said Albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of England took place followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Marss diamonds and so people talked of something	52.84054183959961
17848/28840	My good fellow said ChâteauRenaud the count is your friend and you treat him	24.97863006591797
17849/28840	Do not believe what Albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as	43.02267837524414
17850/28840	Perhaps you are right said Morcerf meanwhile who is in the Russian ambassadors box   Which box do you mean asked the count	22.070531845092773
17851/28840	The one between the pillars on the first tierit seems to have been fitted up entirely af	48.25369644165039
17852/28840	Did you observe anyone during the first act asked ChâteauRen	26.71823501586914
17853/28840	No replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize   I am sure of	32.79173278808594
17854/28840	And who afterwards sent the cup to me   Und	90.8648910522461
17855/28840	But I dont know him said the countess I have a great mind to return	27.16655921936035
17856/28840	Do no such thing I beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic	50.941253662109375
17857/28840	It is his way and you must take him as you find	26.533416748046875
17858/28840	At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second	97.1832275390625
17859/28840	Albert rose to return to his	113.42973327636719
17860/28840	Shall I see you again asked the count	26.391700744628906
17861/28840	The young men bowed and quitted the	27.929521560668945
17862/28840	Upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian	77.10731506347656
17863/28840	A man of from thirtyfive to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern	62.17763137817383
17864/28840	The lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon	81.7520523071289
17865/28840	Hullo said Albert it is Monte Cristo and his Greek   The strangers were indeed no other than the count and Hayd	41.26631164550781
17866/28840	In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent	35.81608581542969
17867/28840	The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperintimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary	88.886474609375
17868/28840	At the close of the act he therefore went to the baron	34.942447662353516
17869/28840	Having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to Debr	27.992692947387695
17870/28840	By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while Eugénie received him with her accustomed cold	34.35246658325195
17871/28840	My dear fellow said Debray you have come in the nick of	31.099172592163086
17872/28840	There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is	59.01100540161133
17873/28840	However I have turned the business over to Morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part I care nothing about the count or his mysterious do	64.16761016845703
17874/28840	30093m       I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5000 francs	26.743427276611328
17875/28840	He seems to have a mania for diamonds said Morcerf smiling and I verily believe that like Potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as Tom Thumb did his flint	114.35771179199219
17876/28840	Perhaps he has discovered some mine said Madame Dangl	21.910736083984375
17877/28840	I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the barons banking establishment   I was not aware of it replied Albert but I can readily believe	17.345216751098633
17878/28840	And further that he stated to	404.57098388671875
17879/28840	Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris during which time he proposed to spend six	33.099647521972656

17881/28840	Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman	98.14774322509766
17882/28840	I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded Lucien raising his lorgnette to his	60.67030715942383
17883/28840	A most lovely creature upon my soul was his	208.35780334472656
17884/28840	So I should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as wellinformed as	82.13504791259766
17885/28840	Then your count entertains visitors does he asked Madame Dangl	59.55155944824219
17886/28840	Indeed he does and in a most lavish manner I can assure	30.862794876098633
17887/28840	Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in	37.92266082763672
17888/28840	What said Debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house   Why not my husband could accompany	23.61039161682129
17889/28840	But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor   You have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful	34.70591354370117
17890/28840	No no exclaimed Debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his	59.933204650878906
17891/28840	Do you not recollect Morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast   Well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a	52.96194076538086

17897/28840	I admire all that is beautiful returned the young	66.52139282226562
17898/28840	What do you think of the count inquired Debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good	40.08916473388672
17899/28840	The count repeated Eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully	44.867130279541016
17900/28840	I quite agree with you said Morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find	28.200580596923828
17901/28840	The Countess G insists upon it that he is a	34.64699935913086
17902/28840	Then the Countess G has returned to Paris has she inquired the baron	25.269596099853516
17903/28840	Is that she mamma asked Eugénie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair   Yes said Madame Danglars that is	27.9342098236084
17904/28840	Shall I tell you what you ought to do Morcerf   Command me mad	18.96628189086914
17905/28840	Well then you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to	24.216739654541016
17906/28840	What for Why to converse with him of	117.3435287475586
17907/28840	Have you really no desire to meet him   None whatever replied Eugé	33.51105499267578
17908/28840	He will very probably come of his own accord said Morcer	64.61644744873047
17909/28840	There do you see madame he recognizes you and	81.40769958496094
17910/28840	The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful	32.60491180419922
17911/28840	Well said Morcerf I may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your	52.62236785888672
17912/28840	Adieu I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to	47.26536178588867
17913/28840	Go straight to his box that will be the simplest	115.69633483886719
17914/28840	Presented to whom   To the beautiful	52.33182144165039
17915/28840	You say she is only a slave   While you assert that she is a queen or at least a	32.783164978027344
17916/28840	No I hope that when he sees me leave you he will come	51.44145965576172
17917/28840	I am going said Albert as he made his parting	37.81418228149414
17918/28840	Just as he was passing the counts box the door opened and Monte Cristo came	19.517276763916016
17919/28840	After giving some directions to Ali who stood in the lobby the count took Alberts	45.94723892211914
17920/28840	Carefully closing the box door Ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nub	94.02188873291016
17921/28840	Upon my word said Monte Cristo Paris is a strange city and the Parisians a very singular	50.6562385559082
17922/28840	See that cluster of persons collected around poor Ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever be	122.86652374267578
17923/28840	Now I can promise you that a Frenchman might show himself in public either in Tunis Constantinople Bagdad or Cairo without being treated in that	56.70199203491211
17924/28840	That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of	117.76953887939453
17925/28840	However as far as Ali is concerned I can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in	42.743927001953125
17926/28840	Why if you sought concealment did you call your horse Vampa   That was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera I have been looking for him but without	34.2940673828125
17927/28840	In what part of the house   In the baronesss box I	24.577054977416992
17928/28840	That charming young woman with her is her daughter  	55.72464370727539
17929/28840	We will discuss that subject at length some future time said	113.44692993164062
17930/28840	But what do you think of the music   What music   Why the music you have been listening	20.285364151000977
17931/28840	Oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late Diogen	39.104427337646484
17932/28840	The conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for   No thank	120.98731994628906
17933/28840	To sleep after the manner I speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation   I knowthe famous hashish   Precise	48.055419921875
17934/28840	So my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with	28.317218780517578
17935/28840	I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said Morcer	45.73780059814453
17936/28840	Do you mean at Rome   I	21.910554885864258
17937/28840	Ah then I suppose you heard Haydées guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native	108.87255096435547
17938/28840	Morcerf did not pursue the subject and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent rever	22.084802627563477
17939/28840	The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the	59.75181198120117
17940/28840	You will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his	59.064693450927734
17941/28840	What Are you going   Pray say everything that is kind to Countess G on the part of her friend the	38.66740798950195
17942/28840	And what message shall I convey to the baroness   That with her permission I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the	27.802845001220703
17943/28840	The third act had begun and during its progress the Count of Morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of Madame Dangl	21.320377349853516
17944/28840	The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated	26.594179153442383
17945/28840	The quick eye of Monte Cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his	46.30895233154297
17946/28840	Haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or	69.06890106201172
17947/28840	30099m       The third act passed off as	25.627595901489258
17948/28840	After which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and	70.73167419433594
17949/28840	The count left his box and a moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and	30.385562896728516
17950/28840	You are welcome count she exclaimed as he	124.82513427734375
17951/28840	I have been most anxious to see you that I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill	64.04967498779297
17952/28840	Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your	194.83013916015625
17953/28840	Believe me madame I had entirely forgotten	82.55943298339844
17954/28840	But it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend Madame de Villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to	27.178049087524414
17955/28840	30101m       This time at least I do not deserve your	15.707907676696777
17956/28840	It was Ali my Nubian slave who rendered this service to Madame de Ville	34.99695587158203
17957/28840	May I beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter   Oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied Madame Danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but	22.762651443481445
17958/28840	Eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the Count of Monte Crist	8.03205394744873
17959/28840	The count bowed while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head	13.514960289001465
17960/28840	You have a charming young person with you tonight count said Eugé	59.97960662841797
17961/28840	Is she your daughter   No mademoiselle said Monte Cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the	25.5945987701416
17962/28840	She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my	188.2635955810547
17963/28840	And what is her name   Haydée replied Monte Crist	8.351304054260254
17964/28840	A Greek murmured the Count of Morcer	14.037515640258789
17965/28840	There said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as Haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to Morcerfs	31.094947814941406
17966/28840	It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Med	47.19101333618164
17967/28840	She bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her	47.33776092529297
17968/28840	The sound was heard by the people about Ali who instantly opened the box	95.98878479003906
17969/28840	Why count exclaimed Eugénie what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly	43.93205642700195
17970/28840	But do not be alarmed on her	33.57232666015625
17971/28840	Haydées nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersnay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her	114.70437622070312
17972/28840	However continued Monte Cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket I have an infallible	15.771468162536621
17973/28840	So saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count and left Madame Danglars	17.236955642700195
17974/28840	Upon his return to Haydée he found her still very	55.60042953491211
17975/28840	As soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy	75.0753173828125
17976/28840	Who was it you were talking with over there she	136.8737335205078
17977/28840	With the Count of Morcerf answered Monte Crist	7.701965808868408
17978/28840	He tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to	85.54314422607422
17979/28840	You shall relate them to me my	111.29634857177734
17980/28840	They are no doubt both curious and	383.8194885253906
17981/28840	I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful	70.13761138916016
17982/28840	So saying Haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth	26.6811466217041
17983/28840	Do you observe said the Countess G to Albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of _Robert le Diable_ and when the fourth begins takes his	55.2562255859375
17984/28840	He came to renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed Baronne Danglars _née_ Hermine de Servie	21.994626998901367
17985/28840	Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to	92.15420532226562
17986/28840	He was convinced that Luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chaussée dAnt	20.807537078857422
17987/28840	But the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between Luciens visit and the curiosity of the baron	20.34723663330078
17988/28840	You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars the count inquired of Albert de Morcer	15.271238327026367
17989/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo I did not expect that the affair would be so promptly	17.800813674926758
17990/28840	Oh things take their course without our	101.80010223388672
17991/28840	While we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed	108.61634826660156
17992/28840	Danglars served together in Spain my father in the army and	43.427616119384766
17993/28840	It was there that my father ruined by the revolution and	116.7796401977539
17994/28840	Danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different	28.475923538208008
17995/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo I think	13.209076881408691
17996/28840	Very pretty or rather very beautiful replied Albert but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate I am an ungrateful	59.83463668823242
17997/28840	You speak as if you were already her	119.68531036376953
17998/28840	Ah returned Albert in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was	21.03127670288086
17999/28840	Really said Monte Cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this	15.835654258728027
18000/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me replied Morcerf and that frightens	9.59344482421875
18001/28840	Bah exclaimed Monte Cristo thats a fine reason to	51.1900749206543
18002/28840	Are you not rich yourself   My fathers income is about 50000 francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when I	29.607322692871094
18003/28840	That perhaps might not be considered a large sum in Paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in	51.7020263671875
18004/28840	As for me I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble	23.78574562072754
18005/28840	Albert shook his head and looked	79.43416595458984
18006/28840	There is still something else said	90.29872131347656
18007/28840	I confess observed Monte Cristo that I have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and	32.12285614013672
18008/28840	Oh said Morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my	40.16656494140625
18009/28840	Whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the	163.98092651367188
18010/28840	It is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed	78.90715026855469
18011/28840	I cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Dangl	38.47785186767578
18012/28840	I do not know if that is her reason said Albert but one thing I do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite	28.30711555480957
18013/28840	There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition   Real interrupted the count	50.4626350402832
18014/28840	Oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two	617.3184204101562
18015/28840	I am not yet twentyone and Eugénie is only seventeen but the two months expire next	47.08116149902344
18016/28840	My dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is	82.05683135986328
18017/28840	Marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the	155.9223175048828
18018/28840	Yes replied Morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive	73.2834243774414
18019/28840	Then do not marry her said the	44.07114028930664
18020/28840	Monte Cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last	206.59580993652344
18021/28840	I am doing a little sum in	103.83169555664062
18022/28840	9     When they tell me such things I only shrug my shoulders and say	63.997406005859375
18023/28840	But you were speaking of Haitians said Monte Crist	15.473938941955566
18024/28840	Ah Haitiansthat is quite another thing Haitians are the _écarté_ of French stockjob	36.547630310058594
18025/28840	Danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 franc	30.604312896728516
18026/28840	Had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25	43.28635787963867
18027/28840	And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked Monte Crist	66.95118713378906
18028/28840	I am profoundly ignorant of all these stockjobbing intrig	14.564672470092773
18029/28840	Because said Albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between	102.65005493164062
18030/28840	Ah said the count I see that	22.42521858215332
18031/28840	Danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300000 francs in a day he must be enormously	27.732860565185547
18032/28840	It is not he who plays exclaimed Lucien it is Madame Danglars she is indeed	29.42864990234375
18033/28840	But you who are a reasonable being Lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountainhead surely you ought to prevent it said Morcerf with a	24.51483917236328
18034/28840	How can I if her husband fails in controlling her asked Lucien you know the character of the baronessno one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she ple	42.622440338134766
18035/28840	Ah if I were in your place said	44.147945404052734
18036/28840	Well   I would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future sonin	38.838829040527344
18037/28840	How would you set about it   Ah that would be easy enoughI would give her a	31.54310417175293
18038/28840	Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your	99.2269058227539
18039/28840	Cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prud	41.84433364868164
18040/28840	It is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheardof piece of intelligencesome telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that Henri	75.18577575683594
18041/28840	We can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the PontNe	29.864452362060547
18042/28840	Monte Cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the	75.31764221191406
18043/28840	This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at	107.30988311767578
18044/28840	The count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered Willingly count I	60.744991302490234
18045/28840	Do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of	36.08564376831055
18046/28840	Debray   My dear count said Morcerf I beg of you not to apply that title so	15.0513334274292
18047/28840	Now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage   So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not I think visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole	42.27407455444336
18048/28840	Then said the count I am emboldened to speak openly to	23.308914184570312
18049/28840	de Villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render	27.695547103881836
18050/28840	I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and rout	82.44625091552734
18051/28840	Now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them I have if agreeable to you thought of inviting	140.428955078125
18052/28840	and Madame de Villefort to my countryhouse at Auteu	13.931396484375
18053/28840	In that case your mother would hold me in aversion and I do not at all wish that on the contrary I desire to stand high in her	60.1330451965332
18054/28840	Indeed count said Morcerf I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you	38.748050689697266

18058/28840	But to return to what we were	55.294734954833984

18060/28840	Well said he to Morcerf but I think your father will not be the only angry one	25.557146072387695
18061/28840	and Madame Danglars will think me a very illmannered	29.120624542236328
18062/28840	They know that I am intimate with youthat you are in fact one of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintancesand they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why I did not invite	34.912654876708984
18063/28840	Be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in	134.77984619140625
18064/28840	You know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be	239.5340118408203

18080/28840	She is a remarkable woman and I only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case I assure you there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcer	35.56904602050781
18081/28840	As to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referend	33.09892272949219

18086/28840	Ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an	118.42988586425781
18087/28840	I require the proof of a preeng	46.835113525390625
18088/28840	I am not a banker like	47.47637176513672
18089/28840	Danglars but I am quite as incredulous as he	12.893614768981934
18090/28840	I am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the	17.622360229492188
18091/28840	Humph said Morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid	33.8073844909668

18094/28840	I had no previous knowledge of your visit had I   Indeed you are such an extraordinary person that I would not answer for	35.47762680053711
18095/28840	At all events I could not guess that you would invite me to	38.51118469238281
18096/28840	Well listen Baptistin what did I tell you this morning when I called you into my laboratory   To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the val	37.937625885009766

18101/28840	The major will bring his son with him this evening the _contino_ as we say in Italy he confides him to my	72.6340103149414

18105/28840	He is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in Italy descendants of very ancient	98.36701202392578
18106/28840	I have met him several times at Florence Bologna and Lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in	30.066064834594727
18107/28840	This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire when he was on his way to	32.899269104003906

18112/28840	He says you were the sun of Rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it	58.45506286621094
18113/28840	His opinion of me is altered for the better then   No he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of	108.20614624023438
18114/28840	He is a charming young man said Monte Cristo and I felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when I met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of	33.801597595214844
18115/28840	He is I think the son of General dÉpinay   He	11.463119506835938
18116/28840	The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815   By the Bonapart	52.56888198852539
18117/28840	Really I like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him   Yes he is to marry Mademoiselle de Ville	21.373706817626953

18119/28840	Why do you do so   I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my	38.778011322021484
18120/28840	But really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is unpardon	98.06526947021484

18123/28840	And your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about	110.73516845703125
18124/28840	Monsieur Baptistin especially I could never get such a man as	33.41569137573242
18125/28840	My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner	112.36405181884766
18126/28840	Baptistin give me the refusal of	823.6735229492188
18127/28840	Ah ha you will do as much as that will you  	71.18109893798828

18130/28840	Nothing is impossible gravely replied Monte Cristo and taking leave of Albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three	48.59862518310547
18131/28840	Monsieur Bertuccio you understand that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteu	19.04106330871582
18132/28840	I shall require your services to see that all be properly	76.296142578125
18133/28840	It is a beautiful house or at all events may be made	38.21185302734375
18134/28840	There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very	59.976261138916016
18135/28840	Let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleepingchamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it	57.01502990722656

18138/28840	I should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the	32.739891052246094
18139/28840	Bertuccio said the count since you have been in Paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand	38.47517395019531
18140/28840	But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   I do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do	30.133630752563477
18141/28840	Lucullus dines with Lucullus that is quite	57.936279296875
18142/28840	Major Cavalcanti   Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining Alberts	31.97980308532715
18143/28840	Seven oclock had just struck and	85.63787078857422
18144/28840	Bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for Auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its	38.96540451049805
18145/28840	The visitor was about fiftytwo years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over	24.74102210998535
18146/28840	Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at	30.588577270507812
18147/28840	30 in the Avenue des ChampsÉlysées that the Count of Monte Cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the	15.307143211364746
18148/28840	The small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the	39.076534271240234
18149/28840	Therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his	37.51133346557617
18150/28840	He was ushered into a simple and elegant drawingroom and the count rose to meet him with a smiling	33.999820709228516
18151/28840	Ah my dear sir you are most welcome I was expecting	39.446754455566406
18152/28840	Indeed said the Italian was your excellency then aware of my visit   Yes I had been told that I should see you today at seven o	23.487199783325195
18153/28840	Then you have received full information concerning my arrival   Of	51.53413009643555
18154/28840	Ah so much the better I feared this little precaution might have been	51.584171295166016
18155/28840	30119m       What precaution   That of informing you beforehand of my	24.853899002075195
18156/28840	But you are sure you are not	18.182485580444336
18157/28840	It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening   I will prove it to you beyond a	45.1503791809082
18158/28840	Oh no never mind that said the Italian it is not worth the	62.23885726928711
18159/28840	Let me see said the count are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti   Bartolomeo Cavalcanti joyfully replied the Italian yes I am really	13.099328994750977
18160/28840	Exmajor in the Austrian service   Was I a major timidly asked the old	53.722843170166016
18161/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo you were a major that is the title the French give to the post which you filled in	49.4483642578125
18162/28840	Very good said the major I do not demand more you understand   Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said Monte Crist	45.81074905395508
18163/28840	You were sent by some other person  	38.8649787902832
18164/28840	By the excellent Abbé Busoni   Exactly so said the delighted	20.977928161621094
18165/28840	And you have a letter   Yes there it	21.510353088378906
18166/28840	And Monte Cristo took the letter which he opened and	16.611366271972656
18167/28840	The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the	21.19695472717285
18168/28840	Major Cavalcanti a worthy patrician of Lucca a descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence continued Monte Cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a	39.46282196044922
18169/28840	Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper and	54.929866790771484
18170/28840	Half a million said he magnificent   Half a million is it said the	61.88099670410156
18171/28840	Yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in	34.846649169921875
18172/28840	Be it half a million then but on my word of honor I had no idea that it was so	38.86561584472656
18173/28840	Because you are robbed by your stew	66.28594207763672
18174/28840	You must make some reformation in that	106.37405395507812
18175/28840	You have opened my eyes said the Italian gravely I will show the gentlemen the	87.62625122070312
18176/28840	Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter   And who only needs one thing more to make him	54.868953704833984
18177/28840	Yes indeed but one said the major with a	41.8792839050293
18178/28840	Which is to recover a lost and adored	190.0395965576172
18179/28840	A lost and adored son   Stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gyps	48.10745620727539
18180/28840	At the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to	29.02617073059082
18181/28840	The count continued   I have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen	34.70771026611328
18182/28840	The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of	7.273673057556152
18183/28840	I have the power of so doing said Monte Crist	14.697534561157227
18184/28840	Ah true said Monte Cristo there is a post	13.815463066101074
18185/28840	In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker I send him a draft for 2000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48000 francs which you still owe	33.171199798583984
18186/28840	The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great	114.15606689453125
18187/28840	He said very good muttered the major thensir replied	486.86407470703125
18188/28840	Then the postscript   Well what of the postscript   Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter   Certainly the Abbé Busoni and myself have a small account open between	27.47440528869629
18189/28840	I do not remember if it is exactly 48000 francs which I am still owing him but I dare say we shall not dispute the	33.76227951049805
18190/28840	Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said Monte Crist	48.40046691894531
18191/28840	Why really I know no one said the	38.39981460571289
18192/28840	But then you yourself are known to others   Yes I am known so that   Proceed my dear Monsieur Cavalc	34.270668029785156
18193/28840	So that you will remit to me these 48000 francs   Certainly at your first	24.402225494384766
18194/28840	The majors eyes dilated with pleasing aston	70.912353515625
18195/28840	But sit down said Monte Cristo really I do not know what I have been thinking ofI have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an	26.360244750976562
18196/28840	The major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat	32.52278518676758
18197/28840	Now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or Alicante   Alicante if you please it is my favorite	35.98168182373047

18202/28840	Into what room did you take him   Into the blue drawingroom according to your excellencys	45.80080795288086
18203/28840	Thats right now bring the Alicante and some	463.6626892089844
18204/28840	Really said the major I am quite ashamed of the trouble I am giving	23.697702407836914
18205/28840	Pray dont mention such a thing said the	123.82587432861328
18206/28840	Baptistin reentered with glasses wine and	399.5716857910156
18207/28840	The count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored	62.57303237915039
18208/28840	The bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans	83.78824615478516
18209/28840	The major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a bisc	90.67500305175781
18210/28840	The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the	41.23118591308594
18211/28840	30123m       So sir you lived at Lucca did you You were rich noble held in great esteemhad all that could render a man happy   All said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively	56.05302429199219
18212/28840	And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness   Only one thing said the	37.93684768676758
18213/28840	And that one thing your lost	371.2010192871094
18214/28840	Ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed	39.15898132324219
18215/28840	The worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and	31.824905395507812
18216/28840	Let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for I always understood you were a	121.35688018798828
18217/28840	That was the general opinion sir said the major and I   Yes replied the count and you confirmed the	32.52878952026367
18218/28840	Yes said the major I did wish this fault to be hidden from every	71.66781616210938
18219/28840	Not on your own account surely replied Monte Cristo for a man is above that sort of thing   Oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the	23.300020217895508
18220/28840	But for the sake of the mother said the	27.709430694580078
18221/28840	Yes for the mothers sakehis poor mother cried the major taking a third bisc	72.46678161621094
18222/28840	Take some more wine my dear Cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante your emotion has quite overcome	46.34537887573242
18223/28840	His poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false	49.38258361816406
18224/28840	She belonged to one of the first families in Italy I think did she not   She was of a noble family of Fiesole	54.81356430053711
18225/28840	And her name was   Do you desire to know her name   Oh said Monte Cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for I already know	15.721293449401855
18226/28840	The count knows everything said the Italian b	53.72905731201172
18227/28840	Oliva Corsinari was it not   Oliva Corsinari   A marchioness   A marchioness   And you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family   Yes that was the way it	18.716632843017578
18228/28840	And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said Monte Crist	32.0388298034668
18229/28840	What papers   The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari and the register of your childs	25.096132278442383
18230/28840	The register of my childs birth   The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcantiof your son is not his name Andrea   I believe so said the	43.16283416748047
18231/28840	What You believe so   I dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a	29.752958297729492
18232/28840	Well then said Monte Cristo you have all the documents with you   Your excellency I regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers I neglected to bring	24.13074493408203
18233/28840	Were they then so necessary   They were	200.98587036132812
18234/28840	The major passed his hand across his	23.847923278808594
18235/28840	Ah _perbacco_ indispensable were they   Certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child   True said the major there might be doubts	46.3899040222168
18236/28840	In that case your son would be very unpleasantly	41.84373474121094
18237/28840	It would be fatal to his	89.65802001953125
18238/28840	It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial	45.921600341796875
18239/28840	_O peccato_   You must know that in France they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in Italy to go to the priest and say We love each other and want you to marry	59.85655212402344
18240/28840	Marriage is a civil affair in France and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your	69.30303955078125
18241/28840	That is the misfortune You see I have not these necessary	151.71665954589844
18242/28840	Fortunately I have them though said Monte Crist	36.443721771240234
18243/28840	You have them   I have	33.383750915527344
18244/28840	I do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything but happily the Abbé Busoni thought for	57.10999298095703
18245/28840	He is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you   Here they	18.401567459106445
18246/28840	The major clasped his hands in token of	15.734103202819824
18247/28840	You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del MonteCattini here is the priests	37.46892547607422
18248/28840	Yes indeed there it is truly said the Italian looking on with aston	58.667423248291016
18249/28840	And here is Andrea Cavalcantis baptismal register given by the curé of Sarave	20.165475845336914
18250/28840	Take these documents then they do not concern	64.67510223388672
18251/28840	You will give them to your son who will of course take great care of	40.24221420288086
18252/28840	I should think so indeed If he were to lose them   Well and if he were to lose them said Monte Crist	23.687477111816406
18253/28840	In that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be	28.177642822265625
18254/28840	It would be a difficult matter to arrange said Monte Crist	22.039527893066406
18255/28840	I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these	18.030925750732422
18256/28840	Now said Monte Cristo as to the mother of the young man   As to the mother of the young man repeated the Italian with	19.77628517150879
18257/28840	I knew that said Monte Cristo she has been dead these ten	43.409786224365234
18258/28840	And I am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right	64.69595336914062
18259/28840	What would you have said Monte Cristo we are all	33.3509407043457
18260/28840	Now you understand my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen	20.21599769592285
18261/28840	Stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be	45.499305725097656
18262/28840	You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian	43.67218780517578
18263/28840	That is the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio where you have lived since the death of your	34.52252960205078
18264/28840	If they should hear of the separation   Ah yes what could I say   That an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family   By the Corsinari   Precise	41.828800201416016
18265/28840	Had stolen away this child in order that your name might become	216.4656524658203
18266/28840	That is reasonable since he is an only	90.79420471191406
18267/28840	Well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be	82.62792205810547
18268/28840	You have doubtless already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you   An agreeable one asked the	85.09988403320312
18269/28840	Ah I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his	50.36106491088867
18270/28840	Someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was	84.73974609375
18271/28840	That who was here   Your childyour sonyour Andrea   I did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible cool	53.69517135620117
18272/28840	Then he is here   He is said Monte Cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his	14.438069343566895
18273/28840	Ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each ex	51.2775993347168
18274/28840	My dear sir said Monte Cristo I understand your emotion you must have time to recover	25.041460037231445
18275/28840	I will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this muchdesired interview for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than	46.47597885131836
18276/28840	I should quite imagine that to be the case said Cavalc	26.52821922302246
18277/28840	Well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with	15.708015441894531
18278/28840	You will bring him then You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself   No I do not wish to come between a father and	48.32265090942383
18279/28840	But do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this	94.94547271728516
18280/28840	He is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for	54.81610107421875
18281/28840	By the way said the major you know I have only the 2000 francs which the Abbé Busoni sent me this sum I have expended upon travelling expenses and   And you want money that is a matter of course my dear	25.477752685546875
18282/28840	Well here are 8000 francs on	47.537044525146484
18283/28840	It is 40000 francs which I now owe you said Monte Crist	18.12454605102539
18284/28840	Does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his	27.86674690246582
18285/28840	I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Bus	21.66347312927246
18286/28840	Well when you receive the remaining 40000 you shall give me a receipt in	53.333343505859375
18287/28840	Between honest men such excessive precaution is I think quite	223.2882537841797
18288/28840	Yes so it is between perfectly upright	616.4048461914062
18289/28840	You will permit me to make one remark   Certainly pray do	28.78765869140625
18290/28840	Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of	79.90381622314453
18291/28840	Indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete	17.50979995727539
18292/28840	It may be worn at Via Reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in	88.7889633178711
18293/28840	Oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave	35.168426513671875
18294/28840	But what shall I wear   What you find in your tr	67.8191146850586
18295/28840	In my trunks I have but one portmante	25.774093627929688
18296/28840	I dare say you have nothing else with	43.583396911621094
18297/28840	What is the use of boring ones self with so many things Besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as	50.338748931884766
18298/28840	But you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before	41.947322845458984
18299/28840	It has arrived at the Hôtel des Princes Rue de Richel	10.322766304016113
18300/28840	It is there you are to take up your	56.79667663574219
18301/28840	Then in these trunks   I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to needyour plain clothes and your	35.7036018371582
18302/28840	On grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very	149.6548614501953
18303/28840	They still laugh at them in France and yet always wear them for all	114.57100677490234
18304/28840	Very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the	41.67550277709961
18305/28840	Now said Monte Cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear	49.348785400390625
18306/28840	Saying which Monte Cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the	46.6391716003418
18307/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti   The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room which Baptistin had designated as the drawingroom and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour	24.552309036254883
18308/28840	Baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for adm	88.73482513427734
18309/28840	He was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to	52.26243209838867
18310/28840	When the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the goldheaded cane which he held in his	19.523160934448242
18311/28840	On perceiving the count he rose	82.4278564453125
18312/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo I believe said	11.409274101257324
18313/28840	Yes sir and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea Cavalcanti   Count Andrea Cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a	9.601329803466797
18314/28840	You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the	27.096235275268555
18315/28840	I did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so	47.57313537597656
18316/28840	The letter signed Sinbad the Sailor is it not   Exactly	10.427207946777344
18317/28840	Ah indeed Then that explains everything that is extraordinary said	188.34378051757812
18318/28840	He is then the same Englishman whom I metatahyes	87.4565658569336
18319/28840	Well monsieur I am at your	9.071188926696777
18320/28840	If what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family   Certainly I will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready	23.483341217041016
18321/28840	I am as you have said the Count Andrea Cavalcanti son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti a descendant of the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at	17.90274429321289
18322/28840	Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master I have been constantly seeking him but all in	82.64813995361328
18323/28840	At length I received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in Paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting	49.2017822265625
18324/28840	Really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said Monte Cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend Sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking	33.93342590332031
18325/28840	The expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now	22.295671463012695
18326/28840	Ah yes that is the name	215.87924194335938
18327/28840	And you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here   Yes sir and I can even add that I have only just left his	18.60409164428711
18328/28840	The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic	88.52668762207031
18329/28840	At length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of	50.04487991333008
18330/28840	Your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of Piedmont with a passport signed for	72.27098083496094
18331/28840	You were in the south of France I think   Yes replied Andrea with an embarrassed air I was in the south of	23.489578247070312
18332/28840	30133m       Indeed Then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this	35.446468353271484
18333/28840	But said Andrea if my father had met me I doubt if he would have recognized me I must be somewhat altered since he last saw	60.32713317871094
18334/28840	Oh the voice of nature said Monte Crist	46.51570129394531
18335/28840	True interrupted the young man I had not looked upon it in that	34.45821762084961
18336/28840	Sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded I hope no false report   As for myself I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore the philanthrop	41.53159713745117
18337/28840	I believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for I did not ask not being inquis	51.166221618652344
18338/28840	Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been	52.59659957885742
18339/28840	He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found	33.998104095458984
18340/28840	He did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future	69.68257904052734
18341/28840	I am quite aware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and I have promised to adhere to his	39.416038513183594
18342/28840	Now sir pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your	44.26172637939453
18343/28840	I have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in Asia Minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman	39.93721389770508
18344/28840	Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from	64.78764343261719
18345/28840	Besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette I suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my	44.30125427246094
18346/28840	Well said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if I were you I would not divulge a word of these	32.63906478881836
18347/28840	Your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like	87.26444244384766
18348/28840	This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to represent to you my dear	43.589759826660156

18350/28840	You would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the	52.20487594604492
18351/28840	You might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant	65.6782455444336
18352/28840	I agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely	20.587831497192383
18353/28840	Nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said Monte Cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into	44.60061264038086
18354/28840	You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former	78.35486602783203
18355/28840	However your excellency said Andrea in consideration of Lord Wilmore by whom I was recommended to you   Yes certainly interrupted Monte Cristo but Lord Wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear	19.799516677856445
18356/28840	Andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy	260.884765625

18358/28840	He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the Austrian service all that will be pard	30.430301666259766
18359/28840	We are not generally very severe with the Aust	74.72000885009766
18360/28840	In short you will find your father a very presentable person I assure	69.52025604248047
18361/28840	Ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that I have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all	35.26346969604492
18362/28840	He is a millionairehis income is 500000 franc	20.56111717224121
18363/28840	Then said the young man with anxiety I shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable	22.114681243896484
18364/28840	One of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of 50000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in	25.0961971282959

18368/28840	Shall I receive it from my father asked Andrea with some uneas	51.74943542480469
18369/28840	Yes you will receive it from your father personally but Lord Wilmore will be the security for the	44.573482513427734

18379/28840	Andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining	58.02400588989258
18380/28840	The young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching	29.555879592895508
18381/28840	Ah my dear father said Andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you   How do you do my dear son said the major grave	21.968778610229492
18382/28840	After so many years of painful separation said Andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again   Indeed it is after so long a	40.883506774902344

18384/28840	30139m       If you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the others	28.43694496154785
18385/28840	Then we are once more reunited said	80.89818572998047

18387/28840	The fact is said the young man that I should be exceedingly grieved to leave	33.162384033203125
18388/28840	As for me you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I	36.267364501953125
18389/28840	But before you leave France my dear father I hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my	40.16530990600586
18390/28840	Certainly I am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but I had resolved on giving them into your hands and if I had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my	42.6649055480957
18391/28840	Where are these papers then   Here they	36.934906005859375
18392/28840	Whywhat do you mean by that question   I mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as	24.69770622253418
18393/28840	In France my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to Toulon for five years for change of	61.415977478027344
18394/28840	Will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest	50.227935791015625
18395/28840	Make yourself easy we are quite alone said Andrea besides we are conversing in	67.64303588867188
18396/28840	Well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs	47.87349319458008
18397/28840	Monsieur Cavalcanti said Andrea do you believe in fairy tales   I used not to do so but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith in	21.4888858795166
18398/28840	You have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth The major drew from his pocket a handful of	36.65933609008789
18399/28840	Most palpable proofs said he as you may	232.1244659423828

18403/28840	Whom do you mean by they   _Ma foi_ I can hardly tell but I was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not  	30.662704467773438
18404/28840	From whom   From a certain Abbé Bus	17.038564682006836

18407/28840	Then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans	66.14010620117188

18419/28840	And what did the letter contain   Read	49.55387496948242

18430/28840	At all events it is neither you nor	59.75303649902344
18431/28840	Well then   Why it does not much concern us do you think it does   No I agree with you	23.216646194458008

18437/28840	Well marquis said Monte Cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to	39.34912109375
18438/28840	Ah your excellency I am overwhelmed with	24.56806755065918

18441/28840	Happy father happy son said the	175.50949096679688
18442/28840	There is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so	54.435237884521484
18443/28840	Cavalcanti I trust you will not leave before I have had the honor of presenting you to some of my	45.201480865478516

18472/28840	At what hour shall we come asked the young	47.21142578125
18473/28840	We will be with you at that time said the	24.998428344726562
18474/28840	The two Cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the	15.101339340209961
18475/28840	Monte Cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in	61.007293701171875
18476/28840	There go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related Then after an instant of gloomy reflection Come I will go to see the Morrels said he I think that disgust is even more sickening than	84.19247436523438
18477/28840	In the Lucern Patch   Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding	46.90185546875
18478/28840	de Villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our	37.03926467895508
18479/28840	This time Maximilian was the first to	37.314842224121094
18480/28840	He was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel	64.32605743408203
18481/28840	At length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching	88.4888687133789
18482/28840	The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was	24.325477600097656
18483/28840	The young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comfort	47.29090118408203
18484/28840	It is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man Valentine did not suffer by the	47.835487365722656
18485/28840	In about half an hour the girls went away and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars visit had at last come to an	22.47890281677246
18486/28840	In a few minutes Valentine reentered the garden	42.065826416015625
18487/28840	Goodevening Maximilian I know I have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my	41.79202651977539
18488/28840	I was not aware that you were so intimate with	15.466620445251465
18489/28840	Who told you we were intimate Maximilian   No one but you appeared to be	28.66829490661621
18490/28840	From the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each	63.973670959472656
18491/28840	We were having a confidential conversation returned Valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with	58.71052551269531
18492/28840	de Morcerf and I on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying	45.80526351928711
18493/28840	Dear Valentine   That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and Eugénie as in speaking of the man whom I could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were	39.22285461425781
18494/28840	Ah how good you are to say so Valentine You possess a quality which can never belong to Mademoiselle Dangl	23.15116310119629
18495/28840	It is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we	79.1753158569336
18496/28840	It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that	70.95002746582031
18497/28840	No Valentine I assure you such is not the	72.95404815673828
18498/28840	I was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars I cannot understand how any man can really love	26.446495056152344
18499/28840	The fact is Maximilian that I was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your	60.94803237915039
18500/28840	No but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle Danglars   I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to	23.569480895996094
18501/28840	It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted	116.20427703857422
18502/28840	You cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each	50.07988739013672

18508/28840	Ah you see   Well what does that prove asked	69.13114166259766
18509/28840	Then why did you smile   Why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself	36.08955764770508
18510/28840	Do you want me to go away   Ah no	25.49474334716797
18511/28840	But do not let us lose time you are the subject on which I wish to	30.782699584960938
18512/28840	True we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass	55.3784065246582
18513/28840	Yes you are right I am but a poor friend to	21.481847763061523
18514/28840	What a life I cause you to lead poor Maximilian you who are formed for happiness I bitterly reproach myself I assure	78.85836029052734
18515/28840	You must hope for us both Maximilian that will make me at least partly	73.04562377929688
18516/28840	But why must you leave me so soon   I do not know	37.76797103881836
18517/28840	I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune	30.953432083129883
18518/28840	Let them take my fortune I am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quiet	81.32664489746094
18519/28840	You would love me as much if I were poor would you not Maximilian   Oh I shall always love	27.719654083251953
18520/28840	What should I care for either riches or poverty if my Valentine was near me and I felt certain that no one could deprive me of her But do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage   I do not think that is the	33.497657775878906
18521/28840	However it may be Valentine you must not be	38.78483581542969
18522/28840	I assure you that as long as I live I shall never love anyone else   Do you think to reassure me when you say that Maximilian   Pardon me you are	18.90096664428711
18523/28840	But I was going to tell you that I met	15.250143051147461
18524/28840	Well   Monsieur Franz is his friend you	21.089298248291016
18525/28840	What then   Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz announcing his immediate	19.535327911376953
18526/28840	Valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the	30.306989669799805
18527/28840	Ah heavens if it were that But no the communication would not come through Madame de Ville	67.28495788574219
18528/28840	Why not   BecauseI scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if Madame de Villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose	42.2535285949707
18529/28840	Is it so Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Ville	36.7068977355957
18530/28840	Do not be in such a hurry to do that said Valentine with a sad	33.10041427612305
18531/28840	If she objects to your marrying	638.94677734375
18532/28840	dÉpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other	39.92724609375
18533/28840	No Maximilian it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects it is marriage	54.724246978759766
18534/28840	Marriage If she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself   You do not understand me Maximil	35.18302536010742
18535/28840	About a year ago I talked of retiring to a	79.65106964111328
18536/28840	Madame de Villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the	31.840700149536133
18537/28840	You can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and I had almost said by whom he is beloved in	56.15636444091797
18538/28840	When he learned my resolution I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless	65.07686614990234
18539/28840	Ah Maximilian I experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet I exclaimedForgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me I will never leave	47.0578498840332
18540/28840	When I had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a	24.512495040893555
18541/28840	Ah Maximilian I may have much to suffer but I feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for	37.21259307861328
18542/28840	Noirtier evidently intends making me his	133.66014099121094
18543/28840	My brother Edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with	92.57935333251953

18545/28840	Ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avar	42.04741287231445
18546/28840	It is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal	88.21343231201172
18547/28840	No human being not even my sister is aware of its	95.47742462158203
18548/28840	Valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you   Valentine	25.766855239868164
18549/28840	A friend Maximilian and who is this friend I tremble to give my	66.42313385009766
18550/28840	Well that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first saw that extraordinary	74.2012710571289
18551/28840	Extraordinary did you say  	122.92764282226562
18552/28840	You have known him for some time then   Scarcely longer than eight or ten	33.596187591552734
18553/28840	And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days Ah Maximilian I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of	62.02226257324219
18554/28840	Your logic is most powerful Valentine but say what you will I can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my	100.93648529052734
18555/28840	He must be a prophet then said Valentine	80.23361206054688
18556/28840	Indeed said Maximilian I have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future	38.164466857910156
18557/28840	Ah said Valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man Maximilian he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all I have	31.44898223876953
18558/28840	My poor girl you know him	141.837890625
18559/28840	I know him   Yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her	14.962115287780762
18560/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo   The	6.54495906829834
18561/28840	Ah cried Valentine he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort ever to be	40.504878997802734
18562/28840	The friend of Madame de Villefort It cannot be surely Valentine you are mistaken   No indeed I am not for I assure you his power over our household is almost	33.90572738647461
18563/28840	de Monte Cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our	37.158592224121094
18564/28840	If such be the case my dear Valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his	58.1142463684082
18565/28840	This man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and	137.60365295410156
18566/28840	I never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnific	159.5557403564453
18567/28840	His smile is so sweet when he addresses me that I forget it ever can be bitter to	106.7279281616211
18568/28840	Ah Valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if so depend on it you will be	48.61049270629883
18569/28840	Me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if I accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid	71.08714294433594
18570/28840	You say he loves you Maximilian how do you know that he does All would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with	53.56626892089844
18571/28840	Ah Valentine I assure you you are	42.1861686706543
18572/28840	Who knows but that in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power It is not just that he should despise me so without any	35.23922348022461
18573/28840	Ah forgive me said Valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on Maximilian I have done wrong for I have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know existed in my	33.44456100463867
18574/28840	I do not deny the influence of which you speak or that I have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than	45.71039581298828
18575/28840	Well Valentine said Morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter	21.67983055114746
18576/28840	I will not make a confidant of	11.790349960327148
18577/28840	Alas said Valentine I see that I have given you	24.215198516845703
18578/28840	I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved	51.614864349365234
18579/28840	But indeed I am not prejudiced beyond the power of	35.4704704284668
18580/28840	Tell me what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for	23.1120662689209
18581/28840	30157m       I own that your question embarrasses me Valentine for I cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible	27.18807029724121
18582/28840	Still as I have already told you I have an instinctive affection for him the source of which I cannot explain to	17.74396514892578
18583/28840	Has the sun done anything for me No he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that I see younothing	114.90211486816406
18584/28840	Has such and such a perfume done anything for me No its odor charms one of my sensesthat is all I can say when I am asked why I praise	95.11608123779297
18585/28840	My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for	95.07508850097656
18586/28840	A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of	51.65760803222656
18587/28840	In his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts I find a relation to my	69.03936004638672
18588/28840	You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that ever since I have known this man I have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from	32.244083404541016
18589/28840	However I have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my	83.2875747680664
18590/28840	He invited me to dine with him on Saturday which was a very natural thing for him to	31.25420570373535
18591/28840	Well what have I learned since That your mother and	123.92806243896484
18592/28840	de Villefort are both coming to this	102.25190734863281
18593/28840	I shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless I perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the	69.06079864501953
18594/28840	I believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet	55.322662353515625
18595/28840	and Madame de Villefort and sometimes I confess I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our	24.195541381835938
18596/28840	My good friend said Valentine I should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if I were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to	44.44062805175781
18597/28840	Is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting Pray reflect a	65.54255676269531
18598/28840	I feel the same as regards	70.20165252685547
18599/28840	said Valentine and I own that if you have no stronger proof to give me   I have another replied Maximilian but I fear you will deem it even more absurd than the	34.30884552001953
18600/28840	So much the worse said Valentine	82.05968475341797
18601/28840	It is nevertheless conclusive to my	79.37198638916016
18602/28840	Dear Maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety When you are away I no longer pray for myself but for	88.4172134399414
18603/28840	30159m       Yes since you have known me said Morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance	23.42302894592285
18604/28840	You are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be	66.47427368164062
18605/28840	Well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which I rode	77.5256118774414
18606/28840	Ah what a beautiful creature cried Valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that I could talk to him and pat him   He is as you see a very valuable animal said Maximil	38.519920349121094
18607/28840	You know that my means are limited and that I am what would be designated a man of moderate pret	98.00057220458984
18608/28840	Well I went to a horse dealers where I saw this magnificent horse which I have named Médé	29.668380737304688
18609/28840	I asked the price they told me it was 4500 franc	37.35087203979492
18610/28840	The same evening some friends of mine visited me	379.38043212890625
18611/28840	Debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by	39.566566467285156
18612/28840	I never play for I am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to	63.555294036865234
18613/28840	But I was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which I	34.59298324584961
18614/28840	Just as they were sitting down to table	54.29701232910156
18615/28840	He took his seat amongst them they played and I	255.67063903808594
18616/28840	I am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5000 franc	29.31593894958496
18617/28840	I could not defer my pleasure so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse	35.52471160888672
18618/28840	Feverish and excited I rang at the	540.494140625
18619/28840	The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for I rushed at once to the	54.54243850708008
18620/28840	Médéah was standing at the rack eating his	119.5044174194336
18621/28840	As I rode by the counts house I perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the	33.69994354248047
18622/28840	Now Valentine I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring	72.94611358642578
18623/28840	My dear Maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me	75.83539581298828
18624/28840	A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common everyday sort of attachment such as	75.23641204833984
18625/28840	Do you hear   Ah Valentine said Maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that I may have the happiness of kissing	46.94402313232422
18626/28840	Maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two	99.24237823486328
18627/28840	Shall you be happy if I do what you wish   Oh yes   Valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the	33.223297119140625
18628/28840	Maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned	31.57745361328125
18629/28840	The little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own	34.69697570800781
18630/28840	de Villefort entered his fathers room followed by Madame de Ville	9.793944358825684
18631/28840	Both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to Barrois a faithful servant who had been twentyfive years in his service took their places on either side of the paraly	26.769556045532227
18632/28840	Noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at	35.133018493652344
18633/28840	He was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around	45.457237243652344
18634/28840	Noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official	50.75845718383789
18635/28840	He commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were	293.6184387207031
18636/28840	Three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were Villefort Valentine and the old servant of whom we have already	53.1695556640625
18637/28840	But as Villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his	52.55844497680664
18638/28840	Valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in Noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his	35.015960693359375
18639/28840	Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to	41.597564697265625
18640/28840	As we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so	45.51921844482422
18641/28840	Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to	18.38043975830078
18642/28840	Noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary Villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans	30.93746566772461
18643/28840	This communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approb	75.03799438476562
18644/28840	The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing	52.54759216308594
18645/28840	Sir resumed Villefort we are thinking of marrying	28.418190002441406
18646/28840	Had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced	101.31632232666016
18647/28840	The marriage will take place in less than three months said Ville	25.61663818359375
18648/28840	Noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate	75.24922180175781
18649/28840	It is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely happyhis name moreover cannot be wholly unknown to	49.629215240478516
18650/28840	While his wife was speaking Villefort had narrowly watched the old mans count	24.732778549194336

18652/28840	Noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his	28.620380401611328
18653/28840	The procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between	47.316654205322266
18654/28840	Noirtier and the elder dÉpinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his	78.08348083496094
18655/28840	Sir said he you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable	36.47203826904297
18656/28840	Villefort quietly opened a window saying It is very warm and the heat affects	53.544334411621094
18657/28840	He then returned to his place but did not sit	39.39618682861328
18658/28840	This marriage added Madame de Villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of	24.453889846801758
18659/28840	That assassination was a mysterious affair said Villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one	71.31185913085938
18660/28840	Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a	50.21805953979492
18661/28840	Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered	51.8813362121582
18662/28840	Yes I understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound	61.289772033691406
18663/28840	Villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his	28.734594345092773
18664/28840	He then motioned to his wife to take	28.793712615966797
18665/28840	Now sir said Madame de Villefort I must bid you	21.31077766418457
18666/28840	If he wanted Valentine he closed his right eye only and if Barrois the	188.97132873535156
18667/28840	At Madame de Villeforts proposition he instantly winked his	27.4475040435791
18668/28840	Provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said Then shall I send Valentine to you The old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his	77.13394165039062
18669/28840	and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the	26.558631896972656
18670/28840	Valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted	45.76999282836914
18671/28840	One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to	40.33604049682617
18672/28840	Dear grandpapa cried she what has happened They have vexed you and you are angry   The paralytic closed his eyes in token of ass	19.949644088745117
18673/28840	Who has displeased you Is it my father  	14.071742057800293
18674/28840	Are you displeased with me cried Valentine in aston	55.936580657958984
18675/28840	And what have I done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried	21.383949279785156
18676/28840	There was no answer and she continued   I have not seen you all	46.77019119262695
18677/28840	Has anyone been speaking to you against me   Yes said the old mans look with eager	45.254154205322266
18678/28840	and Madame de Villefort have just left this room have they not  	18.383819580078125
18679/28840	And it was they who told you something which made you angry What was it then May I go and ask them that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you   No no said Noirtiers	36.06847381591797
18680/28840	What can they have said and she again tried to think what it could	108.000732421875
18681/28840	Ah I know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old	48.87792205810547
18682/28840	They have been speaking of my marriagehave they not   Yes replied the angry	39.34359359741211
18683/28840	I understand you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the	43.271942138671875
18684/28840	The reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of	53.10848617553711
18685/28840	They did not even acquaint me with their intentions and I only discovered them by chance that is why I have been so reserved with you dear grandp	44.66738510131836
18686/28840	But there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was It is not only your reserve which afflicts	92.609375
18687/28840	What is it then asked the young	17.657297134399414
18688/28840	Perhaps you think I shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that I shall forget you when I am married  	22.305564880371094
18689/28840	dÉpinay consented to our all living together  	44.97621154785156
18690/28840	Then why are you still vexed and grieved The old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle	35.655086517333984
18691/28840	Yes I understand said Valentine it is because you love	21.348962783813477
18692/28840	And you are afraid I shall be unhappy  	22.878597259521484
18693/28840	Franz The eyes repeated several times No no	420.91900634765625
18694/28840	Then you are vexed with the engagement  	25.807039260864258
18695/28840	Well listen said Valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck I am vexed too for I do not love	39.61225891113281
18696/28840	An expression of intense joy illumined the old mans	34.64527893066406
18697/28840	When I wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me A tear trembled in the eye of the	53.13844299316406
18698/28840	Well continued Valentine the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to	49.434017181396484
18699/28840	Alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in	36.465938568115234
18700/28840	However this is much and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and	171.02650451660156
18701/28840	At these words there appeared in Noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there You are mistaken I can still do much for	36.21866226196289
18702/28840	Do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said	17.30030632019043
18703/28840	Noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and Valentine when he wanted	43.99094009399414
18704/28840	She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to	113.71432495117188
18705/28840	When she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he	64.57477569580078
18706/28840	Ah said Valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter N it is with N that we have to do	117.55583953857422
18707/28840	Well let me see what can you want that begins with N NaNeNiNo   Yes yes yes said the old mans	20.669952392578125
18708/28840	Ah it is No then  	59.39363479614258
18709/28840	Valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before Noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the	35.91182327270508
18710/28840	At the word _Notary_ Noirtier made a sign to her to	22.894044876098633
18711/28840	30169m       Notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa The old man again signified that it was a notary he	17.378026962280273
18712/28840	You would wish a notary to be sent for then said	76.8401107788086
18713/28840	Shall my father be informed of your wish  	53.73444747924805
18714/28840	Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately  	29.764339447021484
18715/28840	Then they shall go for him directly dear grandp	71.50182342529297
18716/28840	Is that all you want  	30.336456298828125
18717/28840	Valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to	18.224580764770508
18718/28840	I am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover	20.83373260498047
18719/28840	And the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a	17.53805160522461
18720/28840	What do you want me for sir demanded he of the paraly	59.772525787353516
18721/28840	Sir said Valentine my grandfather wishes for a not	26.568492889404297
18722/28840	At this strange and unexpected demand	633.7632446289062
18723/28840	de Villefort and his father exchanged	20.057628631591797
18724/28840	Yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the	47.00825500488281
18725/28840	Do you wish for a notary asked Ville	18.171520233154297
18726/28840	What to do   Noirtier made no	17.23602294921875
18727/28840	What do you want with a notary again repeated Ville	19.064510345458984
18728/28840	The invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalter	129.5014190673828
18729/28840	Is it to do us some ill turn Do you think it is worth while said Ville	54.026145935058594
18730/28840	Still said Barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if	55.461647033691406
18731/28840	Noirtier asks for a notary I suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore I shall go at once and fetch	49.94501495361328
18732/28840	Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be	61.09046173095703
18733/28840	30171m       Yes I do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and I should like to see the person who dares to refuse my	24.270315170288086
18734/28840	You shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said Villefort but I shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous	46.39968490600586
18735/28840	Never mind that said Barrois I shall go and fetch a notary	33.890384674072266
18736/28840	And the old servant departed triumphantly on his	83.3963851928711
18737/28840	The Will   As soon as Barrois had left the room Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many	20.683656692504883
18738/28840	The young girl perfectly understood the look and so did Villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows	35.51631164550781
18739/28840	He took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the not	36.66353988647461
18740/28840	Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at Valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the	29.167768478393555
18741/28840	Threequarters of an hour after Barrois returned bringing the notary with	38.5391845703125
18742/28840	Sir said Villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by	27.612842559814453
18743/28840	All his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his	114.3524169921875
18744/28840	Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered	55.35110855102539
18745/28840	Sir said she I perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all	56.557472229003906
18746/28840	That is quite true said Barrois and that is what I told the gentleman as we walked	47.72333908081055
18747/28840	Permit me said the notary turning first to Villefort and then to Valentinepermit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous	59.01471710205078
18748/28840	The first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the	40.38227462768555
18749/28840	An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procure	31.514524459838867
18750/28840	Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the not	19.78986358642578
18751/28840	Sir said she the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and I can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as I can	42.587646484375
18752/28840	Will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject   In order to render an act valid I must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my	29.546621322631836
18753/28840	Illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely	92.5257339477539
18754/28840	Well sir by the help of two signs with which I will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental	55.54920196533203
18755/28840	Noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means	94.26749420166016
18756/28840	You now know quite enough to enable you to converse with	47.38202667236328
18757/28840	Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary	31.38814926147461
18758/28840	You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the not	56.36459732055664
18759/28840	And you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts  	40.942481994628906
18760/28840	It was you who sent for me  	21.51955223083496
18761/28840	To make your will  	81.49586486816406
18762/28840	And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions The old man winked	32.99624252319336
18763/28840	Well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject   But before the notary could answer Villefort had drawn him	37.59324264526367
18764/28840	Sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as	41.61113357543945
18765/28840	Noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties   It is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his	39.67740249633789
18766/28840	You must see that to be an utter impossibility said Ville	42.10202407836914
18767/28840	Valentine and the old man heard this conversation and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the	27.12767791748047
18768/28840	Sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to	84.85295867919922
18769/28840	I can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the	48.245094299316406
18770/28840	I have now been six years with	57.488983154296875
18771/28840	Noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me	40.83647537231445
18772/28840	Let us try what we can do then said the not	60.769500732421875
18773/28840	You accept this young lady as your interpreter	206.04586791992188
18774/28840	Well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up   Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to	39.87554931640625
18775/28840	At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to	31.47906494140625
18776/28840	It is very evident that it is the letter W which	43.85758590698242
18777/28840	Wait said Valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated WaWeWi The old man stopped her at the last syll	19.04034423828125
18778/28840	Valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the	28.908702850341797
18779/28840	She passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word Will	84.9300765991211
18780/28840	Will said the notary it is very evident that	20.093904495239258
18781/28840	Noirtier is desirous of making his	30.962827682495117
18782/28840	Really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to	43.41360855102539
18783/28840	No no no replied the eye of the paraly	33.55073165893555
18784/28840	What said Villefort do you mean to say that Valentine is not interested in your will  	11.05423355102539
18785/28840	As to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of	52.80511474609375
18786/28840	There are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the	86.51539611816406
18787/28840	As to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the	65.66850280761719
18788/28840	But besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the	51.61981201171875
18789/28840	Are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old	28.413759231567383
18790/28840	30175m       Yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his	31.50262451171875
18791/28840	What is he going to do thought Villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions	62.20867919921875
18792/28840	He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but Barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch	35.82048034667969
18793/28840	The procureur then told his wife to come	82.87718963623047
18794/28840	In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic the second notary had also	23.705896377563477
18795/28840	A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the	48.901119232177734
18796/28840	Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune  	26.102243423461914
18797/28840	I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions  	63.29867172241211
18798/28840	There was a kind of solemnity in this	45.2121467590332
18799/28840	Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious	95.50843811035156
18800/28840	They had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have	44.325904846191406
18801/28840	Your fortune exceeds 300000 francs does it not asked	71.28788757324219
18802/28840	Noirtier made a sign that it	17.512439727783203
18803/28840	Do you possess 400000 francs inquired the not	25.674423217773438
18804/28840	600000700000800000900000   Noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed	54.801544189453125
18805/28840	You are then in possession of 900000 francs asked the not	18.663022994995117
18806/28840	The stock is in your own hands   The look which	88.06570434570312
18807/28840	Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to	41.4759635925293
18808/28840	The old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small c	42.24134063720703
18809/28840	Do you permit us to open this casket asked the not	51.22959899902344
18810/28840	They opened it and found 900000 francs in bank sc	45.471954345703125
18811/28840	The first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his	95.1916275024414
18812/28840	The total amount was found to be as	379.7002258300781
18813/28840	It is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vig	42.21604919433594
18814/28840	Then turning towards the paralytic he said You possess then 900000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40000 livres  	30.159259796142578
18815/28840	To whom do you desire to leave this fortune   Oh said Madame de Villefort there is not much doubt on that	18.258129119873047
18816/28840	The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to	39.189144134521484
18817/28840	Valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was	64.77828216552734
18818/28840	The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of	17.357337951660156
18819/28840	What said the notary do you not intend making Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee  	12.938508987426758
18820/28840	You are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention   No repeated Noirtier	34.566925048828125
18821/28840	Valentine raised her head struck dumb with aston	29.446624755859375
18822/28840	It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an	30.9044246673584
18823/28840	But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed   Oh grandpapa I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which I have always	18.518064498901367
18824/28840	Ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not	42.8018684387207
18825/28840	The old mans declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said   Then doubtless dear	28.89392852783203
18826/28840	Noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson Edward de Villefort   The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to	50.18158721923828
18827/28840	No said the notary then perhaps it is to your son	54.55442810058594
18828/28840	The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the test	38.652957916259766
18829/28840	Villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from	60.45698165893555
18830/28840	What have we all done then dear grandpapa said Valentine you no longer seem to love any of us   The old mans eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fond	22.21936798095703
18831/28840	Well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present	48.262821197509766
18832/28840	You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune besides they say I am already rich in right of my mothertoo rich	41.72831344604492
18833/28840	Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentines	27.180070877075195
18834/28840	Oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impaired said Ville	35.043731689453125
18835/28840	It is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa   Yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on Valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his	38.879695892333984
18836/28840	30179m       You are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not   Yes   Really this is too absurd said Ville	15.876614570617676
18837/28840	Excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of	34.3581428527832
18838/28840	Noirtier is quite evident to me and I can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his	50.74333572387695
18839/28840	You do not wish me to marry	19.41177749633789
18840/28840	I do not wish it said the eye of her	19.560256958007812
18841/28840	And you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes  	41.8337287902832
18842/28840	So that but for this marriage she would have been your heir  	46.34825134277344
18843/28840	The two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the	85.12907409667969
18844/28840	But said Villefort who was the first to break the silence I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in	23.942293167114258
18845/28840	I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters	28.390552520751953
18846/28840	It is my wish that she should marry	71.09717559814453
18847/28840	Sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying	14.963035583496094
18848/28840	Franz The old man gave no	169.05946350097656
18849/28840	You will of course dispose of it in some way or other  	30.066186904907227
18850/28840	In favor of some member of your family  	47.20056915283203
18851/28840	Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the not	108.14425659179688
18852/28840	But said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony  	16.664199829101562
18853/28840	You only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son Noirtier made no	32.968902587890625
18854/28840	Do you still wish to dispose of all  	23.974407196044922
18855/28840	But they will contest the will after your death  	64.66126251220703
18856/28840	My father knows me replied Villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position I cannot plead against the	45.56235122680664
18857/28840	The eye of Noirtier beamed with	110.32048797607422
18858/28840	What do you decide on sir asked the notary of Ville	30.79720687866211
18859/28840	Nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know he never alters his	42.83272933959961
18860/28840	These 900000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and I shall therefore act according to my	30.342266082763672
18861/28840	Having said this Villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he	34.88810729980469
18862/28840	The same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to	161.39898681640625
18863/28840	and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them	15.122110366821289
18864/28840	Madame de Villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the	39.74153518676758
18865/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you	21.97542953491211
18866/28840	de Villefort Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime   Villefort tried to	30.705814361572266
18867/28840	No count he replied I am the only victim in this	56.80842971801758
18868/28840	It is I who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against	55.30707550048828
18869/28840	To what do you refer said Monte Cristo with wellfeigned	12.00903034210205
18870/28840	Have you really met with some great misfortune   Oh no monsieur said Villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which I have sustainednothing worth mentioning I assure	17.047260284423828
18871/28840	True said Monte Cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic	32.48936080932617
18872/28840	30183m       What do you say said the count 900000 francs It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a	14.104144096374512
18873/28840	And who is the cause of all this annoyance   My father as I told	26.77387809753418
18874/28840	Noirtier But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed   Yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner I have	61.455055236816406
18875/28840	I left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two not	42.33885192871094
18876/28840	But to do this he must have spoken   He has done better than thathe has made himself	45.907379150390625
18877/28840	How was such a thing possible   By the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal	47.335289001464844
18878/28840	My dear said Madame de Villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the	25.91115951538086
18879/28840	Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious	22.422521591186523
18880/28840	de Villefort has been telling me demanded Monte Cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune   Incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his	21.310577392578125
18881/28840	and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds water	46.458274841308594
18882/28840	My dear said Villefort in answer to his wife you know I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my	46.06275939941406
18883/28840	Nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained for so many	33.90174102783203
18884/28840	The Baron dÉpinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be	31.945220947265625
18885/28840	Do you think said Madame de Villefort that Valentine is in league with him She has always been opposed to this marriage and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between	35.49803161621094
18886/28840	Madame said Villefort believe me a fortune of 900000 francs is not so easily ren	16.95380973815918
18887/28840	She could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a	113.05789947509766
18888/28840	Never mind replied Villefort I say that this marriage _shall_ be consumm	31.6781063079834
18889/28840	Notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said Madame de Villefort selecting a new point of	99.3477783203125
18890/28840	Monte Cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was	143.85169982910156
18891/28840	30185m       Madame replied Villefort I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral	28.506912231445312
18892/28840	The name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to	68.57743072509766
18893/28840	But under the present circumstances I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the	36.923683166503906
18894/28840	It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such cap	89.67063903808594
18895/28840	I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward	108.29503631591797
18896/28840	Noirtier I will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but I shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his	62.92607498168945
18897/28840	Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz dÉpinay because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because I choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever I	54.4974365234375
18898/28840	What said the count the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this	22.961318969726562
18899/28840	Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry	5.646651744842529
18900/28840	le Baron Franz dÉpinay   Yes sir that is the reason said Villefort shrugging his	8.239594459533691
18901/28840	The apparent reason at least said Madame de Ville	25.574512481689453
18902/28840	The _real_ reason madame I can assure you I know my	36.2862548828125
18903/28840	But I want to know in what way	45.448326110839844
18904/28840	dÉpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person   I believe I know	34.97889709472656
18905/28840	Franz dÉpinay said the count is he not the son of General de Quesnel who was created Baron dÉpinay by Charles	29.198753356933594
18906/28840	Well but he is a charming young man according to my	29.641450881958008
18907/28840	He is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of	34.0433235168457
18908/28840	Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying old men are always so selfish in their affection said Madame de Ville	60.08624267578125
18909/28840	Was not your father a Bonapartist asked Monte Cristo I think I remember that you told me something of that	26.389070510864258
18910/28840	My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else said Villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which Napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing	58.397865295410156
18911/28840	When my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the Bourbons for	44.73392105102539
18912/28840	Well said Monte Cristo it is just as I thought it was politics which brought Noirtier and	26.03159523010254
18913/28840	Am I mistaken then said Monte Crist	59.1203727722168
18914/28840	No sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said Madame de Villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that	40.00456237792969
18915/28840	de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate	67.01646423339844
18916/28840	It was a sublime and charitable thought said Monte Cristo and the whole world should applaud	57.207401275634766
18917/28840	It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz dÉpin	14.83962345123291
18918/28840	Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just	15.316186904907227
18919/28840	But the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of	69.9188232421875
18920/28840	Although said Villefort it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune I do not think that	15.61109733581543
18921/28840	dÉpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary	59.81737518310547
18922/28840	He will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with	63.516483306884766
18923/28840	Besides he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of	30.06110382080078
18924/28840	and Madame de SaintMéran her mothers parents who both love her tender	24.408048629760742
18925/28840	And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as	205.41517639160156
18926/28840	Noirtier said Madame de Villefort besides they are to come to Paris in about a month and Valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with	46.58012008666992
18927/28840	The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded selflove and defeated	124.23725891113281
18928/28840	But it seems to me said Monte Cristo and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say that if	15.300652503967285
18929/28840	Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear	16.798519134521484
18930/28840	True said Madame de Villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjustshamefully unjust Poor Edward is as much	22.269569396972656
18931/28840	Noirtiers grandchild as Valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry	33.391448974609375
18932/28840	Noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than	29.68880271911621
18933/28840	The count listened and said no	170.1239776611328
18934/28840	Count said Villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortun	25.026277542114258
18935/28840	It is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and	24.529062271118164
18936/28840	dÉpinay to whom I had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if I endure the most cruel priv	36.65503692626953
18937/28840	However said Madame de Villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to	34.30819320678711
18938/28840	dÉpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Ville	12.017293930053711
18939/28840	Ah that would be a great pity said Ville	21.294509887695312
18940/28840	Undoubtedly said Villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which I was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain	58.23269271850586
18941/28840	No it will all go well	320.6462707519531
18942/28840	dÉpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is	25.198278427124023
18943/28840	de Villefort said Monte Cristo fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice I would persuade him since I have been told	15.387263298034668
18944/28840	dÉpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of	87.98792266845703
18945/28840	I will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on	51.73686599731445
18946/28840	The procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed	125.66966247558594
18947/28840	Well that is all that I wanted and I will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to Monte Crist	19.082109451293945
18948/28840	Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original	58.20723342895508
18949/28840	Sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and	43.83405303955078
18950/28840	dÉpinay even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a	31.372041702270508
18951/28840	At the conclusion of these words the count rose to	75.67395782470703
18952/28840	Are you going to leave us count said Madame de Ville	14.44585132598877
18953/28840	I am sorry to say I must do so madame I only came to remind you of your promise for	28.48354721069336
18954/28840	Did you fear that we should forget it   You are very good madame but	31.18648910522461
18955/28840	de Villefort has so many important and urgent	49.101749420166016
18956/28840	My husband has given me his word sir said Madame de Villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to	38.16920471191406
18957/28840	And said Villefort is it at your house in the ChampsÉlysées that you receive your visitors   No said Monte Cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritoriousit is in the	15.865349769592285
18958/28840	Where is it then Near Paris is it not   Very near only half a league from the Barriersit is at Auteu	30.13632583618164
18959/28840	At Auteuil said Villefort true Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil since it was to your house that she was	22.506290435791016
18960/28840	And in what part of Auteuil do you reside   Rue de la Font	16.801607131958008
18961/28840	Rue de la Fontaine exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone at what number  	21.48240089416504
18962/28840	Then cried Villefort was it you who bought	90.441650390625
18963/28840	de SaintMérans house   Did it belong to	24.509754180908203
18964/28840	Yes replied Madame de Villefort and would you believe it count   Believe what   You think this house pretty do you not   I think it	33.79836654663086
18965/28840	Well my husband would never live in	97.82451629638672
18966/28840	Indeed returned Monte Cristo that is a prejudice on your part	29.656429290771484
18967/28840	de Villefort for which I am quite at a loss to	57.796661376953125
18968/28840	I do not like Auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear	24.570837020874023
18969/28840	But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said Monte Crist	15.461518287658691
18970/28840	No countI hopeI assure you I shall do my best stammered Ville	40.238651275634766
18971/28840	Oh said Monte Cristo I allow of no	48.825523376464844
18972/28840	I shall be expecting you and if you fail to come I shall thinkfor how do I know to the contrarythat this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with	45.13390350341797
18973/28840	I will come countI will be sure to come said Villefort	28.264400482177734
18974/28840	Thank you said Monte Cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of	20.36003875732422
18975/28840	You said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said Madame de Villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other	25.873748779296875
18976/28840	Indeed madame said Monte Cristo I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am	15.185752868652344
18977/28840	Well then it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for hours	117.60147857666016
18978/28840	What is it   A te	17.630924224853516
18979/28840	So now I have told my	103.7531509399414
18980/28840	I began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own	57.174625396728516
18981/28840	Now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrig	70.04369354248047
18982/28840	At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insectactors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of	102.80524444580078
18983/28840	30191m       And are you going there   I	6.871288299560547
18984/28840	_Ma foi_ I should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I had formed of my fellowcreat	34.23311996459961
18985/28840	I shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where I shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to	54.76575469970703
18986/28840	You are a singular man said Ville	22.46125602722168
18987/28840	What line would you advise me to study   The one that is most in use just at this	81.46563720703125
18988/28840	The Spanish one you mean I suppose   Yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you   No said Monte Cristo since as I told you before I do not wish to comprehend	31.708850860595703
18989/28840	The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from	52.56312942504883

18999/28840	At the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white	36.754981994628906
19000/28840	Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and	94.533203125
19001/28840	The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of Delacroix our modern Rub	65.5317153930664
19002/28840	This path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only	104.84354400634766
19003/28840	Never had Flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little	107.67513275146484
19004/28840	In fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the _parterre_ not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp	47.23855209350586
19005/28840	Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look	47.555931091308594
19006/28840	The man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to	74.98934936523438
19007/28840	Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape	45.5287971496582
19008/28840	He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his	195.47520446777344
19009/28840	You are gathering your crop sir said Monte Cristo	44.332950592041016
19010/28840	30193m       Excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap I am not up there I know but I have only just come	17.570919036865234
19011/28840	Do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any	89.48716735839844
19012/28840	I have ten left said the man for here are eleven and I had twentyone five more than last	80.55359649658203
19013/28840	But I am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat	258.8828125
19014/28840	This is the reason that instead of the sixteen I had last year I have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen	101.060546875
19015/28840	Ah I miss three they were here last night sirI am sure they were hereI counted	151.96022033691406
19016/28840	It must be the son of Mère Simon who has stolen them I saw him strolling about here this	68.62960815429688

19018/28840	Certainly it is wrong said Monte Cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the	62.701168060302734
19019/28840	Of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less	75.46927642822266
19020/28840	But sir once more I beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that I am detaining	64.60252380371094
19021/28840	And he glanced timidly at the counts blue	61.663002014160156
19022/28840	Ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy	48.591312408447266

19032/28840	Did you come here sir to see the telegraph he	51.491390228271484
19033/28840	Yes if it isnt contrary to the	82.27098083496094
19034/28840	Oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are	45.53242492675781
19035/28840	I have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you	53.00537872314453
19036/28840	That is true sir and that is what I like best said the man	57.199249267578125
19037/28840	Why do you like that best   Because then I have no	43.669490814208984

19040/28840	Sir said the gardener glancing at the sundial the ten minutes are almost up I must return to my	45.289127349853516
19041/28840	Will you go up with me   I follow	23.995994567871094

19044/28840	Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked Monte Crist	99.06148529052734
19045/28840	The study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so	61.243412017822266
19046/28840	And what is the pay   A thousand francs	32.742103576660156
19047/28840	No but then we are lodged as you	97.99945068359375

19059/28840	I was saying it was very	50.50248718261719
19060/28840	What was   All you were showing	136.52967834472656
19061/28840	And you really understand none of these signals   None at	50.66655731201172
19062/28840	And have you never tried to understand them  	42.079864501953125
19063/28840	Why should I   But still there are some signals only addressed to	60.41291809082031
19064/28840	And do you understand them   They are always the	19.304487228393555
19065/28840	And they mean   _Nothing new You have an hour_ or _Tomorrow	51.93565368652344
19066/28840	This is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion   Ah yes thank you	51.674842834472656
19067/28840	And what is it sayinganything you understand   Yes it asks if I am	30.420886993408203

19069/28840	It is very ingenious said the	29.579204559326172

19072/28840	My dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question   What is it sir   You are fond of gardening   Passion	14.752020835876465
19073/28840	And you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres   Sir I should make a terrestrial paradise of	47.33299255371094
19074/28840	You live badly on your thousand francs   Badly enough but yet I do	115.38951110839844
19075/28840	Yes but you have a wretchedly small	88.32703399658203

19077/28840	Tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand correspondent was telegraphing   I should not see	24.09976577758789
19078/28840	Then what would happen   I could not repeat the	43.539432525634766

19085/28840	Three hundred francs   A hundred crowns yes sir so you see that I am not likely to do any of these	20.689014434814453
19086/28840	Not even for fifteen years wages Come it is worth thinking about   For fifteen thousand francs  	39.489654541015625

19113/28840	Five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister Debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to Danglars	40.990440368652344
19114/28840	Has your husband any Spanish bonds he asked of the baron	57.132354736328125

19123/28840	The same evening the following was read in _Le Messager_   By te	40.76882553100586
19124/28840	The king Don Carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at Bourges and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian	31.364667892456055
19125/28840	All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stockjobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a	30.23464584350586
19126/28840	Those who had kept their shares or bought those of Danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad	63.4273796081543
19127/28840	Next morning _Le Moniteur_ contained the following   It was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of	63.8992805480957

19133/28840	Indeed almost before the door opened the scene	240.888916015625
19134/28840	Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was	83.13536834716797
19135/28840	It is told that the Duc dAntin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed Louis	63.501766204833984
19136/28840	For the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving	42.87268829345703
19137/28840	Thus the house had become unrecognizable and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of	26.323530197143555

19139/28840	Bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantlepieces with	70.35674285888672
19140/28840	One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertucc	100.75798797607422
19141/28840	Before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and Bertuccio with	59.96793746948242
19142/28840	At five oclock precisely the count arrived before the house at Auteuil followed by	17.971269607543945
19143/28840	Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frown	47.555763244628906

19159/28840	Then they follow you asked Monte Crist	98.73684692382812
19160/28840	And at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before	70.3753662109375
19161/28840	The carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horse	30.64095687866211
19162/28840	The instant Debray had touched the ground he was at the carriaged	38.358238220214844
19163/28840	He offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Crist	29.79588508605957
19164/28840	But nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the ministers	33.10470199584961
19165/28840	After his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his	64.18866729736328

19171/28840	You see my position madame said Morrel bestowing a grateful smile on Monte Crist	53.761695861816406
19172/28840	It seems to me said Danglars in his coarse tone illconcealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses	23.407752990722656
19173/28840	Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said	45.17843246459961

19176/28840	How soat what period can that have been   I do not know I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively	88.1342544555664

19256/28840	Debray in pacifying a kingdom you	77.61908721923828
19257/28840	de ChâteauRenaud in pleasing a woman and you Morrel in breaking a horse that no one can	49.57098388671875
19258/28840	For example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond	213.47845458984375
19259/28840	Petersburg the other five leagues from	3622.93505859375
19260/28840	Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table   What are the two fish asked Dangl	50.85601806640625
19261/28840	ChâteauRenaud who has lived in Russia will tell you the name of one and Major Cavalcanti who is an Italian will tell you the name of the	19.378219604492188
19262/28840	This one is I think a sterlet said ChâteauRen	16.803085327148438
19263/28840	And that one if I mistake not a lamp	87.14901733398438
19264/28840	Danglars ask these gentlemen where they are	38.87907409667969
19265/28840	Sterlets said ChâteauRenaud are only found in the Vol	44.13332748413086
19266/28840	And said Cavalcanti I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that	32.05679702758789
19267/28840	Exactly one comes from the Volga and the other from Lake Fus	18.26850128173828
19268/28840	Well this is just what amuses me said Monte Crist	24.981584548950195
19269/28840	I am like Nero_cupitor impossibilium_ and that is what is amusing you at this	45.35166549682617
19270/28840	This fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it	65.02313995361328
19271/28840	But how could you have these fish brought to France   Oh nothing more	44.573909759521484
19272/28840	Danglars   I cannot help doubting answered Danglars with his stupid	8.822690963745117
19273/28840	Baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet	113.54402160644531
19274/28840	Danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their	34.55016326904297
19275/28840	Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the	63.17922592163086
19276/28840	But why have two of each sort asked Dangl	66.84158325195312
19277/28840	Merely because one might have died carelessly answered Monte Crist	89.146240234375
19278/28840	You are certainly an extraordinary man said Danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be	23.850744247436523
19279/28840	And to have ideas added Madame Dangl	30.885568618774414
19280/28840	It was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the	73.97280883789062
19281/28840	Their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when	148.76608276367188
19282/28840	Yes said Debray but then Ostia is only a few leagues from	33.403987884521484
19283/28840	True said Monte Cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after Lucullus if we can do no better than he could   The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say	32.606117248535156
19284/28840	All this is very extraordinary said ChâteauRenaud still what I admire the most I confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are	30.301794052124023
19285/28840	Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago   Certainly not	63.00996398925781
19286/28840	Well I am sure it is quite transformed since last	75.04829406738281
19287/28840	If I remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years	69.34107971191406
19288/28840	Why not I am fond of grass and shade said Monte Crist	80.78307342529297
19289/28840	Yes said Madame de Villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road I	38.09174728393555
19290/28840	Yes madame said Monte Cristo but I preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my	22.40459442138672
19291/28840	In four days said Morrel it is extraordinary   Indeed said ChâteauRenaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull	29.997156143188477
19292/28840	I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when	64.29097747802734
19293/28840	de SaintMéran advertised it for sale two or three years	26.62857437133789
19294/28840	de SaintMéran said Madame de Villefort then this house belonged to	17.072933197021484
19295/28840	de SaintMéran before you bought it   It appears so replied Monte Crist	18.299306869506836
19296/28840	Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it   Quite so my steward transacts all this business for	31.626632690429688
19297/28840	It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said ChâteauRenaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the	37.042938232421875
19298/28840	Really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been	35.69847869873047
19299/28840	Villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it	52.39104461669922
19300/28840	Perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the not	45.83654022216797
19301/28840	It is probable stammered out Villefort trying to smile but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such	21.590471267700195
19302/28840	This house is part of Valentines marriageportion and	64.7337875366211
19303/28840	de SaintMéran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to	33.516937255859375
19304/28840	It was Morrels turn to become	63.3380126953125
19305/28840	There was above all one room continued Monte Cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which I know not why appeared to me quite	75.19129180908203
19306/28840	Why so said Danglars why dramatic   Can we account for instinct said Monte Crist	24.174802780151367
19307/28840	Are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we cannot	125.0770492553711
19308/28840	It is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to other placeswhich very likely have no connection with the present time and	68.030517578125
19309/28840	And there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdem	21.048131942749023
19310/28840	Stay since we have finished dinner I will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the	28.217912673950195
19311/28840	Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his	42.06047821044922
19312/28840	Madame de Villefort rose Monte Cristo did the same and the rest followed their	43.796791076660156
19313/28840	Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid	20.82280731201172
19314/28840	We must go replied Villefort offering his	37.504669189453125
19315/28840	Each one went out by the open	63.42390060424805
19316/28840	Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to	49.43547821044922
19317/28840	They began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of	66.09376525878906
19318/28840	The drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from China of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful	60.03947067260742
19319/28840	At length they arrived at the famous	112.86840057373047
19320/28840	There was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was oldfashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecor	81.21105194091797
19321/28840	These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy	165.2726287841797
19322/28840	cried Madame de Villefort it is really fright	33.99047088623047
19323/28840	Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words but was not	33.374908447265625
19324/28840	Many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the	66.16912841796875
19325/28840	30221m       Is it not so asked Monte Crist	15.057740211486816
19326/28840	Oh said Madame de Villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed   Madame Danglars rose	28.73676109313965
19327/28840	And then said Monte Cristo this is not	12.345794677734375
19328/28840	What is there more said Debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of Madame Dangl	13.325048446655273
19329/28840	Ah what else is there said Danglars for at present I cannot say that I have seen anything	30.7486572265625
19330/28840	Cavalcanti   Ah said he we have at Pisa Ugolinos tower at Ferrara Tassos prison at Rimini the room of Francesca and Pa	61.0766487121582
19331/28840	Yes but you have not this little staircase said Monte Cristo opening a door concealed by the draper	24.626205444335938
19332/28840	Look at it and tell me what you think of	21.677024841308594
19333/28840	What a wickedlooking crooked staircase said ChâteauRenaud with a	18.723663330078125
19334/28840	I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said Debr	47.434913635253906
19335/28840	Ever since Valentines dowry had been mentioned Morrel had been silent and	43.77618408203125
19336/28840	Ah madame cried Debray what is the matter with you how pale you look   It is very evident what is the matter with her said Madame de Villefort	14.211175918579102
19337/28840	de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to	75.6303482055664
19338/28840	Yes said Villefort really count you frighten the	39.958431243896484
19339/28840	What is the matter asked Debray in a whisper of Madame Dangl	8.948053359985352
19340/28840	Nothing she replied with a violent	47.722373962402344
19341/28840	Will you come into the garden said Debray advancing towards the back	23.73691749572754
19342/28840	No no she answered I would rather remain	129.01966857910156
19343/28840	Are you really frightened madame said Monte Crist	23.886903762817383
19344/28840	Oh no sir said Madame Danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of	45.54362106323242
19345/28840	30223m       Ah yes said Monte Cristo smiling it is all a matter of	14.832390785217285
19346/28840	Madame Danglars is ill said Villefort it would be better to take her to her	19.55311393737793
19347/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo taking it from her	10.153904914855957
19348/28840	Yes she said at your advice I have made the	73.8828125
19349/28840	And have you succeeded   I think	20.65045166015625
19350/28840	Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to	34.6015625
19351/28840	Ah she cried what a frightful dream   Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a	25.11117935180664
19352/28840	Danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with Major Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to	22.339542388916016
19353/28840	He took the arm of Madame Danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalc	11.464401245117188
19354/28840	Really madame he said did I alarm you much   Oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our	56.0495719909668
19355/28840	And then you know he said an idea a supposition is	95.18159484863281
19356/28840	Well said Monte Cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this	15.457119941711426
19357/28840	Take care said Madame de Villefort the kings attorney is	21.800039291381836
19358/28840	Ah replied Monte Cristo since that is the case I will take advantage of his presence to make my	20.998119354248047
19359/28840	Oh this is very interesting said Debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate	34.76274871826172
19360/28840	There has been a crime said Monte Crist	24.154800415039062
19361/28840	Villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent	59.200714111328125
19362/28840	He then took Villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of Madame Danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantaintree where the shade was thick	23.957563400268555
19363/28840	30225m       Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen while that of Villefort tremb	10.901459693908691
19364/28840	This house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a	100.45259094238281
19365/28840	Who said it was a crime asked Villefort with a last	38.55708694458008
19366/28840	How is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried Monte Crist	43.41550064086914
19367/28840	And pray what do you call such an action   But who said it was buried alive   Why bury it there if it were dead This garden has never been a	62.79370880126953
19368/28840	What is done to infanticides in this country asked Major Cavalcanti innoc	31.648996353149414
19369/28840	Oh their heads are soon cut off said Dangl	36.85810852050781
19370/28840	I think so am I not right	48.05868911743164
19371/28840	Yes count replied Villefort in a voice now scarcely	51.39476776123047
19372/28840	Indeed count said Madame Danglars I am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that I must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a	28.48475456237793
19373/28840	Monte Cristo bowed and went to Madame de Ville	14.216570854187012
19374/28840	I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle he	28.50984764099121
19375/28840	But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars I must speak to	19.878267288208008
19376/28840	Where   In my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest	66.29703521728516
19377/28840	At this moment Madame de Villefort	23.53787612915039
19378/28840	Thanks my dear friend said Madame Danglars trying to smile it is over now and I am much	12.082355499267578
19379/28840	The Beggar   The evening passed on Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris which Madame Danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she	18.658649444580078
19380/28840	de Villefort was the first to give the signal of	25.535755157470703
19381/28840	He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars that she might be under the care of his	24.7470703125
19382/28840	Danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with	12.570320129394531
19383/28840	Cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was	175.92349243164062
19384/28840	Without opposing their arrangements he allowed Morrel ChâteauRenaud and Debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in	45.5057373046875
19385/28840	Danglars more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his	11.534830093383789
19386/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the English fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray	56.70851135253906
19387/28840	Andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings	135.4420166015625
19388/28840	He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his banknotes had immediately converted them into an available	60.64176559448242
19389/28840	One thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of Danglars for Cavalc	51.34251022338867
19390/28840	The latter faithful to the principle of Horace _nil admirari_ had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were	81.19707489013672
19391/28840	Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words   Tomorrow sir I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on	35.243255615234375
19392/28840	And I sir said Danglars shall be most happy to receive	27.044649124145508
19393/28840	Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel des Princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his	16.260360717773438
19394/28840	To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave	43.89518356323242
19395/28840	As for Andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach	59.16831588745117
19396/28840	The groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to Andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the	72.90185546875
19397/28840	At that moment a hand touched his	152.74850463867188
19398/28840	The young man turned round thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were	42.45085525512695
19399/28840	What do you want of me he	31.146276473999023
19400/28840	Pardon me my friend if I disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but I want to speak to	19.884653091430664
19401/28840	You have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome	80.09072875976562
19402/28840	Come said Andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want Speak quickly	93.85301971435547
19403/28840	The man said in a low voice I wishI wish you to spare me the walk back to	40.1663703918457
19404/28840	I am very tired and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you I can scarcely	47.77346420288086
19405/28840	The young man shuddered at this strange	23.259479522705078
19406/28840	Tell me he saidtell me what you want   Well then I want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me	25.931900024414062

19412/28840	Andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though wellpleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a	81.58595275878906
19413/28840	How does that annoy you   It does not on the contrary I think it will answer my	43.094993591308594
19414/28840	So said Andrea you are speculating upon me   What fine words he uses   I warn you Master Caderousse that you are	22.378515243530273

19431/28840	Oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said Andrea becoming more and more	51.032779693603516

19455/28840	It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about	59.77802658081055
19456/28840	Since you interest yourself in my affairs I think it is now my turn to ask you some	50.64859390258789
19457/28840	Well I shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a	88.88304138183594
19458/28840	Then in the evening I shall go to the theatre I shall look like some retired	30.895782470703125
19459/28840	Come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be	107.41021728515625
19460/28840	Bossuet And youwhat will you become A peer of France   Ah said Andrea who knows   Major Cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is	66.01335144042969
19461/28840	And now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and	44.22248077392578
19462/28840	Then to justify myself I should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the	43.362823486328125

19464/28840	Certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful	32.759071350097656
19465/28840	He drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a	40.247901916503906
19466/28840	But meanwhile Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long Spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of	49.815311431884766
19467/28840	The two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one	129.05621337890625
19468/28840	Andreas hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some	72.48402404785156
19469/28840	Good Caderousse he said how happy you will	30.30239486694336
19470/28840	I will do my best said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard shutting up his	34.06089401245117
19471/28840	Well then we will go into	36.40729522705078
19472/28840	But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on	53.76389694213867
19473/28840	But tell me said Andrea am I to remain bareheaded   Pooh said Caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown	44.72532653808594
19474/28840	Come come enough of this said Cavalc	155.19834899902344
19475/28840	What are you waiting for said Cader	23.59029769897461
19476/28840	I hope I am not the	39.46950149536133
19477/28840	At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse and Caderousse leaped	53.42584228515625

19482/28840	When he reached the wicket of the Louvre he turned to the left galloped across the Carrousel passed through the Rue SaintRoch and issuing from the Rue de la Michodière he arrived at	22.227092742919922
19483/28840	Danglars door just at the same time that Villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg SaintHonoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own	13.590554237365723
19484/28840	No Hermine replied Debray you cannot make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the	23.75483512878418
19485/28840	Danglars was disagreeable certainly but I know how much you care for his illhum	24.467483520507812
19486/28840	Someone has vexed you I will allow no one to annoy	83.24671936035156
19487/28840	You are deceived Lucien I assure you replied Madame Danglars and what I have told you is really the case added to the illhumor you remarked but which I did not think it worth while to allude	27.167949676513672
19488/28840	It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as Debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to	37.366790771484375
19489/28840	At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Cornélie her confidential	19.886066436767578
19490/28840	What is my daughter doing asked Madame Dangl	20.38549041748047
19491/28840	She practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied Mademoiselle Corné	40.02643585205078
19492/28840	Yet I think I hear her	137.23277282714844
19493/28840	It is Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who is playing while Mademoiselle Danglars is in	7.3010454177856445
19494/28840	Well said Madame Danglars come and undress	14.654751777648926
19495/28840	Debray stretched himself upon a large couch and Madame Danglars passed into her dressingroom with Mademoiselle Corné	13.397281646728516
19496/28840	Lucien said Madame Danglars through the door you are always complaining that Eugénie will not address a word to	23.712221145629883
19497/28840	True said Madame Danglars yet I think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your	44.099952697753906
19498/28840	My study   At least that of the	30.5915470123291
19499/28840	Why so   To ask for an engagement at the	36.12187194824219
19500/28840	Really I never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of	70.93699645996094
19501/28840	Well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as	44.0360107421875
19502/28840	Go Cornélie said Madame Danglars I do not require you any	21.228803634643555
19503/28840	Cornélie obeyed and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to Debr	25.735918045043945
19504/28840	Then she began thoughtfully to caress the little sp	143.86007690429688
19505/28840	Lucien looked at her for a moment in	42.78105545043945
19506/28840	Come Hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it not so   30239m       Nothing answered the baron	20.893089294433594
19507/28840	And yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking	55.81117248535156
19508/28840	Debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened	48.64092254638672
19509/28840	At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to	17.376720428466797
19510/28840	Goodevening madame said the banker goodevening	65.63381958007812
19511/28840	Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the	41.89913558959961
19512/28840	Assuming a dignified air she turned round to Debray without answering her	37.76027297973633
19513/28840	Debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with	23.039363861083984
19514/28840	Excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and	105.80948638916016
19515/28840	Debray was petrified not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to	64.0858383178711
19516/28840	The baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock	36.385311126708984
19517/28840	The result was that the proud look entirely failed of its	229.14158630371094
19518/28840	Lucien said the baroness I assure you I have no desire to sleep and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing	28.31243896484375
19519/28840	I am at your service madame replied Lucien cold	9.459901809692383
19520/28840	Do not think I wish to turn you out my dear Debray continued Danglars oh no not at	36.25766372680664
19521/28840	An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely I make such a request I am sure you cannot grudge it to	60.9570426940918
19522/28840	Debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like Nathan in _Athalie	60.76405334472656
19523/28840	It is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over	102.67958068847656
19524/28840	The animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motion	42.03398513793945
19525/28840	Do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving Generally you are only rude but tonight you are	24.09943962097168
19526/28840	It is because I am in a worse humor than usual replied Dangl	28.064577102661133
19527/28840	Hermine looked at the banker with supreme	274.166259765625
19528/28840	These glances frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars but this evening he took no notice of	26.515287399291992
19529/28840	Not so replied Danglars your advice is wrong so I shall not follow	43.777381896972656
19530/28840	My money boxes are my Pactolus as I think	99.6466293334961
19531/28840	Demoustier says and I will not retard its course or disturb its	360.27203369140625
19532/28840	And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune Explain yourself more clearly I beg	84.74423217773438
19533/28840	Oh make yourself easyI am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what I	49.79343795776367
19534/28840	The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700000 francs in the course of an	30.996273040771484
19535/28840	I do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her	15.71412181854248
19536/28840	You understand me perfectly on the contrary said Danglars but if you will persist I will tell you that I have just lost 700000 francs upon the Spanish	16.938310623168945
19537/28840	And pray asked the baroness am I responsible for this loss   Why not   Is it my fault you have lost 700000 francs   Certainly it is not	17.1865177154541
19538/28840	Once for all sir replied the baroness sharply I tell you I will not hear cash named it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first	44.77364730834961
19539/28840	Oh I can well believe that for neither of them was worth a	71.25084686279297
19540/28840	The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and recounted is odious to	83.39411926269531
19541/28840	I only know one thing I dislike more which is the sound of your	65.42340850830078
19542/28840	Well this surprises me for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs   30243m       I What could put such an idea into your head  	30.438217163085938
19543/28840	I should like to know upon what occasion   Oh _mon Dieu_ that is very easily	20.157352447509766
19544/28840	Last February you were the first who told me of the Haitian	59.52944564819336
19545/28840	You had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be	102.90328216552734
19546/28840	I know how clearsighted your dreams are I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt and I gained 400000 francs by it of which 100000 have been honestly paid to	52.975250244140625
19547/28840	You spent it as you pleased that was your	209.67529296875
19548/28840	In March there was a question about a grant to a	114.19390869140625
19549/28840	Three companies presented themselves each offering equal	1244.25439453125
19550/28840	I bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and I picked up a million from which 250000 francs were paid to you for pin	37.454566955566406
19551/28840	How have you spent this 250000 francsit is no business of	56.321044921875
19552/28840	When are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impat	27.97197151184082

19558/28840	They were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and I asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500000 liv	52.56978225708008
19559/28840	Well sir and what then   Ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled	77.01868438720703
19560/28840	Really your manner of speaking   It expresses my meaning and that is all I	59.18730545043945
19561/28840	Well three days after that you talked politics with	154.0688018798828
19562/28840	Debray and you fancied from his words that Don Carlos had returned to	50.53778076171875
19563/28840	Well I sold my shares the news got out and I no longer soldI gave them away next day I find the news was false and by this false report I have lost 700000 franc	70.96170043945312
19564/28840	Well   Well since I gave you a fourth of my gains I think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700000 francs is 175000 franc	27.10112190246582
19565/28840	What you say is absurd and I cannot see why	80.24803924560547
19566/28840	Debrays name is mixed up in this	35.07228469848633
19567/28840	Because if you do not possess the 175000 francs I reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and	26.47930908203125

19570/28840	I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been	50.65668487548828
19571/28840	This cost me on your account and mine 100000 franc	27.707462310791016
19572/28840	I said nothing for we must have peace in the house and 100000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too	65.31446838378906
19573/28840	Well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministers	90.40168762207031
19574/28840	You understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash	83.07518005371094
19575/28840	But today I find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700000 francs per	36.644561767578125
19576/28840	Stop there madame for this cannot	243.48985290527344

19578/28840	But continued Danglars I find you did not even pause there   Insults   You are right let us leave these facts alone and reason co	44.233795166015625
19579/28840	I have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same	29.30235481262207
19580/28840	You say you have nothing to do with my cash	35.435874938964844
19581/28840	Do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty	86.8709487915039
19582/28840	Besides how do I know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy I excite has not concerted with	66.65087127685547
19583/28840	Debray to ruin me   A probable thing   Why not Who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two teleg	42.31710433959961
19584/28840	It was done on purpose for meI am sure of	43.36668395996094
19585/28840	Yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministers secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700000 franc	42.21611785888672
19586/28840	But sir said Hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by	71.3883056640625
19587/28840	Debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it Why to accuse the man do you address the woman   Do I know	42.694637298583984
19588/28840	Debraydo I wish to know himdo I wish to know that he gives advicedo I wish to follow itdo I speculate No you do all this not	54.71162033081055
19589/28840	Still it seems to me that as you profit by it   Danglars shrugged his	11.333540916442871
19590/28840	But it has not been so with meI see and always have seen during the last sixteen	49.49595642089844
19591/28840	You may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived	76.4310531616211
19592/28840	What has been the resultthat thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from	79.15100860595703

19598/28840	Why did he kill himself instead of you Because he had no cash to	121.18888854980469
19599/28840	Debray has made me lose 700000 francs let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the 250000 livres and do as all bankrupts dodisapp	43.594852447509766
19600/28840	He is a charming fellow I allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than	58.92948532104492
19601/28840	Danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to	20.084918975830078
19602/28840	He shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when Madame Danglars recovered from her halffainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable	24.904081344604492

19604/28840	At this time that is about halfpast twelve Madame Danglars ordered her carriage and went	22.957969665527344
19605/28840	Danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting	30.785114288330078
19606/28840	He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared but at two oclock she had not	17.675155639648438
19607/28840	He then called for his horses drove to the Chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the	81.69270324707031
19608/28840	On leaving the Chamber Danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry reentered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the Avenue des ChampsÉlysées	26.692136764526367
19609/28840	Monte Cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing	31.598012924194336
19610/28840	While the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and	36.86468505859375
19611/28840	A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and Monte Cristo	32.21324920654297
19612/28840	Nay said Danglars it is my fault I have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will	35.815032958984375
19613/28840	Not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you You look careworn really you alarm	52.190486907958984

19615/28840	I have been in illluck for several days said Danglars and I have heard nothing but bad	20.255443572998047
19616/28840	Have you had another fall at the Bourse   No I am safe for a few days at	43.09682083129883
19617/28840	I am only annoyed about a bankrupt of Tri	69.4806900024414
19618/28840	Really Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi   Exactly	20.300905227661133
19619/28840	Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I dont know how long to the amount of 800000 or 900000 francs during the	22.40642738342285
19620/28840	Never a mistake or delaya fellow who paid like a	203.16293334960938
19621/28840	Well I was a million in advance with him and now my fine Jacopo Manfredi suspends payment   Really   It is an unheardof fat	24.64219856262207
19622/28840	I draw upon him for 600000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that I hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400000 francs payable at his correspondents in Paris at the end of this	34.70701217651367
19623/28840	I present them but my correspondent has	137.47988891601562
19624/28840	This with my Spanish affairs made a pretty end to the	145.0418243408203
19625/28840	Then you really lost by that affair in Spain   Yes only 700000 francs out of my cash boxnothing more   Why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager   Oh it is all my wifes	33.261505126953125
19626/28840	She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to Spain she believes in	300.4521179199219
19627/28840	It is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures	78.63407897949219
19628/28840	On this conviction I allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and	222.1038055419922
19629/28840	It is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700000 francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it	60.18126678466797
19630/28840	But do you mean to say you have not heard of this Why the thing has made a tremendous	30.92438507080078
19631/28840	Yes I heard it spoken of but I did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the B	34.740211486816406
19632/28840	30251m       Then you do not speculate   IHow could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in regulating my income I should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a	41.57698059082031
19633/28840	But touching these Spanish affairs I think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos	61.33137512207031
19634/28840	Well thats what puzzles me replied Danglars the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by te	33.389442443847656
19635/28840	So that said Monte Cristo you have lost nearly 1700000 francs this	16.799652099609375
19636/28840	Not nearly indeed that is exactly my	450.24237060546875
19637/28840	_Diable_ said Monte Cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate	32.1297721862793
19638/28840	Thirdrate said Danglars rather humble what do you mean by that   Certainly continued Monte Cristo I make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate	26.589448928833008
19639/28840	I think this is about your position is it not   Confound it yes replied Dangl	16.177448272705078
19640/28840	The result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to	159.66139221191406
19641/28840	Oh said Danglars becoming very pale how you are running on   Let us imagine seven such months continued Monte Cristo in the same	27.169950485229492
19642/28840	Do you want money Do you wish me to lend you some   30253m       What a bad calculator you are exclaimed Danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissim	15.30936336517334
19643/28840	I have made money at the same time by speculations which have	39.113277435302734
19644/28840	I have made up the loss of blood by	52.68902587890625

19646/28840	Very good very good But the wound remains and will reopen at the first	307.2687072753906
19647/28840	No for I am only embarked in certainties replied Danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to	32.52328109741211

19650/28840	Danglars said Monte Cristo I see I was deceived and that you belong to the class of secondrate	15.521055221557617
19651/28840	I think I may aspire to that honor said Danglars with a smile which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of	31.279714584350586
19652/28840	But while we are speaking of business Danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what I am to do for	37.33748245239258
19653/28840	Give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems	86.5881576538086
19654/28840	Excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40000 francs payable at sight on you signed by Busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsementof course I immediately counted him over the forty bank	72.6086654663086
19655/28840	Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of ass	31.303834915161133
19656/28840	But that is not all continued Danglars he has opened an account with my house for his	36.19622802734375
19657/28840	May I ask how much he allows the young man   Five thousand francs per	21.549442291259766
19658/28840	I thought I was right in believing that Cavalcanti to be a stingy	42.671966552734375
19659/28840	How can a young man live upon 5000 francs a month   But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more   Do not advance it the father will never repay	41.432498931884766
19660/28840	You do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular mis	54.44546127319336
19661/28840	And by whom were they recommended to you   Oh by the house of Fenzi one of the best in	41.471553802490234
19662/28840	I do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the	64.94656372070312
19663/28840	Would you not trust the Cavalcanti   I oh I would advance ten millions on his	116.75881958007812
19664/28840	I was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just	59.67273712158203
19665/28840	And with all this how unassuming he is I should never have taken him for anything more than a mere	32.93566131591797
19666/28840	And you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no	58.29014587402344

19669/28840	The young man is better said Dangl	14.686651229858398
19670/28840	Yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared toler	211.33621215820312
19671/28840	Why   Because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told	31.326679229736328
19672/28840	He has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to Paris	42.22196960449219
19673/28840	Ah I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked Danglars carelessly they like to unite their	89.89252471923828
19674/28840	It is usual certainly but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other	61.800315856933594
19675/28840	I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a	27.138492584228516
19676/28840	Do you think so   I am sure of	7.868167877197266
19677/28840	And you have heard his fortune mentioned   Nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a far	70.72209930419922
19678/28840	And what is your opinion   I ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal	30.944238662719727
19679/28840	Certainly said Danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of	36.63892364501953
19680/28840	Very little at least I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in Lu	91.05381774902344
19681/28840	Ah he has a palace said Danglars laughing come that is	36.93910598754883

19693/28840	Danglars that you are asking so many questions   _Ma foi_ said Danglars it would not be a bad speculation I fancy and you know I am a spec	12.746185302734375
19694/28840	But he is betrothed to your daughter I believe   Well	46.464935302734375
19695/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more	16.69289779663086
19696/28840	Oh I do not mean her fortune only but tell me   What   Why did you not invite	29.725746154785156
19697/28840	and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner   I did so but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea	30.796537399291992
19698/28840	Yes yes said Danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of	19.856414794921875
19699/28840	Why so   Because it is the air she always breathed in her	54.093475341796875

19721/28840	It would be very easy if you much wished it   How so   Probably you have some correspondent in Greece   I should think	30.685237884521484
19722/28840	Well write to your correspondent in Yanina and ask him what part was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali Tepel	36.74858856201172
19723/28840	You are right exclaimed Danglars rising quickly I will write	41.86315155029297

19731/28840	At the Rue Guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Har	29.385910034179688
19732/28840	As soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bon	39.663330078125
19733/28840	She then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocketmirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone	56.732933044433594
19734/28840	The cab crossed the PontNeuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des PasPerd	23.768896102905273
19735/28840	There was a great deal going on that morning and many businesslike persons at the Palais businesslike persons pay very little attention to women and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her	52.00996780395508
19736/28840	There was a great press of people in	106.37359619140625
19737/28840	de Villeforts antechamber but Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her	19.898273468017578
19738/28840	The instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to	54.35621643066406

19752/28840	In any case sir you will allow replied Madame Danglars that even if the fault were alone mine I last night received a severe punishment for	79.96156311035156
19753/28840	Poor thing said Villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet   Well   Well I must tell	31.02997589111328
19754/28840	Collect all your courage for you have not yet heard	32.35593795776367

19794/28840	I understood that I had nothing to fear that I should neither be seen nor heard so I decided upon descending to the	37.741146087646484
19795/28840	I descended the staircase step by step the only thing I could not conquer was a strange trembling in my	132.6977996826172

19797/28840	Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall I took it and advanced towards the thick	36.17186737060547
19798/28840	I had provided myself with a dark	84.94015502929688

19802/28840	I fancied continually that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the	64.7633056640625

19805/28840	I tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the precise spot where I stopped to dig the	78.89480590820312
19806/28840	The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow	93.33550262451172
19807/28840	Still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there I had turned up the	206.87449645996094

19809/28840	How I worked how I hoped how I struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade But no I found nothing though I had made a hole twice as large as the	77.70188903808594
19810/28840	I thought I had been deceivedhad mistaken the	114.31681060791016
19811/28840	I turned around I looked at the trees I tried to recall the details which had struck me at the	45.54004669189453
19812/28840	A cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my	129.99432373046875
19813/28840	On my right I saw the tree behind me the	111.68623352050781
19814/28840	I stood in the same attitude and threw myself	47.24921417236328
19815/28840	I rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still I found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there   30269m       The chest no longer there murmured Madame Danglars choking with	29.820959091186523
19816/28840	Think not I contented myself with this one effort continued Ville	77.05325317382812
19817/28840	I thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but I could find	98.51398468017578
19818/28840	Then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a	42.09043502807617
19819/28840	In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my	79.36707305908203
19820/28840	I remained in the room and	35.13780975341797

19823/28840	I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the	48.1552734375

19826/28840	Supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart I returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for	57.82215881347656
19827/28840	Oh cried Madame Danglars it was enough to drive you mad   I hoped for a moment that it might said Villefort but that happiness was denied	32.620235443115234
19828/28840	However recovering my strength and my ideas Why said I should that man have carried away the corpse   But you said replied Madame Danglars he would require it as a	75.87857818603516

19851/28840	And what do you think I did I feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of	37.25291442871094
19852/28840	They traced her to Châlons and there they lost	130.5624237060547
19853/28840	They lost her   Yes	181.96633911132812
19854/28840	Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every	41.20819854736328
19855/28840	And this is all said she and you stopped there   Oh no said Villefort I never ceased to search and to	32.295169830322266
19856/28840	However the last two or three years I had allowed myself some resp	42.23358917236328
19857/28840	But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my	56.1001091003418
19858/28840	But replied Madame Danglars the Count of Monte Cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he	29.00310707092285
19859/28840	Oh the wickedness of man is very great said Villefort since it surpasses the goodness of	46.322906494140625
19860/28840	Did you observe that mans eyes while he was speaking to us  	46.52092361450195
19861/28840	But have you ever watched him carefully   Doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck meof all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched	85.9114990234375
19862/28840	I might have suspected he was poisoning	130.73898315429688
19863/28840	And you see you would have been	33.99031448364258
19864/28840	But believe me that man has other	197.42550659179688
19865/28840	For that reason I wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against	72.1105728149414
19866/28840	Tell me cried Villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection   Never to	39.06914520263672
19867/28840	You understand me replied Villefort affectionately when I say anyonepardon my urgencyto anyone living I mean   Yes yes I understand very well ejaculated the baroness never I swear to	41.233367919921875
19868/28840	Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning Do you keep a journal   No my life has been passed in frivolity I wish to forget it	49.31770706176758
19869/28840	Do you talk in your sleep   30275m       I sleep soundly like a child do you not remember   The color mounted to the baronesss face and Villefort turned awfully	15.968274116516113
19870/28840	It is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be	20.254676818847656
19871/28840	Well I understand what I now have to do replied Ville	20.549741744995117
19872/28840	In less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this	194.1624755859375
19873/28840	de Monte Cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a	58.63557052612305
19874/28840	Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard	23.939897537231445
19875/28840	Then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the	34.696598052978516
19876/28840	Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for	29.133081436157227

19878/28840	In a moment the door was opened and Madame de Morcerf alighted leaning on her sons	9.081438064575195
19879/28840	Albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the ChampsÉlysées to the house of Monte Crist	23.48379898071289
19880/28840	The count received him with his habitual	43.084205627441406
19881/28840	It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans	66.88255310058594

19884/28840	Monte Cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable	102.8797836303711
19885/28840	From Dieppe   No from Tré	32.731300354003906
19886/28840	Indeed   And I have come at once to see	20.51272964477539
19887/28840	That is extremely kind of you said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect	22.542070388793945
19888/28840	And what is the news   You should not ask a stranger a foreigner for	60.02452850341797
19889/28840	I know it but in asking for news I mean have you done anything for me   Had you commissioned me said Monte Cristo feigning uneas	28.19962501525879
19890/28840	Come come said Albert do not assume so much	83.43965911865234
19891/28840	It is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at Tréport I felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of	58.37514877319336
19892/28840	Possibly said Monte Cristo I have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted indeed without my	59.05905532836914

19897/28840	Is he not a count   What can I know of him He calls himself	45.21400451660156
19898/28840	I of course give him the same title and everyone else does	88.9486312866211
19899/28840	What a strange man you are What next You say	125.9158935546875
19900/28840	Danglars dined here   Yes with Count Cavalcanti the marquis his father Madame Danglars	21.94567108154297
19901/28840	Did they speak of me   Not a	39.728633880615234
19902/28840	Why so I thought you wished them to forget you   If they did not speak of me I am sure they thought about me and I am in	28.809532165527344
19903/28840	How will that affect you since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you Truly she might have thought of you at	36.785797119140625
19904/28840	I have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which I think of	32.020973205566406
19905/28840	Touching sympathy So you hate each other said the	127.97052764892578
19906/28840	Listen said Morcerfif Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families I am ready to agree to the	24.509584426879883
19907/28840	But as this dream cannot be realized since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens	50.22476577758789
19908/28840	One may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens There she must always be and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be	39.281429290771484
19909/28840	Yes for I often wish for what is	125.7579116821289
19910/28840	What is that   To find such a wife as my father	50.72601318359375
19911/28840	Monte Cristo turned pale and looked at Albert while playing with some magnificent	59.233436584472656
19912/28840	Your father was fortunate then said	300.7542724609375

19914/28840	30279m       That is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single	49.294246673583984
19915/28840	Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Dangl	12.910161018371582
19916/28840	Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has	28.207075119018555
19917/28840	That is what I call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry	129.95880126953125
19918/28840	Apropos continued he Franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him I think   I said Monte Cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that I did not like	44.160675048828125

19920/28840	Did you say he was coming   Yes summoned by	73.17503356933594
19921/28840	de Villefort who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as	31.30216407775879
19922/28840	Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie	6.418861389160156
19923/28840	It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is	88.46553802490234

19926/28840	He entertains a very high opinion of	132.7837677001953
19927/28840	Which they deserve do they not   I believe they	31.29027557373047
19928/28840	de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just	85.75277709960938
19929/28840	There is then one said Monte Cristo whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars   Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied Albert	28.779876708984375
19930/28840	Indeed my dear sir said Monte Cristo you are revoltingly fopp	27.787437438964844

19932/28840	Let things take their course perhaps you may not have to	100.5457992553711
19933/28840	Doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement   I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do	22.781475067138672
19934/28840	Danglars would give double that sum to attain the same	47.07978057861328
19935/28840	Am I indeed so happy said Albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his	48.774227142333984
19936/28840	Danglars any reason   Ah there is your proud and selfish	55.384639739990234

20008/28840	Will he be at home at eight oclock this evening   Doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were	31.67619514465332
20009/28840	I will come again at that time replied the visitor who then	50.626319885253906
20010/28840	At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Férou drove up to the green	31.714740753173828
20011/28840	He knocked and it opened immediately to admit	451.03289794921875
20012/28840	From the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good	86.15325164794922
20013/28840	Is the abbé at home asked	74.76890563964844
20014/28840	Yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the val	36.231300354003906

20019/28840	The abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the	41.25711441040039
20020/28840	I am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked Italian	8.70655632019043
20021/28840	The mission with which I am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is	54.336936950683594
20022/28840	Your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which I am deputed to see	57.26373291015625
20023/28840	It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the	66.14897155761719
20024/28840	Provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my	92.83305358886719
20025/28840	I am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and God and not between me and human	64.26823425292969
20026/28840	Do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your	57.69343185424805
20027/28840	At this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained	77.40618896484375
20028/28840	Excuse me abbé said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very	51.420654296875
20029/28840	I will come at once to the	26.13097381591797
20030/28840	Well be it solet us not dispute about words and since	262.3970947265625
20031/28840	Zaccone are the same   Absolutely the	72.24048614501953
20032/28840	I asked you if you knew him   Extremely	44.13174819946289
20033/28840	Who is he   The son of a rich shipbuilder in	29.016305923461914
20034/28840	I know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague	58.383079528808594
20035/28840	However replied the abbé with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the	33.95001220703125
20036/28840	Are you sure of what you assert   What do you mean by that question   Understand sir I do not in the least suspect your veracity I ask if you are certain of it   I knew his father	26.383432388305664
20037/28840	Ah indeed   And when a child I often played with the son in the timbery	76.00448608398438
20038/28840	But whence does he derive the title of count   You are aware that may be	25.49847984313965
20039/28840	And his immense riches whence does he procure them   They may not be so very	50.947120666503906
20040/28840	How much do you suppose he possesses   From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per ann	18.283464431762695
20041/28840	That is reasonable said the visitor I have heard he had three or four	33.4549674987793
20042/28840	Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of	41.973785400390625
20043/28840	But I was told he had four millions per ann	37.275691986083984
20044/28840	Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo   Certainly everyone who has come from Palermo Naples or Rome to France by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen	39.93696594238281
20045/28840	I am told it is a delightful place   It is a	24.83729362487793
20046/28840	And why has the count bought a rock   For the sake of being a	56.47996139526367
20047/28840	In Italy one must have territorial possessions to be a	117.41617584228516
20048/28840	You have doubtless heard the adventures of	128.66217041015625

20050/28840	I know nothing certain at that period of his life I lost sight of my young	59.323917388916016
20051/28840	Was he in the wars   I think he entered the	71.09683990478516
20052/28840	In what branch   In the	74.35853576660156
20053/28840	Are you not his confessor   No sir I believe he is a	23.280866622924805
20054/28840	A Lutheran   I say I believe such is the case I do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in	60.914039611816406
20055/28840	Doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police I ask you what you know of	34.57781219482422
20056/28840	He passes for a very charitable	174.7869873046875

20059/28840	He is a Quaker then   Exactly he is a Quaker with the exception of the peculiar	24.71280860900879
20060/28840	Has he any friends   Yes everyone who knows him is his	97.92102813720703

20068/28840	Now sir I have but one question more to ask and I charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candid	50.309303283691406
20069/28840	What is it sir   Do you know with what design	30.75273323059082

20071/28840	What is it sir   To make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the Count of Pisani at Paler	28.971609115600586
20072/28840	Do you know about that institution   I have heard of	12.144145011901855
20073/28840	Having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his	69.91279602050781
20074/28840	The visitor either understood the abbés meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the	51.14791488647461
20075/28840	However   My resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevol	47.806663513183594
20076/28840	The abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of	32.2490348815918
20077/28840	An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the Rue FontaineSaintGeorges and stopped at	22.29742431640625
20078/28840	The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o	42.637733459472656
20079/28840	As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that Lord Wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock	43.78152847290039
20080/28840	The visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnished drawing	73.93617248535156
20081/28840	It was illuminated by lamps with groundglass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoys weak	76.62599182128906
20082/28840	After ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore	29.73111915588379

20084/28840	His first remark on entering was   You know sir I do not speak French   I know you do not like to converse in our language replied the	42.34805679321289
20085/28840	But you may use it replied Lord Wilmore I understand	57.293697357177734
20086/28840	And I replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of English to keep up the	121.63873291015625
20087/28840	Do not put yourself to the slightest	125.60245513916016
20088/28840	Aw said Lord Wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of Great	29.052732467651367
20089/28840	The envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with English coolness and having finished   I understand said he	67.35419464111328
20090/28840	30293m       Then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abbé Bus	19.644908905029297
20091/28840	It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to England and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by	59.57215118408203
20092/28840	Then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in Greece broke out and he had served in the Grecian	103.12938690185547
20093/28840	While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from	61.46104049682617
20094/28840	After the battle of Navarino when the Greek government was consolidated he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district which was given	54.58500289916992
20095/28840	Hence that immense fortune which in Lord Wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the	77.46522521972656
20096/28840	But asked the visitor do you know why he came to France   He is speculating in railways said Lord Wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to	33.5997428894043
20097/28840	How much does he spend yearly asked the pre	123.40194702148438
20098/28840	Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said Lord Wilmore he is a	16.38199234008789
20099/28840	Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avar	118.04244995117188
20100/28840	Do you know his house at Auteuil  	11.410950660705566
20101/28840	What do you know respecting it   Do you wish to know why he bought it  	15.37228775024414
20102/28840	The count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in	80.13775634765625
20103/28840	He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnères Luchon and Cautere	97.39566040039062
20104/28840	He is going to turn his house into a _Badhaus_ as the Germans term	27.549497604370117
20105/28840	He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous	67.80973815917969
20106/28840	Now as I dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him I am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take	71.53688049316406
20107/28840	What was the cause of your quarrel   When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my	26.845212936401367
20108/28840	Why do you not seek revenge   I have already fought three duels with him said the Englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sab	36.205204010009766
20109/28840	And what was the result of those duels   The first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large	54.60671615600586
20110/28840	The Englishman turned down his shirtcollar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent	87.5307846069336
20111/28840	So that you see there is a deadly feud between	20.033287048339844
20112/28840	But said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if I understand you	50.03936767578125
20113/28840	Aw said the Englishman I practice shooting every day and every other day Grisier comes to my	59.94375228881836
20114/28840	This was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the Englishman appeared to	58.45756912231445

20121/28840	At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to	62.94255065917969
20122/28840	Until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the	53.47005081176758

20158/28840	Well Im sure said Morcerf this is indeed news Am I allowed to repeat it   Yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say I told	50.74121856689453
20159/28840	Why so   Because it is a secret just	46.215858459472656
20160/28840	Then the news originated   At the prefects last	66.17146301269531
20161/28840	Paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made	54.63669204711914
20162/28840	Well well Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too	66.70994567871094
20163/28840	Indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so	60.09357452392578
20164/28840	Poor count And is he aware of the danger he has been in   I think	53.1410026550293
20165/28840	Then it will be but charitable to inform	41.08460235595703
20166/28840	When he arrives I will not fail to do	29.05291175842285
20167/28840	Just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to Madame de Ville	20.72633171081543
20168/28840	Madame said Albert allow me to present to you	18.8106632232666

20170/28840	I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo replied Madame de Villefort turning away with marked coldness of	12.97157096862793
20171/28840	This answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor Mor	79.16009521484375
20172/28840	But a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her	71.24171447753906
20173/28840	They might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their	148.68692016601562
20174/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo had just	8.103011131286621
20175/28840	We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he	43.38395309448242
20176/28840	Many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more _significant_ if the expression may be	114.65789794921875
20177/28840	Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be	41.349605560302734
20178/28840	Yet the Parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense	67.24771881103516
20179/28840	She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to	27.04593276977539
20180/28840	No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert who received him cord	38.41015625
20181/28840	Have you seen my mother asked	169.9217987060547
20182/28840	I have just had the pleasure replied the count but I have not seen your	16.624977111816406
20183/28840	See he is down there talking politics with that little group of great gen	112.72162628173828
20184/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great	58.54103088378906
20185/28840	And for what kind of talent are they celebrated You know there are different	100.8363265991211
20186/28840	That tall harshlooking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of Rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the	91.99009704589844
20187/28840	The thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his	83.92111206054688
20188/28840	I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor was made an	23.10134506225586
20189/28840	Come said Monte Cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely	17.89864158630371
20190/28840	I suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a	56.165122985839844
20191/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo so this gentleman is an Academician   Within the last week he has been made one of the learned	31.5758056640625
20192/28840	And what is his especial talent   His talent I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whale	58.70665740966797
20193/28840	And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this   No of the French	38.66775131225586
20194/28840	But what has the French Academy to do with all this   I was going to tell	14.2057523727417
20195/28840	It seems   That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless   No that his style of writing is very	188.24932861328125
20196/28840	This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out   Albert	58.302574157714844
20197/28840	And the other one demanded the	60.62238693237305
20198/28840	That one   Yes the	52.49140548706055
20199/28840	The one in the dark blue coat  	51.123565673828125
20200/28840	He is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a	41.86167526245117
20201/28840	He was very successful upon that	209.7563934326172
20202/28840	He stood badly with the Liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the	112.86231994628906
20203/28840	They talk of making him an	275.43023681640625
20204/28840	30303m       And what are his claims to the peerage   He has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the _Siècle_ and voted five or six years on the ministerial	22.625226974487305
20205/28840	Bravo viscount said Monte Cristo smiling you are a delightful _cicerone	24.07117462158203
20206/28840	And now you will do me a favor will you not   What is it   Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn	23.708948135375977
20207/28840	Just then the count felt his arm	87.46978759765625
20208/28840	Ah is it you baron said	45.53368377685547
20209/28840	Why do you call me baron said Danglars you know that I care nothing for my	19.576175689697266
20210/28840	I am not like you viscount you like your title do you not   Certainly replied Albert seeing that without my title I should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the	60.40995407104492
20211/28840	Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July replied Dangl	38.66637420654297
20212/28840	Unfortunately said Monte Cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of France or academician for example the millionaires Franck  Poulmann of Frankfurt who have just become bankrupt	67.90104675292969
20213/28840	Yes I received the news this evening by a	64.91969299316406
20214/28840	I had about a million in their hands but warned in time I withdrew it a month	103.03496551513672
20215/28840	Ah _mon Dieu_ exclaimed Danglars they have drawn on me for 200000 francs   Well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per	24.53032684326172
20216/28840	Yes but it is too late said Danglars I have honored their	21.54619598388672
20217/28840	Then said Monte Cristo here are 200000 francs gone after   Hush do not mention these things said Danglars then approaching Monte Cristo he added especially before young	39.234737396240234
20218/28840	Cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in	93.91004943847656
20219/28840	Albert had left the count to speak to his mother Danglars to converse with young Cavalcanti Monte Cristo was for an instant	24.073665618896484
20220/28840	The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with 	109.76296997070312
20221/28840	Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refresh	28.61269187927246
20222/28840	Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of	31.4787540435791
20223/28840	Albert she asked did you notice that   What mother   That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of	41.560123443603516
20224/28840	Yes but then he breakfasted with meindeed he made his first appearance in the world on that	49.94032669067383
20225/28840	de Morcerfs murmured Mercédès and since he has been here I have watched	15.178773880004883
20226/28840	Well   Well he has taken nothing	46.16027069091797
20227/28840	Approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking	279.4726867675781
20228/28840	But why mother   Just to please me Albert said Mercédè	45.321475982666016
20229/28840	Albert kissed his mothers hand and drew near the	64.58964538574219
20230/28840	Another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately	167.69886779785156
20231/28840	Albert rejoined his mother she was very	66.03736877441406
20232/28840	Well said she you see he refuses   Yes but why need this annoy you   You know Albert women are singular	48.740257263183594
20233/28840	I should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an	85.1663818359375
20234/28840	Perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living and might prefer something	77.70069885253906
20235/28840	Oh no I have seen him eat of everything in Italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this	58.683509826660156
20236/28840	And besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we	89.86106872558594
20237/28840	I do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the	40.46133041381836
20238/28840	In a word said Mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was	26.43959617614746
20239/28840	A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the	41.22602462768555
20240/28840	Dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated	63.94161605834961
20241/28840	At the same time Mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes	17.193330764770508
20242/28840	She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the	78.01786804199219
20243/28840	Do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer I should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not	120.91667175292969
20244/28840	Ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung _Partant pour la Syrie_we will not go alone to the	59.414306640625
20245/28840	Then said Mercédès I will lead the	20.995004653930664
20246/28840	Turning towards Monte Cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm   The count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on Mercédè	18.87985610961914
20247/28840	It was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one	51.955631256103516
20248/28840	He offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camell	37.400230407714844
20249/28840	Behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of	49.44229507446289
20250/28840	Bread and Salt   Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her	86.53899383544922
20251/28840	It led through a grove of lindens to a conserv	72.8963623046875
20252/28840	It was too warm in the room was it not count she	62.82581329345703
20253/28840	Yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blind	25.673189163208008
20254/28840	As he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of Mercédès trem	15.499899864196777
20255/28840	But you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold   Do you know where I am leading you said the countess without replying to the	41.8718147277832
20256/28840	No madame replied Monte Cristo but you see I make no	15.120599746704102
20257/28840	We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the gro	37.189212799072266
20258/28840	The count looked at Mercédès as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from	26.053972244262695
20259/28840	They reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our	55.54146957397461
20260/28840	The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo and gathered a bunch of Muscatel	28.847536087036133
20261/28840	See count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our French grapes are not to be compared I know with yours of Sicily and Cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern	53.0235595703125
20262/28840	Do you refuse said Mercédès in a tremulous	13.673223495483398
20263/28840	Pray excuse me madame replied Monte Cristo but I never eat Muscatel	23.217609405517578
20264/28840	A magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial	97.94572448730469
20265/28840	Mercédès drew near and plucked the	23.818971633911133
20266/28840	What again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain	82.95001220703125
20267/28840	A long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the	312.1764221191406
20268/28840	Count added Mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful Arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same	34.18075942993164
20269/28840	I know it madame replied the count but we are in France and not in Arabia and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one	28.874797821044922
20270/28840	Certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be   The answer was so little like the one Mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a gro	36.80200958251953
20271/28840	They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a	33.761810302734375
20272/28840	Sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply   I have suffered deeply madame answered Monte Crist	42.68806457519531
20273/28840	But now you are happy   Doubtless replied the count since no one hears me	34.61677169799805
20274/28840	And your present happiness has it softened your heart   My present happiness equals my past misery said the	40.14656066894531
20275/28840	Are you not married asked the count	44.88175582885742
20276/28840	I married exclaimed Monte Cristo shuddering who could have told you so   No one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely	35.1726188659668
20277/28840	She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople madame the daughter of a	44.484535217285156
20278/28840	I have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the	57.220882415771484

20280/28840	You have no sisterno sonno father   I have no	90.9048080444336
20281/28840	How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life   It is not my fault mad	34.695892333984375
20282/28840	At Malta I loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me	90.40702819824219
20283/28840	I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my	35.04396438598633
20284/28840	This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of	26.50755500793457
20285/28840	Perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and I suffered more than they would have done in my place that is	37.20906066894531
20286/28840	The countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for	44.57748031616211
20287/28840	Yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again   30309m      	19.908430099487305
20288/28840	Never   I never returned to the country where she	53.1215705871582
20289/28840	She is then now at Malta   I think	45.768890380859375
20290/28840	And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer   Hery	70.26447296142578
20291/28840	But only her do you then still hate those who separated you   I hate them Not at all why should I The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed	47.23891067504883
20292/28840	Madame I never eat Muscatel grapes replied Monte Cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned	20.40224266052246
20293/28840	The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of	77.62948608398438
20294/28840	Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to	44.32682418823242
20295/28840	Oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened   What What has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune Indeed I should expect misfortun	42.287391662597656
20296/28840	Well   He comes to fetch his wife and	18.1800594329834
20297/28840	Why so   Because Madame de SaintMéran is just arrived in Paris bringing the news of	15.93218994140625

20302/28840	Ah indeed   So Franz must	197.2716522216797
20303/28840	And she took two or three steps	36.17251205444336
20304/28840	Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them	34.864376068115234
20305/28840	We are friends are we not she	112.15459442138672

20462/28840	The doctor pressed Valentines hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the	48.482383728027344
20463/28840	We need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite	143.08761596679688
20464/28840	After remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the	43.86883544921875
20465/28840	As usual Valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering	105.71019744873047
20466/28840	The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of w	52.77713394165039
20467/28840	30327m       She then turned towards the	10.518783569335938
20468/28840	As she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her	49.69517517089844
20469/28840	She stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of Maximil	83.1435317993164
20470/28840	The Promise   It was indeed Maximilian Morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous	25.096830368041992
20471/28840	With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of Madame de SaintMéran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at	27.732227325439453
20472/28840	de Villeforts in connection with his attachment for	87.1086654663086
20473/28840	His presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnutt	86.51935577392578
20474/28840	Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through	65.15218353271484
20475/28840	Morrel called her and she ran to the	20.01508331298828

20478/28840	This is indeed a house of mourning said Valentine speak Maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already	106.12691497802734
20479/28840	Dear Valentine said Morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen I entreat you what I am about to say is very	17.602266311645508
20480/28840	When are you to be married   I will tell you all said Valentine from you I have nothing to	23.043533325195312
20481/28840	This morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom I depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of	98.81757354736328
20482/28840	dÉpinay and the following day the contract will be	23.511005401611328
20483/28840	A deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he	89.95465850830078
20484/28840	Alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own	88.59425354003906
20485/28840	The sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and I will not endeavor to prevent	47.74464416503906

20489/28840	I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since said Morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and I of your grief when a carriage rolled into the	40.658119201660156
20490/28840	Never till then had I placed any confidence in presentiments but now I cannot help believing them	188.72080993652344
20491/28840	At the sound of that carriage I shuddered soon I heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don	55.5250244140625
20492/28840	Perhaps I turned pale and trembled but certainly I smiled and five minutes after I left without having heard one word that had	59.58811950683594

20499/28840	The idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to	41.06417465209961
20500/28840	What do you say Maximilian asked	13.158499717712402

20503/28840	You are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear Maximil	40.47150802612305
20504/28840	No no I shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you	67.92906188964844
20505/28840	But to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever   You are right said Morrel	28.487106323242188

20510/28840	What would you have proposed Maximilian had you found me willing to accede   It is not for me to	26.190582275390625
20511/28840	You are wrong you must advise me what to	49.338382720947266
20512/28840	Do you seriously ask my advice Valentine   Certainly dear Maximilian for if it is good I will follow it you know my devotion to	37.70636749267578
20513/28840	Valentine said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my	36.91608428955078
20514/28840	Oh if you refuse my advice   What do you advise said Valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sigh	17.107927322387695
20515/28840	I am free replied Maximilian and rich enough to support	29.089723587036133

20520/28840	Yesif I die   Well Valentine resumed Maximilian I can only say again that you are	32.72500228881836
20521/28840	Truly it is I who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well	101.19261932373047
20522/28840	It is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to	60.5479736328125
20523/28840	I think only that I have known you not a whole	46.53756332397461

20527/28840	It is an everyday occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has	54.99785614013672
20528/28840	Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness Valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her	30.389278411865234
20529/28840	But in a word what are you going to do asked	19.717119216918945
20530/28840	I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your	29.78233528137207

20534/28840	Then adieu Valentine   Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as Morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung	32.09629821777344
20535/28840	I must know what you mean to do said	20.10258674621582

20544/28840	Listen my dear my adored Valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each others	79.93270111083984
20545/28840	I never was romantic and am no melancholy	306.54473876953125

20549/28840	This is what I shall do I will wait until the very moment you are married for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since	31.148637771606445
20550/28840	Franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is	139.3458251953125
20551/28840	30333m       Valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her	22.550838470458984
20552/28840	The young man stood before her sorrowful and res	49.26950454711914
20553/28840	Oh for pitys sake said she you will live will you not   No on my honor said Maximilian but that will not affect	14.390617370605469
20554/28840	You have done your duty and your conscience will be at	42.0418815612793
20555/28840	Valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting	30.73797035217285
20556/28840	Maximilian said she Maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven I entreat you do as I do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be	60.1440544128418

20577/28840	It is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been	27.919416427612305
20578/28840	If we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further	38.13862991333008

20584/28840	My adored Valentine words cannot express one half of my	281.80364990234375
20585/28840	Valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of Morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable	48.84872055053711
20586/28840	Adieu then till we meet again said Valentine tearing herself	110.4395980834961

20589/28840	Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also	47.74961853027344
20590/28840	The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any	57.65215301513672
20591/28840	It was only on the following day at about ten oclock in the morning as he was starting to call on	19.899967193603516
20592/28840	Deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from Valentine although he had not before seen her	68.4112777709961

20601/28840	Morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that	36.40361022949219
20602/28840	Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and heard still	43.33802795410156
20603/28840	Franz had been to announce the ceremony and Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of	54.81866455078125
20604/28840	de SaintMéran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every	60.35579299926758

20606/28840	It is easy to suppose that Morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetrating	28.854957580566406
20607/28840	Monte Cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the point of telling him	34.023109436035156
20608/28840	But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine and kept his	76.85494995117188
20609/28840	The young man read Valentines letter twenty times in the course of the	43.83557891845703
20610/28840	It was her first and on what an occasion Each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her	80.67487335205078
20611/28840	Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say Here I am Maximilian come and help	47.04731750488281
20612/28840	Occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate	67.16724395751953
20613/28840	When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated	116.99958038330078
20614/28840	He shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the	62.89004898071289
20615/28840	Never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on	198.81024169921875
20616/28840	Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at halfpast	63.1744384765625
20617/28840	He then said It is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps Valentine will not wait for	51.14796447753906
20618/28840	Consequently Morrel having left the Rue Meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of SaintPhilippeduRoule was striking	29.638036727905273
20619/28840	The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where Morrel had often	75.13388061523438
20620/28840	The night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper	189.2940216064453
20621/28840	Then Morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be	29.34968376159668
20622/28840	The clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting while Morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the	47.712257385253906
20623/28840	The garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of	59.05520248413086
20624/28840	The house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going	42.3369255065918
20625/28840	Morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking halfpast	59.72759246826172
20626/28840	This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had	65.73128509521484
20627/28840	It was a terrible moment for the young	33.49919128417969
20628/28840	The slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first	44.60665512084961
20629/28840	Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck	157.97662353515625
20630/28840	It is impossible said Maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interrupt	52.3603630065918
20631/28840	I have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have	107.74205780029297
20632/28840	And then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the	53.308353424072266
20633/28840	Had Valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight These were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young	76.56145477294922
20634/28840	The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his	45.14065170288086
20635/28840	In that case said he I should lose her and by my own	64.16742706298828
20636/28840	He dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared	112.98772430419922
20637/28840	He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate	33.2611083984375
20638/28840	It was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other	35.22145080566406
20639/28840	He was on Villeforts premiseshad arrived there by scaling the	50.61298370361328
20640/28840	What might be the consequences However he had not ventured thus far to draw	157.12574768066406
20641/28840	He followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of	73.29373168945312
20642/28840	In a moment he had passed through them and could see the house	52.70705795288086
20643/28840	30341m       Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not	16.500446319580078
20644/28840	Instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble	75.24774932861328
20645/28840	A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second	62.976531982421875
20646/28840	These three windows were in Madame de SaintMérans	25.641292572021484
20647/28840	Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villeforts	30.09505844116211
20648/28840	So many times in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it	64.53263854980469
20649/28840	This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentines absence had	94.72294616699219
20650/28840	At this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motion	73.74860382080078
20651/28840	If it was Valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible	49.340057373046875
20652/28840	The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in	47.32893753051758
20653/28840	They descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as Doctor dAvrign	24.58715057373047
20654/28840	30339m       The young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamoretree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to	30.46323585510254
20655/28840	Who could be dead in that house which Villefort himself had called accursed   My dear	44.51530456542969
20656/28840	de Villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man I have not led you here to console you on the contrary   What can you mean asked the procureur	16.366594314575195
20657/28840	I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still	55.4665641784668
20658/28840	Can it be possible murmured Villefort clasping his	20.17932891845703
20659/28840	What are you going to tell me   Are we quite alone my friend   Yes quite but why all these precautions   Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the	20.689260482788086
20660/28840	The doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his	29.55466651916504
20661/28840	Morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be	30.701204299926758
20662/28840	Dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also	85.29782104492188
20663/28840	Speak doctorI am listening said Villefort strikeI am prepared for everything   Madame de SaintMéran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent	76.39399719238281
20664/28840	Morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten	32.82988357543945
20665/28840	Villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amaz	31.024412155151367
20666/28840	Were you present during the last struggle asked	102.81278991699219
20667/28840	I was replied the procureur you begged me not to	40.60416030883789
20668/28840	Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de SaintMéran has fallen a victim   I	24.235876083374023
20669/28840	Madame de SaintMéran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the	28.62717056274414
20670/28840	Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had	62.256935119628906
20671/28840	This crisis past I endeavored to catch your eye but could	211.04055786132812
20672/28840	You held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards	131.25149536132812
20673/28840	This was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned	61.179344177246094
20674/28840	At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my	62.24574279785156
20675/28840	Yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone   What are you going to say Oh spare me   That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the	22.687698364257812
20676/28840	de Villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motion	35.145233154296875
20677/28840	Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or	59.065956115722656
20678/28840	Listen said the doctor I know the full importance of the statement I have just made and the disposition of the man to whom I have made	33.121734619140625
20679/28840	Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked Ville	23.337858200073242
20680/28840	As a friend and only as a friend at this	48.43135452270508
20681/28840	The similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated I should hesitate I therefore repeat to you I speak not to a magistrate but to a	50.43855667114258
20682/28840	Can it be possible   The symptoms are marked do you seesleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve	95.69534301757812
20683/28840	Madame de SaintMéran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to	26.799907684326172
20684/28840	Oh it is impossible said he I must be dreaming It is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you Tell me I entreat you my dear doctor that you may be	26.518512725830078
20685/28840	Doubtless I may but   But   30345m       But I do not think	19.300912857055664
20686/28840	Have pity on me doctor So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of	48.6484489440918
20687/28840	Has anyone besides me seen Madame de SaintMéran  	32.5265007019043
20688/28840	Has anything been sent for from a chemists that I have not examined  	111.2266845703125
20689/28840	Had Madame de SaintMéran any enemies   Not to my	26.971275329589844
20690/28840	Would her death affect anyones interest   It could not indeed my daughter is her only heiressValentine	127.76194763183594
20691/28840	Oh if such a thought could present itself I would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored	49.430458068847656
20692/28840	dAvrigny I would not accuse anyone I speak only of an accident you understandof a mistakebut whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to	63.50751876831055
20693/28840	Of whomhowof what   May not Barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given Madame de SaintMéran a dose prepared for his master   For my father  	30.851367950439453
20694/28840	But how could a dose prepared for	122.39195251464844
20695/28840	Noirtier poison Madame de SaintMéran   Nothing is more	22.76508903503418
20696/28840	You know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is	136.97120666503906
20697/28840	For instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to	470.2738037109375
20698/28840	Noirtier I resolved to try one last means and for three months I have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six	71.32675170898438
20699/28840	This quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of	82.2984848022461
20700/28840	Noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another	69.87976837158203
20701/28840	My dear doctor there is no communication between	74.66305541992188
20702/28840	Noirtiers apartment and that of Madame de SaintMéran and Barrois never entered my motherinlaws	19.436283111572266
20703/28840	In short doctor although I know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although I place the utmost reliance in you I want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom _errare humanum est	75.37239837646484
20704/28840	Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself   Why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish   Send for him I will tell him what I have seen and we will consult together and examine the	34.21918869018555
20705/28840	Let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with	51.89097595214844
20706/28840	Pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest I should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know	44.70471954345703
20707/28840	Doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you   My dear	80.52021789550781
20708/28840	de Villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to	61.97587966918945
20709/28840	I would have saved Madame de SaintMéran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the	42.88283920288086
20710/28840	Let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts I am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my	69.9167251586914
20711/28840	Meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop	348.4526062011719
20712/28840	And when you have found the culprit if you find him I will say to you You are a magistrate do as you will   I thank you doctor said Villefort with indescribable joy I never had a better friend than	21.008634567260742
20713/28840	And as if he feared Doctor dAvrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the	25.70969581604004
20714/28840	When they were gone Morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a	43.95806121826172
20715/28840	I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but Valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow   As he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white	57.90446472167969
20716/28840	The light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the	63.137245178222656
20717/28840	At the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows	25.554527282714844
20718/28840	A waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the	85.325439453125
20719/28840	Morrel shuddered he thought he heard a	21.644664764404297
20720/28840	It cannot be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious	92.35796356201172
20721/28840	Although it was impossible that Valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him	76.04204559326172
20722/28840	Her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards	78.69061279296875
20723/28840	Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her	273.1965026855469
20724/28840	Meanwhile Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of	39.030601501464844
20725/28840	de Villefort even would not have alarmed	29.925342559814453
20726/28840	He was quite prepared for any such	115.1990737915039
20727/28840	He would at once approach Valentines father and acknowledge all begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving	122.16804504394531
20728/28840	Now especially did he find the description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to	62.28962326049805
20729/28840	He turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in	98.79266357421875
20730/28840	He pushed the door open and	38.33098602294922
20731/28840	At the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly	48.806610107421875
20732/28840	By its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easychair was Valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and	39.262577056884766
20733/28840	She had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utter	54.31717300415039
20734/28840	The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole	60.267757415771484
20735/28840	Morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but Valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in	51.03921890258789
20736/28840	He sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a Magdalen by Correggiowas raised and turned towards	68.2606430053711
20737/28840	Valentine perceived him without betraying the least	33.17900848388672
20738/28840	A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor	196.29025268554688
20739/28840	Morrel held out his hand to	14.105626106262207
20740/28840	Valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob	61.529449462890625
20741/28840	Neither dared for some time to speak in that	71.85873413085938
20742/28840	They hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length Valentine	155.40110778808594
20743/28840	My friend said she how came you here Alas I would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this	133.8722381591797
20744/28840	Valentine said Morrel with a trembling voice I had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come I became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event   What voices asked	44.65447235107422
20745/28840	Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and	16.357593536376953
20746/28840	de Villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple	41.863121032714844
20747/28840	Your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them I learned it	77.29737854003906
20748/28840	But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here	154.38775634765625
20749/28840	Forgive me replied Morrel I will go	22.759836196899414
20750/28840	No said Valentine you might meet someone	324.66937255859375
20751/28840	But if anyone should come here   The young girl shook her	14.100226402282715
20752/28840	No one will come said she do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the	78.96623992919922

20755/28840	Alas said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed	44.01557159423828
20756/28840	They both listened steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the	108.1705551147461
20757/28840	It is my father who has just left his	26.68331527709961

20759/28840	How do you know it is the doctor asked Valentine	44.546390533447266
20760/28840	I imagined it must be said Mor	51.41431427001953
20761/28840	Valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then	29.491071701049805
20762/28840	de Villefort locked the garden door and returned	57.093929290771484
20763/28840	He stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de SaintMérans Morrel concealed himself behind a door Valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all	37.66715621948242
20764/28840	de Villefort passed on to his own	25.572233200073242
20765/28840	Now said Valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the	38.433204650878906
20766/28840	There is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfathers	88.09619140625
20767/28840	Can you mean it Valentine   I have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help	126.77034759521484
20768/28840	Be careful Valentine said Morrel hesitating to comply with the young girls wishes I now see my errorI acted like a madman in coming in	53.32814407348633
20769/28840	Are you sure you are more reasonable   Yes said Valentine and I have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which I had undertaken to	35.856529235839844
20770/28840	Valentine said Morrel death is in itself	60.43695068359375
20771/28840	Yes said Valentine besides it will not be for	64.91476440429688
20772/28840	She then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to	53.19353103637695
20773/28840	Noirtiers room Morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old	23.875577926635742
20774/28840	Barrois said Valentine shut the door and let no one come	42.47633361816406
20775/28840	Noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw Valentine and his eye bright	36.49806594848633
20776/28840	There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrog	54.93644332885742
20777/28840	said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now I have no friend in the world but	51.49079895019531
20778/28840	His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tender	120.26322937011719
20779/28840	To you alone then may I confide my sorrows and my hopes   The paralytic motioned	53.89789962768555
20780/28840	The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Mor	29.531803131103516
20781/28840	Maximilian Morrel said she the son of that good merchant of Marseilles whom you doubtless recol	26.07362174987793
20782/28840	He brings an irreproachable name which Maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the Legion of	31.937965393066406
20783/28840	The old man signified that he recollected	29.89317512512207
20784/28840	Well grandpapa said Valentine kneeling before him and pointing to Maximilian I love him and will be only his were I compelled to marry another I would destroy	52.32470703125
20785/28840	The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous	32.47773361206055
20786/28840	Maximilian Morrel do you not grandpapa asked	11.23926067352295
20787/28840	And you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father   Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel as if to say perhaps I	29.210790634155273
20788/28840	Mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmothers room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with	28.01100730895996
20789/28840	Noirtier   That is it said the old mans	22.097320556640625
20790/28840	Do you fear he will not understand  	32.95309829711914
20791/28840	Oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how I talk to	45.81731033325195
20792/28840	Then turning to Maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrowHe knows everything I know said	59.822479248046875
20793/28840	Valentine arose placed a chair for Morrel requested Barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel she went	55.033634185791016
20794/28840	To prove to Noirtier that he was in Valentines confidence and knew all their secrets Morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a	51.947235107421875
20795/28840	But first said Morrel allow me sir to tell you who I am how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine and what are my designs respecting	31.30226707458496
20796/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he would	15.240848541259766
20797/28840	It was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and	173.66444396972656
20798/28840	His remarkably noble and austere expression struck Morrel who began his story with	151.97296142578125
20799/28840	He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine and how he had loved her and that Valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his	41.26577377319336
20800/28840	He told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered That is good	145.91184997558594
20801/28840	And now said Morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now I have told you of my love and my hopes may I inform you of my intentions   Yes signified the old	22.512643814086914
20802/28840	This was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sisters house to marry her and to wait respectfully	53.982948303222656
20803/28840	We must not do so  	20.94276237487793
20804/28840	You do not sanction our project  	44.108924865722656
20805/28840	The old mans interrogative eye said Which   I will go continued Maximilian I will seek	37.38996124267578
20806/28840	Franz dÉpinayI am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villeforts absenceand will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge	42.85977554321289
20807/28840	You wish to know what I will do  	16.56740951538086
20808/28840	I will find him as I told	18.951562881469727
20809/28840	Noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful	55.13060760498047
20810/28840	Still when Morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying	58.40382385253906
20811/28840	No said Morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first   I do signified the old	26.59478759765625
20812/28840	But what then must be done asked Mor	36.20195007324219
20813/28840	Madame de SaintMérans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must I let things take their course Noirtier did not	37.160831451416016
20814/28840	I understand said Morrel I am to	30.338424682617188
20815/28840	But delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young	72.20157623291016
20816/28840	Alone Valentine has no power she will be compelled to	89.9042739868164
20817/28840	I am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur	54.76295852661133
20818/28840	Believe me there are only the two plans I have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you	80.06987762451172
20819/28840	Do you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor  	24.60084342956543
20820/28840	Do you prefer I should seek	198.175048828125
20821/28840	Whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed Mor	504.1907653808594
20822/28840	You thoroughly understand me sir Pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your	93.22474670410156
20823/28840	Will our help come from you  	96.45807647705078
20824/28840	You are sure of it  	16.911317825317383
20825/28840	There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his	107.03218078613281
20826/28840	Then I must wait asked the young	44.51679229736328
20827/28840	But the contract The same smile	417.95635986328125
20828/28840	Will you assure me it shall not be signed   Yes said Noirt	24.077781677246094
20829/28840	The contract shall not be signed cried Mor	69.1882553100586
20830/28840	Oh pardon me sir I can scarcely realize so great a	85.57362365722656
20831/28840	Will they not sign it   No said the paraly	63.559837341308594
20832/28840	This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled	43.04543685913086
20833/28840	Whether Noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at	19.921443939208984
20834/28840	What do you wish sir asked Morrel that I should renew my promise of remaining tranquil Noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his	37.6485710144043
20835/28840	Shall I swear to you sir asked Maximil	19.31744384765625
20836/28840	Yes said the paralytic with the same solemn	16.564340591430664
20837/28840	Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an	42.48234176635742
20838/28840	I swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course I am to pursue with	35.71156692504883
20839/28840	That is right said the old	25.420900344848633
20840/28840	Now said Morrel do you wish me to retire  	11.47168254852295
20841/28840	Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine  	12.201437950134277
20842/28840	Morrel made a sign that he was ready to	11.305209159851074
20843/28840	But said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just	53.32943344116211
20844/28840	The young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where Valentines had	39.15241622924805
20845/28840	Then he bowed a second time and	69.55908966064453
20846/28840	He found outside the door the old servant to whom Valentine had given	72.89556121826172
20847/28840	He got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay threw himself on his bed and slept sound	34.81549072265625
20848/28840	The Villefort Family Vault   Two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten oclock in the morning around the door of	20.77695083618164
20849/28840	de Villeforts house and a long file of mourningcoaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg SaintHonoré and the Rue de la Pépini	17.0446720123291
20850/28840	Among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a	41.341552734375
20851/28840	It was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to	59.35170364379883
20852/28840	Inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de SaintMéran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow	65.11804962158203
20853/28840	The Marquis de SaintMéran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XV	12.081120491027832
20854/28840	had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on formed a considerable	94.38146209716797
20855/28840	Due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same	37.045597076416016
20856/28840	A second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to	45.18592834472656
20857/28840	de Villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the post	57.14775085449219
20858/28840	The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of PèreLachaise where	34.627838134765625
20859/28840	de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his	38.87078857421875
20860/28840	The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with	48.12556838989258
20861/28840	The Parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracythe greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their	94.29410552978516
20862/28840	In one of the mourningcoaches Beauchamp Debray and ChâteauRenaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchion	11.945581436157227
20863/28840	How old was she   Franz assured me replied Albert that she was sixtysix years	29.361371994018555
20864/28840	But she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her	38.10846710205078
20865/28840	But of what disease then did she die asked Debr	49.22666931152344
20866/28840	It is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not  	27.199234008789062
20867/28840	It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said Beauch	20.120649337768555
20868/28840	Madame de SaintMéran whom I once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de SaintMé	26.64986801147461
20869/28840	At any rate said Albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her	245.16119384765625
20870/28840	de Villefort or rather Mademoiselle Valentineor still rather our friend Franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting I believe to 80000 livres per ann	32.37736892700195
20871/28840	And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin Noirt	18.83526611328125
20872/28840	That is a tenacious old grandfather said Beauch	77.88034057617188
20873/28840	I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to	62.645729064941406

20876/28840	Ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep	217.18441772460938
20877/28840	Ideas and men appeared the same to him said	240.6202850341797
20878/28840	One thing only puzzles me namely how Franz dÉpinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his	70.55425262451172
20879/28840	But where is Franz   In the first carriage with	36.42233657836914

20881/28840	40024m       Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which	66.09722900390625
20882/28840	dAvrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to	42.714473724365234
20883/28840	They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral	110.02645111083984
20884/28840	Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault ChâteauRenaud recognized Morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yewt	27.00029182434082

20887/28840	Albert came up to them at this moment with	107.72396850585938
20888/28840	The time and place are but illsuited for an	346.09576416015625
20889/28840	said Albert but we are not superst	79.47992706298828

20893/28840	Morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to	38.676841735839844
20894/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said Debray to	10.360033988952637
20895/28840	Extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning I scarcely knew	132.29737854003906

20940/28840	Scarcely had the door closed when	108.140380859375
20941/28840	de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawingroom in half an hour as he expected the notary and	29.252208709716797
20942/28840	The news caused a great sensation throughout the house Madame de Villefort would not believe it and Valentine was thunderstru	36.46162414550781
20943/28840	She looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but on the stairs she met	39.18489456176758
20944/28840	de Villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing	11.13838005065918
20945/28840	In the anteroom Valentine met Barrois and looked despairingly at the old	21.70296859741211
20946/28840	A moment later Madame de Villefort entered the drawingroom with her little	21.075252532958984
20947/28840	It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatig	32.13717269897461
20948/28840	She sat down took Edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bos	44.42558670043945

20950/28840	One was the notarys the other that of Franz and his	63.985260009765625
20951/28840	In a moment the whole party was	73.3884048461914
20952/28840	Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her	29.438995361328125
20953/28840	ChâteauRenaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to	22.085416793823242
20954/28840	Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her	26.81784439086914
20955/28840	The notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards Franz   Are you	54.04309844970703
20956/28840	Franz de Quesnel baron dÉpinay asked he although he knew it	51.287818908691406
20957/28840	I have then to inform you sir at the request of	39.61504364013672
20958/28840	de Villefort that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of	13.589365005493164
20959/28840	Noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left	32.828453063964844
20960/28840	Let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and	74.75753784179688
20961/28840	dÉpinay that during my lifetime my fathers will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be	68.72087097167969
20962/28840	40032m       Sir said Franz I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine I have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds	24.17839813232422
20963/28840	My family has sought consideration in this alliance with	273.7503356933594
20964/28840	de Villefort all I seek is	177.57740783691406
20965/28840	Valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her	38.680965423583984
20966/28840	Besides sir said Villefort addressing himself to his future soninlaw excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you	43.49150466918945
20967/28840	Noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains	255.73963928222656
20968/28840	It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same	38.21773147583008
20969/28840	Old age is selfish sir and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to	21.677406311035156
20970/28840	Noirtier which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness dÉpin	29.269662857055664
20971/28840	My fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married	58.06449508666992
20972/28840	Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended	56.1152229309082
20973/28840	de Villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and Barrois	19.352294921875

20975/28840	Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to	22.927490234375

20979/28840	dÉpinay cannot leave the drawingroom at	61.527862548828125

20983/28840	However his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the	78.12884521484375
20984/28840	Nortier resumed Villefort that what he demands is	158.85037231445312
20985/28840	Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied Barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing	87.56916046142578
20986/28840	Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame de Villeforts count	26.85567855834961
20987/28840	Valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank	22.24640464782715
20988/28840	de Villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers	52.8051872253418
20989/28840	Valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when	38.08406066894531
20990/28840	Stop said he I will go with	16.70256805419922
20991/28840	Excuse me sir said Franz since	165.7086181640625
20992/28840	Noirtier sent for me I am ready to attend to his wish besides I shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing	26.341875076293945
20993/28840	Pray sir said Villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb	26.86613655090332
20994/28840	40032m       Forgive me sir said Franz in a resolute	18.720029830932617
20995/28840	I would not lose this opportunity of proving to	50.04319381713867
20996/28840	Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which I am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my	75.7488784790039
20997/28840	And without listening to Villefort he arose and followed Valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling	29.469051361083984
20998/28840	ChâteauRenaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing	22.275634765625
20999/28840	A Signed Statement   Noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his arm	27.80980682373047
21000/28840	When the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately	78.82719421386719
21001/28840	Listen whispered Villefort to Valentine who could not conceal her joy if	44.80204391479492
21002/28840	Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage I forbid you to understand	92.36853790283203
21003/28840	Franz dÉpinay said he you requested to see	91.42227172851562
21004/28840	We have all wished for this interview and I trust it will convince you how illformed are your objections to Valentines	61.01913070678711
21005/28840	Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villeforts blood run	66.97803497314453
21006/28840	In a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a	47.9945068359375
21007/28840	Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the	24.452600479125977
21008/28840	She opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless	62.86261749267578
21009/28840	Shall I open the secretaire asked	154.4959259033203
21010/28840	Those at the side  	56.514312744140625
21011/28840	Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of	16.693086624145508
21012/28840	Is that what you wish for asked	73.99199676513672
21013/28840	She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was	192.15489196777344
21014/28840	But there are no more said	106.35721588134766
21015/28840	Noirtiers eye was fixed on the	26.928050994873047
21016/28840	Yes I understand grandfather said the young	36.54036331176758
21017/28840	40036m       She pointed to each letter of the	56.44275665283203
21018/28840	At the letter S the old man stopped	225.6397247314453
21019/28840	She opened and found the word	549.242431640625
21020/28840	Ah is there a secret spring said	110.50492095947266
21021/28840	And who knows it Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone	25.654409408569336
21022/28840	Shall I call him  	34.81974792480469
21023/28840	Valentine went to the door and called Barro	10.455650329589844
21024/28840	Villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and Franz was stupef	27.1590576171875
21025/28840	Barrois said Valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you knowwill you open it   Barrois looked at the old	30.22406578063965
21026/28840	Barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black	78.58130645751953
21027/28840	Is that what you wish for said Barro	34.699947357177734
21028/28840	Shall I give these papers to	118.61769104003906
21029/28840	Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover read   To be given after my death to General Durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important	69.91429138183594
21030/28840	Well sir asked Franz what do you wish me to do with this paper   To preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procure	22.00074577331543
21031/28840	Do you wish him to read it said	34.989540100097656
21032/28840	You understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said	59.59283447265625
21033/28840	Then let us sit down said Villefort impatiently for it will take some	27.123170852661133
21034/28840	Villefort took a chair but Valentine remained standing by her fathers side and Franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his	52.382789611816406
21035/28840	February 5th 1815 said he it is the day my father was	39.29010009765625
21036/28840	Valentine and Villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly Go	26.314130783081055
21037/28840	But it was on leaving this club said he my father	95.37054443359375
21038/28840	had just granted to him with his estate of Épin	62.91815185546875
21039/28840	400340m       A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5	32.67507553100586
21040/28840	The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o	42.400115966796875
21041/28840	The meetings were always held from that time till	192.73658752441406
21042/28840	General de Quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they	83.93864440917969
21043/28840	The generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he	64.47059631347656
21044/28840	What must be done then asked the	46.068050384521484
21045/28840	I have my carriage here said the	32.4454231262207
21046/28840	Have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know   Our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a StateCouncill	25.582944869995117
21047/28840	Then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being	159.15689086914062
21048/28840	We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came	67.63909912109375
21049/28840	When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no	57.05155944824219
21050/28840	On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his	43.39982986450195
21051/28840	The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue SaintJac	21.660694122314453
21052/28840	The general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly	58.830406188964844
21053/28840	The members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in	41.9769287109375
21054/28840	When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many wellknown faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been	41.61496353149414
21055/28840	And hence said Villefort arose my affection for your father my dear	68.38017272949219
21056/28840	Opinions held in common are a ready bond of	987.7833862304688
21057/28840	Franz continued   The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but	79.7514419555664
21058/28840	de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with	58.01515197753906
21059/28840	He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their	19.426010131835938

21062/28840	When the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brow	113.0458755493164
21063/28840	Well asked the president what do you say to this letter general   I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XV	34.32452392578125
21064/28840	to break my vow in behalf of the exem	115.85400390625
21065/28840	This answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his	173.6033477783203
21066/28840	General said the president we acknowledge no King Louis XV	66.59378814697266

21068/28840	Excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge Louis XV	94.04767608642578
21069/28840	but I do as he has made me a baron and a fieldmarshal and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his happy return to	32.03987503051758

21077/28840	Villefort walked to and fro behind	38.66938781738281

21079/28840	Franz returned to the manuscript and continued   Sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou	51.22231674194336
21080/28840	When you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XV	53.27568435668945
21081/28840	or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the	44.63197326660156
21082/28840	It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in	35.822479248046875
21083/28840	No no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the	59.70162582397461
21084/28840	I am a royalist replied the general I have taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XV	23.698312759399414
21085/28840	These words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rash	34.83372116088867
21086/28840	The president again arose and having imposed silence saidSir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer	63.32916259765625
21087/28840	The general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedIf you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by	95.90648651123047

21092/28840	A significant silence followed these words and as the general did not replyClose the doors said the president to the door	77.69488525390625
21093/28840	40042m       The same deadly silence succeeded these	44.3005256652832
21094/28840	Then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelingsI have a son said he and I ought to think of him finding myself among	61.54098129272461
21095/28840	General said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyit is the privilege of	142.95046997070312

21098/28840	The general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskWhat is the form said	72.05348205566406
21099/28840	It is thisI swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February 1815 between nine and ten oclock in the evening and I plead guilty of death should I ever violate this	32.6555290222168

21102/28840	One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them	38.77548599243164

21113/28840	Now if you please remove your band	65.84339904785156
21114/28840	The general tore the handkerchief from his	40.21601104736328
21115/28840	At last said he I shall know with whom I have to	32.468536376953125
21116/28840	They opened the door and the four men alight	16.96678924560547

21118/28840	Valentine clasped her hands as if in	22.72247314453125
21119/28840	Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and	11.946538925170898
21120/28840	Franz continued   It was as we said the fifth of	89.35234832763672
21121/28840	For three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with	35.02890396118164
21122/28840	The general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting	114.7203598022461
21123/28840	The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and	58.15272521972656
21124/28840	One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coalbarge near and by its light they examined the	90.98133850097656

21126/28840	The general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own	69.34015655517578
21127/28840	The witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be	108.34130859375
21128/28840	The lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel	66.90765380859375
21129/28840	The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so	94.36795806884766
21130/28840	40044m       General dÉpinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and	35.16353225708008
21131/28840	The witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to	49.399261474609375
21132/28840	The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his	147.22344970703125
21133/28840	But his opponent did not allow his guard to be	179.65487670898438
21134/28840	He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the	53.20392990112305
21135/28840	They thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with	65.7737045288086
21136/28840	The general who had almost fainted	110.93673706054688
21137/28840	Ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with	32.81125259399414
21138/28840	The president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third	54.69969940185547
21139/28840	Still he had not even uttered a	19.933496475219727

21141/28840	The general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been	139.4677276611328
21142/28840	In proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of	52.66421890258789
21143/28840	Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door Valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfathers answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few	54.5489616394043

21149/28840	Franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to	84.3182601928711
21150/28840	At that letter the old man signified	224.95164489746094
21151/28840	The young mans finger glided over the words but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative	91.84597778320312
21152/28840	Valentine hid her head between her	37.275611877441406
21153/28840	At length Franz arrived at the word MYS	219.42611694335938

21158/28840	Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria but at the gamingtable of the baths of Lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous court	43.27558517456055
21159/28840	He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of	67.90797424316406
21160/28840	Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva Corsin	25.098451614379883
21161/28840	He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be	70.73851776123047
21162/28840	Besides what is required of a young man in Paris To speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in	65.19596862792969
21163/28840	They are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a	170.2354736328125
21164/28840	Andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair	420.9924621582031

21166/28840	A learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of	98.64659118652344
21167/28840	Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our readers when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay	74.1498794555664
21168/28840	Danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the	21.871726989746094
21169/28840	It was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at Auteuil and the events which followed it that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristos name	32.745357513427734
21170/28840	If he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars soon dispelled every impression of	64.02506256103516
21171/28840	It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested enduseless injury is repugnant to every	100.0453109741211

21173/28840	Cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his	66.43408966064453
21174/28840	The latter took in the whole scene at a	99.63408660888672
21175/28840	The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa Eugénie sat near her and Cavalcanti was	21.466381072998047
21176/28840	This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle Danglars and by sighs launched in the same	28.67333984375
21177/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars was still the samecold beautiful and	10.457138061523438

21180/28840	It was then especially while conversing with Madame Danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed	39.32301330566406
21181/28840	Andrea Cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his	90.98185729980469
21182/28840	His first look was certainly directed towards Monte Cristo but the second was for	64.90087127685547
21183/28840	As for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal	72.9311294555664
21184/28840	Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said Danglars to	46.486000061035156
21185/28840	Alas no sir replied Andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former	41.143455505371094
21186/28840	Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened	7.8030195236206055

21188/28840	Mademoiselle dArmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with Eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so	16.3631649017334
21189/28840	She was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins and her eyes dull from	64.73101043701172
21190/28840	She was said to have a weak chest and like Antonia in the _Cremona Violin_ she would die one day while	104.00711059570312
21191/28840	Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle dArmilly of whom he had heard	28.15074920654297
21192/28840	The count soon heard Andreas voice singing a Corsican song accompanied by the	117.43505096435547
21193/28840	The praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the barons countenance would not have led him to suspect	51.14439010620117
21194/28840	Hem thought Monte Cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of	102.3322982788086
21195/28840	Danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses	31.248043060302734

21216/28840	You may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings	90.88378143310547
21217/28840	But should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be disple	48.91941452026367
21218/28840	Albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like Eugénie	50.74296951293945
21219/28840	Besides I care not for his	174.1319580078125
21220/28840	Still situated as we are   Yes do you know how we are situated At his mothers ball he danced once with Eugénie and	69.0101318359375
21221/28840	Cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of	105.35225677490234
21222/28840	The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcer	10.752379417419434
21223/28840	The baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when Danglars stopped	21.284934997558594
21224/28840	Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what	133.3776092529297
21225/28840	Albert entered looking very handsome and in high	292.0527038574219
21226/28840	He bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to Danglars and affectionately to Monte Crist	16.414085388183594
21227/28840	Then turning to the baroness May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is said	13.717844009399414
21228/28840	She is quite well replied Danglars quickly she is at the piano with	22.3904972076416
21229/28840	Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew Monte Cristos eye was on	104.5726318359375
21230/28840	Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and Mademoiselle Eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like Thal	101.33187866210938
21231/28840	The concert must be a delightful	175.39553833007812
21232/28840	They suit each other remarkably well said Dangl	26.378145217895508
21233/28840	Albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that Madame Danglars bl	33.52898025512695
21234/28840	I too said the young man am a musicianat least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than	55.53757095336914
21235/28840	Danglars smiled and seemed to say It is of no	18.668167114257812
21236/28840	Then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he saidThe prince and my daughter were universally admired	173.7264862060547
21237/28840	You were not of the party	65.31929016113281
21238/28840	de Morcerf   What prince asked	33.954986572265625
21239/28840	Prince Cavalcanti said Danglars who persisted in giving the young man that	30.045305252075195
21240/28840	Pardon me said Albert I was not aware that he was a	23.069154739379883
21241/28840	And Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugénie yesterday It must have been charming	26.017057418823242
21242/28840	But I was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of ChâteauRen	32.44266891479492
21243/28840	This was followed by rather an awkward	143.993408203125
21244/28840	Bravo bravi brava The banker was enthusiastic in his	352.7496032714844
21245/28840	40054m       Indeed said Albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti	26.825927734375
21246/28840	You said prince did you not But he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in	105.91963195800781
21247/28840	But to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat Danglars without telling them there is a	42.48184585571289
21248/28840	Ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by	82.98261260986328
21249/28840	Danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans	16.219648361206055
21250/28840	What do you think of our lover said	39.47183609008789
21251/28840	Yes doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does	36.488407135009766
21252/28840	See him there cold as marble and proud like his	375.0347595214844
21253/28840	If he were rich if he had Cavalcantis fortune that might be pard	66.67503356933594
21254/28840	Why do you doubt   The pastthat obscurity on the	76.25846099853516
21255/28840	But that does not affect the	98.27484893798828
21256/28840	Now I beg of you dont go off your	75.4019775390625
21257/28840	Its a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young Cavalcanti whom I do not really know at	36.21631622314453
21258/28840	Have you made inquiry   Is there any need of that Does not his appearance speak for him And he is very	97.62735748291016
21259/28840	I am not so sure of	15.623607635498047
21260/28840	And yet you said he had	227.71511840820312
21261/28840	Hem said Monte Cristo in his	33.25010299682617
21262/28840	Come count you do not do that young man	64.66413116455078
21263/28840	Well I acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the Morcerf family to see him throw himself in the	102.39482116699219
21264/28840	What a Puritan you are said he that happens every	65.03361511230469
21265/28840	But you cannot break it off in this way the Morcerfs are depending on this	59.6207160949707
21266/28840	Then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the	84.6607437133789
21267/28840	Iwhere the devil did you find out that   At their ball it was apparent	48.55783462524414
21268/28840	But let it be done explicitly and	90.72582244873047
21269/28840	If he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or	107.14733123779297
21270/28840	Yes sir I will give my attention to the	25.078350067138672
21271/28840	I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision but I do await	44.48906326293945
21272/28840	A banker must you know be a slave to his	235.47698974609375
21273/28840	Cavalcanti had done half an hour	179.318603515625
21274/28840	Bravi bravo brava cried Morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an	100.49263763427734
21275/28840	Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to	14.828476905822754
21276/28840	I shall soon return said the banker to Monte Cristo wait for	39.12266159057617
21277/28840	I shall perhaps have something to say to	19.688112258911133
21278/28840	The baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and	33.64817428588867
21279/28840	Andrea who was sitting before the piano with Mademoiselle Eugénie started up like a jackinthe	44.06660461425781
21280/28840	Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual cool	16.79929542541504
21281/28840	Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to Morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look	64.00274658203125
21282/28840	Then Albert launched out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous	32.0162239074707
21283/28840	Cavalcanti being left alone turned to Monte Crist	161.8653564453125
21284/28840	Come said Madame Danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take	31.4622859954834
21285/28840	Come Louise said Mademoiselle Danglars to her	13.046648025512695
21286/28840	They passed into the next drawingroom where tea was	50.200435638427734
21287/28840	Just as they were beginning in the English fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and Danglars entered visibly	28.813508987426758
21288/28840	Monte Cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an	151.13475036621094
21289/28840	I have just received my courier from Greece said Dangl	22.061241149902344
21290/28840	Ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from	33.00857162475586
21291/28840	How is King Otho getting on asked Albert in the most sprightly	79.8465347290039
21292/28840	Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a	32.16815185546875
21293/28840	We shall go together shall we not said Albert to the	51.185401916503906
21294/28840	I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo while the father talks to	20.004697799682617
21295/28840	If you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said Monte Crist	59.04168701171875
21296/28840	My dear viscount you are dreadfully impert	27.494272232055664
21297/28840	Meanwhile Danglars stooping to Monte Cristos ear Your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yan	44.042354583740234
21298/28840	Yes I will tell you all but take away the young man I cannot endure his	38.384037017822266
21299/28840	Shall I send the father to you  	69.25345611572266
21300/28840	Haydée   Scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when Albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughtermuch too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and	30.386945724487305
21301/28840	Well said he I will ask you the same question which Charles	32.98194885253906
21302/28840	put to Catherine de Medici after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew How have I played my little part   To what do you allude asked Monte Crist	46.13736343383789
21303/28840	To the installation of my rival at	98.9189453125
21304/28840	What rival   _Ma foi_ what rival Why your protégé	48.183502197265625
21305/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti   Ah no joking viscount if you please I do not patronize	45.51633834838867
21306/28840	And you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with	57.92849349975586
21307/28840	What do you think he is paying his addresses   I am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his	27.885574340820312
21308/28840	He aspires to the hand of the proud Eugé	43.10976791381836
21309/28840	What does that signify so long as they favor your suit   But it is not the case my dear count on the	31.695533752441406
21310/28840	What   It is so indeed Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely answers me and Mademoiselle dArmilly her confidant does not speak to me at	12.872749328613281
21311/28840	But the father has the greatest regard possible for you said Monte Crist	51.343807220458984
21312/28840	He Oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedyweapons I own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and	93.27272033691406
21313/28840	Of whomof Debray   No of	84.17549133300781
21314/28840	Of me I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against	54.121185302734375
21315/28840	Do you wish me to do so  	7.4280853271484375
21316/28840	Well I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the bar	17.96982192993164
21317/28840	By whom are you charged   By the baron	45.56843566894531
21318/28840	Oh said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was	61.072486877441406
21319/28840	You surely will not do that my dear count   Certainly I shall Albert as I have promised to do	41.250823974609375
21320/28840	Well said Albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry	19.235408782958984
21321/28840	I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said Monte Crist	19.280004501342773
21322/28840	But apropos of Debray how is it that I have not seen him lately at the barons house   There has been a	21.530132293701172
21323/28840	What with the baroness   No with the bar	17.756305694580078
21324/28840	Has he perceived anything   Ah that is a good joke   Do you think he suspects said Monte Cristo with charming art	30.471561431884766
21325/28840	Where have you come from my dear count said	31.200925827026367
21326/28840	It must be farther off than even	275.5962829589844
21327/28840	But what do I know of your Parisian husbands   Oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole	67.93434143066406
21328/28840	But then what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray They seemed to understand each other so well said Monte Cristo with renewed	32.93178176879883
21329/28840	Ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis in which I am not	36.63515853881836
21330/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that	100.43807220458984
21331/28840	Here we are said Monte Cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come	21.206939697265625
21332/28840	No thank you I gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow	38.072837829589844
21333/28840	There it is then said Monte Cristo as he stepped out of the	15.435864448547363
21334/28840	They both went into the house the drawingroom was lighted upthey went in	52.32331085205078
21335/28840	You will make tea for us Baptistin said the	59.12696838378906
21336/28840	Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy	118.99272155761719
21337/28840	What you say is perhaps true they know my	179.80810546875
21338/28840	For instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime   _Ma foi_ I should like to	34.23717498779297
21339/28840	Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it	109.88640594482422
21340/28840	In about the space of a second a private door opened and Ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent lat	39.817142486572266
21341/28840	Oh no it is as simple as possible replied Monte Crist	39.530887603759766
21342/28840	Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youAh but what do I hear and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a	61.0799446105957
21343/28840	_Ma foi_ my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars piano to be attacked by Haydées guz	19.640989303588867
21344/28840	Haydéewhat an adorable name Are there then really women who bear the name of Haydée anywhere but in Byrons poems   Certainly there	56.12175369262695
21345/28840	Haydée is a very uncommon name in France but is common enough in Albania and Epirus it is as if you said for example Chastity Modesty Innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you Parisians call	60.40854263305664
21346/28840	And you think she would be angry   No certainly not said the count with a haughty	14.664024353027344
21347/28840	She is very amiable then is she not said	116.45783996582031
21348/28840	It is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a	75.47183227539062
21349/28840	Are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name   Und	88.40414428710938
21350/28840	Really count you do nothing and have nothing like other	187.90869140625
21351/28840	The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo Why it is a rank of itself in France and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a	25.196331024169922
21352/28840	A hundred thousand francs The poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the _Thousand and One Nights_ would seem but	40.326847076416016
21353/28840	You are right and she is one of the greatest in her country	50.24641418457031
21354/28840	You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina do you not   Of Ali Tepelini13 Oh yes it was in his service that my father made his	24.920236587524414
21355/28840	40062m       Well what is Haydée to Ali Tepelini   Merely his	17.186616897583008
21356/28840	What the daughter of Ali Pasha   Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasil	16.494403839111328
21357/28840	And your slave   _Ma foi_	10.547167778015137
21358/28840	But how did she become so   Why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as I was passing through the market at	55.971717834472656
21359/28840	Wonderful Really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when I listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking	74.1449966430664
21360/28840	Now I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but   Say	32.29121398925781
21361/28840	But since you go out with Haydée and sometimes even take her to the Opera   Well   I think I may venture to ask you this	30.38315773010254
21362/28840	You may venture to ask me	68.81209564208984
21363/28840	Well then my dear count present me to your	61.63140106201172
21364/28840	I will do so but on two	60.77057647705078
21365/28840	The first is that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the	95.14293670654297
21366/28840	Very well said Albert extending his hand I swear I will	41.1636962890625
21367/28840	The second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served	82.3563461303711
21368/28840	I give you my oath that I will	17.13736915588379
21369/28840	Enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not But I know you to be a man of	44.701969146728516
21370/28840	Tell Haydée said he that I will take coffee with her and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my friends to	31.447275161743164
21371/28840	Now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear Morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and I will ask	39.06108856201172
21372/28840	Ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass	34.713096618652344
21373/28840	Let us go in said Monte Crist	30.159231185913086
21374/28840	Albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and	43.8206672668457
21375/28840	Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three French attendants commanded by Myrth	73.78556823730469
21376/28840	Haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawing	54.959083557128906
21377/28840	Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except Monte Cristo had been accorded an entrance into her	46.541114807128906
21378/28840	She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped	34.32951354980469
21379/28840	Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its	68.2142105102539
21380/28840	On perceiving Monte Cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest	37.042301177978516
21381/28840	Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her	46.68647766113281
21382/28840	Whom do you bring asked the young girl in Romaic of Monte Cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an	51.55039978027344
21383/28840	A friend said Monte Cristo in the same	30.680328369140625
21384/28840	What is his name   Count Albert it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the banditti at	18.127363204956055
21385/28840	In what language would you like me to converse with him   Monte Cristo turned to	21.054405212402344
21386/28840	Do you know modern Greek asked	97.22637939453125
21387/28840	Alas no said Albert nor even ancient Greek my dear count never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than	90.45722198486328
21388/28840	Then said Haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristos question and Alberts answer then I will speak either in French or Italian if my lord so wills	45.37017059326172
21389/28840	You will speak in Italian said	186.1421356201172
21390/28840	The count made a sign to Haydée to address his	28.795392990112305
21391/28840	Sir she said to Morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and	27.11223793029785
21392/28840	This was said in excellent Tuscan and with that soft Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of	55.87404251098633
21393/28840	Then turning to Ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to	48.103336334228516
21394/28840	Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of	46.84030532836914
21395/28840	Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to	66.94467163085938
21396/28840	Baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to	257.7556457519531
21397/28840	Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered	115.2269287109375
21398/28840	Oh take ittake it said the count Haydée is almost as civilized as a Parisian the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume you	47.25916290283203
21399/28840	The cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for	86.6534194946289
21400/28840	Monte Cristo and Haydée took the beverage in the original Arabian manner that is to say without	48.27230453491211
21401/28840	Haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it	58.05419921875
21402/28840	At this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that	91.47582244873047
21403/28840	My dear host and you signora said Albert in Italian excuse my apparent	139.0195770263672
21404/28840	I am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be	16.655921936035156
21405/28840	Oh signora if I could but speak Greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to	68.2513656616211
21406/28840	I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you sir said Haydée quietly and if you like what is Eastern I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are	36.88296890258789
21407/28840	On what subject shall I converse with her said Albert in a low tone to Monte Crist	19.608177185058594
21408/28840	Just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of Rome Naples or	59.233070373535156
21409/28840	Oh said Albert it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian let me speak to her of the	65.95338439941406
21410/28840	Do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her	81.68817901611328
21411/28840	At what age did you leave Greece signora asked	112.1607437133789
21412/28840	I left it when I was but five years old replied Hayd	29.515647888183594
21413/28840	And have you any recollection of your country   When I shut my eyes and think I seem to see it all	38.694522857666016
21414/28840	The mind can see as well as the	74.72029113769531
21415/28840	The body forgets sometimes but the mind always	142.74168395996094
21416/28840	Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the	54.17442321777344
21417/28840	And how old were you at that time   I was three years old said Hayd	23.463083267211914
21418/28840	Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old said	66.83546447753906
21419/28840	Count said Albert in a low tone to Monte Cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her	35.37052536010742
21420/28840	You prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful	72.16181945800781
21421/28840	Haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful	65.13972473144531
21422/28840	What are you saying to her said Morcerf in an undert	17.54850959777832
21423/28840	I again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from	47.33892822265625
21424/28840	Then from time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either Kill or P	59.52757263183594
21425/28840	It is very strange said Albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self This is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe	72.27880859375
21426/28840	Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest	35.06317901611328
21427/28840	40068m       Speak speak signora said Albert I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you	29.40188980102539
21428/28840	Haydée answered his remark with a melancholy	137.46409606933594
21429/28840	You wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said	78.14051055908203
21430/28840	I beg you to do so replied	13.329666137695312
21431/28840	Well I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my	36.620697021484375
21432/28840	We were in the palace of Yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which I was sleeping and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with	37.79449462890625
21433/28840	When I saw her weeping I began to cry	142.1298828125
21434/28840	I saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest	58.34175491333008
21435/28840	Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a	74.23237609863281
21436/28840	Here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pinetorches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof	85.30017852783203
21437/28840	Quick said a voice at the end of the	22.231739044189453
21438/28840	This voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obe	127.31137084960938
21439/28840	As for me it made me trem	26.170446395874023
21440/28840	This voice was that of my	81.46610260009766
21441/28840	He came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented	81.78951263427734
21442/28840	He was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite Selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling	84.1644515991211
21443/28840	My father said Haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and before whom Turkey tremb	25.291641235351562
21444/28840	Soon said Haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a	34.8071174621582
21445/28840	My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces I saw my father who was glancing anxiously	32.94346618652344
21446/28840	Four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating on the	84.0027084350586
21447/28840	40070m       From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were	35.48614501953125
21448/28840	This kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discern	65.35340881347656
21449/28840	I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palik	42.110069274902344
21450/28840	14 Besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother Selim and	240.0175323486328
21451/28840	The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of	43.59905242919922
21452/28840	Why does the boat go so fast asked I of my	274.2155456542969
21453/28840	Silence child Hush we are flying I did not	384.80157470703125
21454/28840	Why should my father flyhe the allpowerfulhe before whom others were accustomed to flyhe who had taken for his device   They hate me then they fear me     It was indeed a flight which my father was trying to	77.07268524169922
21455/28840	I have been told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina fatigued with long service   Here Haydée cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her	17.314414978027344
21456/28840	The young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is	72.62227630615234
21457/28840	And this officer asked Albert do you remember his name signora   Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by	22.213603973388672
21458/28840	No said she I do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently I will tell	21.47635269165039
21459/28840	Albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was	24.90670394897461
21460/28840	It was towards this kiosk that we were ro	89.47015380859375
21461/28840	A ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the	47.93157958984375
21462/28840	But beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were	55.7674674987793
21463/28840	In this place were together 60000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 25000000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30000 pounds of gun	43.94208908081055
21464/28840	Near the barrels stood Selim my fathers favorite whom I mentioned to you just	172.69630432128906
21465/28840	He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everythingkiosk guards women gold and Ali Tepelini himselfat the first signal given by my	82.30559539794922
21466/28840	I remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and gro	100.20191192626953
21467/28840	As for me I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world I am quite sure I shall recognize Sel	42.52546310424805
21468/28840	I cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period I did not even know what time	28.72509002685547
21469/28840	Sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selims fiery l	50.90809631347656
21470/28840	One morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than	103.35673522949219

21472/28840	If my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to Yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this	117.75724792480469
21473/28840	But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my	39.961483001708984
21474/28840	Oh make yourself easy on that head said Ali smiling Selim and his flaming lance will settle that	141.51806640625
21475/28840	They would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with	32.68935012817383
21476/28840	My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fathers	90.17376708984375
21477/28840	Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with	50.168392181396484
21478/28840	Then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his	54.76559829711914
21479/28840	My mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she	68.82561492919922
21480/28840	A boattwothree murmured my fatherfour He then arose seizing his arms and priming his	76.91698455810547
21481/28840	Vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide	176.54559326171875
21482/28840	In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors	35.079586029052734
21483/28840	I will not quit you said Vasiliki if you die my lord I will die with	16.033689498901367
21484/28840	Adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of	102.24967193603516
21485/28840	Take away Vasiliki said my father to his Palik	47.8944091796875
21486/28840	As for me I had been forgotten in the general confusion I ran toward Ali Tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his	25.238262176513672
21487/28840	Oh how distinctly I remember that kissit was the last he ever gave me and I feel as if it were still warm on my	59.75345993041992
21488/28840	On descending we saw through the latticework several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our	112.81464385986328
21489/28840	At first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the	104.2231674194336
21490/28840	During this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty Palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the	59.92057800292969
21491/28840	They were armed with their long guns inlaid with motherofpearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the	24.734729766845703
21492/28840	My father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest	54.375244140625
21493/28840	This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last	94.60526275634766
21494/28840	My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the	41.65742111206055
21495/28840	Selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we	59.39966583251953
21496/28840	We fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by Sel	24.18733024597168
21497/28840	In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as I was I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our	94.27104187011719
21498/28840	Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and	15.631559371948242
21499/28840	Go on my child said the count in the Romaic	22.665115356445312
21500/28840	40074m       Haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristos voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her	22.605993270874023
21501/28840	It was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the	39.3930778503418
21502/28840	One single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was Selims flaming l	72.78781127929688
21503/28840	My mother was a Christian and she	205.22210693359375
21504/28840	Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words God is great However my mother had still some	187.92080688476562
21505/28840	As she was coming down she thought she recognized the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and	47.546363830566406
21506/28840	She advanced some steps towards the staircase and	80.97691345214844
21507/28840	They are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty   What do you fear Vasiliki said Selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so	42.21110153198242
21508/28840	If they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them	36.66206359863281
21509/28840	And he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of old Cre	81.73068237304688
21510/28840	16 But I being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited	84.64540100097656
21511/28840	My mother experienced the same sensations for I felt her trem	88.7000503540039
21512/28840	Mamma mamma said I are we really to be killed And at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lament	57.077545166015625
21513/28840	My child said Vasiliki may God preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread Then whispering to Selim she asked what were her masters	102.24523162841797
21514/28840	Suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of	105.4664077758789
21515/28840	The name of the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was	29.13854217529297
21516/28840	And do you not remember the Frenchmans name said Morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the	26.9239559173584
21517/28840	Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be	31.648317337036133

21520/28840	Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy	62.52250671386719

21524/28840	My mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bos	23.43891716003418

21526/28840	And she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to God in my behalf to raise me actually to his	58.61991500854492
21527/28840	And for the second time Haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and	45.87614059448242
21528/28840	40076m       Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of commandCour	27.10906982421875
21529/28840	Haydée dried her eyes and continued   By this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pashait was a	66.00507354736328

21531/28840	In whose name do you come said he to	63.03544998168945
21532/28840	I come in the name of our master Ali Tepel	24.546327590942383
21533/28840	If you come from Ali himself said Selim you know what you were charged to remit to meYes said the messenger and I bring you his	59.483055114746094
21534/28840	At these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable Selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his	53.54970932006836
21535/28840	I do not see what you have in your hand said Sel	18.465635299682617
21536/28840	Approach then said the messenger or I will come nearer to you if you prefer	105.10994720458984
21537/28840	I will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier place the object which I desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while I examine	64.11919403076172
21538/28840	Be it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by Sel	65.72489166259766
21539/28840	Oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed	58.029178619384766
21540/28840	But was it my fathers ring that was the	86.7767562866211
21541/28840	Selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the	41.90650177001953

21544/28840	At this signal four soldiers of the Seraskier Kourchid suddenly appeared and Selim fell pierced by five	103.9122314453125

21546/28840	At this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and	52.572391510009766
21547/28840	The lower rooms were entirely filled with Kourchids troops that is to say with our	77.89059448242188
21548/28840	Just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening	52.101829528808594
21549/28840	My mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards I luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing	79.31368255615234
21550/28840	What do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of	57.09877395629883
21551/28840	What we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his high	77.9224624633789

21555/28840	The Palikares who were prostrated at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and	58.35129928588867
21556/28840	At the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round	89.54624938964844
21557/28840	Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with	75.66490173339844
21558/28840	My father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks	120.22057342529297
21559/28840	But immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly dev	40.0672721862793
21560/28840	In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with	97.45702362060547
21561/28840	These two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful	42.05424118041992
21562/28840	However he remained standing clinging to a	41.08684158325195

21569/28840	Oh it is nothing said Monte Crist	15.501761436462402

21578/28840	Then said Albert you became the property of this man   40080m       No replied Haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slavemerchants who were going to	21.51991081237793

21583/28840	Oh you are good you are great my lord said Haydée kissing the counts hand and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master   Albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and	26.892423629760742

21587/28840	Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter   After all the disclosures which were made this morning	23.164382934570312
21588/28840	Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of	30.858613967895508
21589/28840	dÉpinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that	72.14286804199219
21590/28840	de Villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this	28.935291290283203
21591/28840	And in justice to Villefort it must be understood that	38.506229400634766
21592/28840	This harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of Ville	157.38272094726562
21593/28840	Hardly had he read the letter when his wife	78.211181640625
21594/28840	The sudden departure of Franz after being summoned by	140.51072692871094
21595/28840	Noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of Madame de Villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more	29.747711181640625
21596/28840	Determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden	55.9673957824707
21597/28840	de Villeforts communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between	37.25236511230469
21598/28840	dÉpinay and himself and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken	81.9276123046875
21599/28840	This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were	58.584625244140625
21600/28840	She therefore contented herself with saying that	160.61404418945312
21601/28840	Noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days	45.7669677734375
21602/28840	This news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a	52.846702575683594

21605/28840	In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentines	31.844593048095703

21608/28840	He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with	55.14888381958008

21610/28840	He was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the	32.557559967041016
21611/28840	The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with	52.92091369628906

21615/28840	Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry	32.586029052734375
21616/28840	During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed Madame de Villefort had gone to visit	29.67529296875
21617/28840	The old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive	25.705495834350586
21618/28840	Sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentines marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was	25.98432731628418
21619/28840	But one thing I can tell you of which I do not think you are aware that is that I have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approb	23.75473403930664
21620/28840	Noirtier regarded his daughterinlaw with the look of a man desiring an	32.94084167480469
21621/28840	Now that this marriage which I know you so much disliked is done away with I come to you on an errand which neither	95.42217254638672
21622/28840	de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently	87.18537902832031
21623/28840	Noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her	104.95388793945312
21624/28840	There was a doubtful expression in Noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing	35.74774169921875
21625/28840	May I hope sir said Madame de Villefort that your intentions accord with my request   Noirtier made a sign that they	18.10918426513672

21627/28840	Noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine on condition that she should never be separated from	39.39863967895508
21628/28840	While all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriagecontract were being carried on at the house of	26.165287017822266
21629/28840	de Villefort Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to	12.889772415161133
21630/28840	Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best	35.30365753173828
21631/28840	At the first sight of his old friend Danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy	27.463356018066406

21633/28840	Morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and	41.17398452758789
21634/28840	To what do you allude monsieur said Danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generals	23.381912231445312
21635/28840	Ah said Morcerf I see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be	27.699893951416016
21636/28840	_Ma foi_ I beg your pardon but as I have but one son and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him I am still serving my apprenticeship you know come I will	26.351442337036133
21637/28840	And Morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to	24.204896926879883
21638/28840	Danglars said   Baron I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son the Vicomte Albert de Morcer	8.791025161743164
21639/28840	I do not understand you baron said Morcer	8.266119956970215
21640/28840	de Monte Cristo have you not   I see him very often said Danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of	21.467666625976562
21641/28840	Well in one of your late conversations with him you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not   I did say	50.91242218017578
21642/28840	Well here I am proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that	34.25539779663086
21643/28840	Danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just	23.258886337280273
21644/28840	I am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the	34.68630599975586
21645/28840	What do you mean to say   I mean to say that I have a good reason but that it is difficult to	13.217860221862793
21646/28840	You must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my	41.76899719238281
21647/28840	No sir said Danglars I merely suspend my decision that is	24.54737091064453
21648/28840	A cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned	135.70945739746094
21649/28840	My dear Danglars said Morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others	21.79554557800293
21650/28840	You owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your	48.09434509277344
21651/28840	It is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all I can say sir replied Danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed	27.58307456970215
21652/28840	And towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said Morcerf turning pale with	34.888671875
21653/28840	The expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said   You may perhaps be better satisfied that I should not go farther into	34.100990295410156
21654/28840	A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said I have a right to insist on your giving me an	33.14997100830078
21655/28840	No do not seek any longer to discover the	60.49066162109375
21656/28840	I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe selfexamination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an	61.39012908935547
21657/28840	My daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty	100.67609405517578
21658/28840	Calumnies did you say sir cried Morcerf turning livid with	56.413692474365234
21659/28840	Does anyone dare to slander me   Monsieur I told you that I considered it best to avoid all	58.93083572387695
21660/28840	Enough sir said Morcerf we will speak no more on the	21.732027053833008

21665/28840	The next morning as soon as he awoke Danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on _lImpartial_ the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief	25.276601791381836
21666/28840	He hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed   _We hear from Yan	111.40583038330078
21667/28840	_     Very good observed Danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little article on Colonel Fernand which if I am not mistaken would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly	31.2259464263916
21668/28840	When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour	19.675392150878906
21669/28840	Did he take Baptistin with him   No my	36.03459930419922
21670/28840	Call him then I wish to speak to	23.566884994506836
21671/28840	The concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an	15.32831859588623
21672/28840	My good friend said Albert I beg pardon for my intrusion but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or	48.09246826171875
21673/28840	He is really out sir replied Baptist	74.27185821533203
21674/28840	Out even to me   I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said Baptistin and I should therefore never think of including him in any general	55.50718307495117
21675/28840	You are right and now I wish to see him on an affair of great	33.61611557006836
21676/28840	Do you think it will be long before he comes in   No I think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten o	28.828174591064453
21677/28840	Albert left the cab in which he had come at the counts door intending to take a turn on	37.4523811340332
21678/28840	As he was passing the Allée des Veuves he thought he saw the counts horses standing at Gossets shootinggallery he approached and soon recognized the coach	56.131710052490234
21679/28840	Is the count shooting in the gallery said Morcer	54.79109191894531
21680/28840	While he was speaking Albert had heard the report of two or three pistol	43.00558090209961
21681/28840	He entered and on his way met the	93.64425659179688
21682/28840	Excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment   What for Philip asked Albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his	69.10480499267578
21683/28840	Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of	37.67561721801758
21684/28840	Not even before you Philip Then who loads his pistol   His	142.00462341308594

21686/28840	Oh that is quite another thing	43.22904968261719
21687/28840	I will go immediately and inform him of your	21.298322677612305
21688/28840	And Philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards Monte Cristo appeared on the	61.991336822509766
21689/28840	I ask your pardon my dear count said Albert for following you here and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so I alone am to blame for the indisc	23.533700942993164
21690/28840	I went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to	36.4775276184082
21691/28840	I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten oclock when I caught sight of your carriage and	36.90414047241211
21692/28840	What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with	44.68770217895508
21693/28840	40092m       No thank you I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse	81.243896484375
21694/28840	What on earth are you talking of   I am to fight	46.85592269897461
21695/28840	For what   For the sake of fighting   Yes I understand that but what is the quarrel People fight for all sorts of reasons you	36.897396087646484
21696/28840	I fight in the cause of	120.99327087402344
21697/28840	So serious that I come to beg you to render me a	60.55683517456055
21698/28840	What is it   To be my	39.506839752197266
21699/28840	That is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get	46.578399658203125
21700/28840	The count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after	73.17569732666016
21701/28840	Come in my lord said Philip in a low tone and I will show you something d	24.77107810974121
21702/28840	Morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed against the	44.86574172973633
21703/28840	At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the	130.88002014160156
21704/28840	Ah ha said Albert I see you were preparing for a game of	73.67510986328125
21705/28840	No said the count I was making a	28.56566047668457
21706/28840	Those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and	291.948974609375
21707/28840	In fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with	129.6057586669922
21708/28840	In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts	33.147396087646484
21709/28840	What would you have my dear viscount said Monte Cristo wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or	30.094335556030273
21710/28840	But come I am waiting for	33.108970642089844
21711/28840	Both men entered Monte Cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at	50.21668243408203
21712/28840	Monte Cristo took Albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for	50.4350700378418
21713/28840	Now let us talk the matter over quietly said the	49.958106994628906
21714/28840	You see I am perfectly composed said	125.03977966308594
21715/28840	With whom are you going to fight   With Beauch	22.983379364013672
21716/28840	One of your friends   Of course it is always with friends that one	51.248226165771484
21717/28840	I suppose you have some cause of quarrel   I	20.66851806640625
21718/28840	40094m       What has he done to you   There appeared in his journal last nightbut wait and read for	40.66362380981445
21719/28840	And Albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows   A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in	52.8968620300293
21720/28840	The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand in whom the grand vizier Ali Tepelini had reposed the greatest	26.275644302368164
21721/28840	Oh my dear viscount do talk reason   I do not desire to do	37.904335021972656
21722/28840	They have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high	44.389198303222656
21723/28840	I inherit my fathers name and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken	67.52318572998047
21724/28840	I am going to Beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two	53.71138381958008
21725/28840	No you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same	67.90282440185547
21726/28840	I will efface that blot on my fathers	86.97137451171875
21727/28840	My father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant   Oh well he will add We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf who also bears the same Christian	45.07585906982422
21728/28840	I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retract	47.11762237548828
21729/28840	And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you  	42.625343322753906
21730/28840	Which means I suppose that you refuse the service which I asked of you   You know my theory regarding duels I told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at	52.73108673095703
21731/28840	Nevertheless my dear count I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to	76.5596694946289
21732/28840	Because my dear fellow you understand one must never be	77.55726623535156
21733/28840	If ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study	241.72140502929688
21734/28840	You admit that you would fight then Well if so why do you object to my doing so   I do not say that you ought not to fight I only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due	38.96063232421875
21735/28840	Did he reflect before he insulted my father   If he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be	60.46251678466797
21736/28840	Ah my dear count you are far too indul	36.605499267578125
21737/28840	Supposing for instance and do not be angry at what I am going to say  	32.31980895996094
21738/28840	Supposing the assertion to be really true   A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers	68.79683685302734
21739/28840	_Ma foi_ we live in times when there is much to which we must	81.89922332763672
21740/28840	That is precisely the fault of the	86.25662994384766
21741/28840	And do you undertake to reform it   Yes as far as I am personally	29.403017044067383
21742/28840	Well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow   Yes I own	30.118633270263672
21743/28840	Are you quite impervious to good advice   Not when it comes from a	52.94215393066406
21744/28840	And do you account me that title   Certainly I	35.09430694580078
21745/28840	Well then before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the	53.52305603027344
21746/28840	You reject this means of information then   I domost	211.27737426757812
21747/28840	Then let me offer one more word of	262.39422607421875
21748/28840	Do so then but let it be the	83.84292602539062
21749/28840	You do not wish to hear it perhaps   On the contrary I request	24.29583740234375
21750/28840	Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchampvisit him	48.34608840942383
21751/28840	That would be contrary to all	310.044921875
21752/28840	Your case is not an ordinary	396.234619140625
21753/28840	And what is your reason for advising me to go alone   Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauch	28.818923950195312
21754/28840	If Beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free willthe satisfaction to you will be the	46.29032516479492
21755/28840	If on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your	72.05268859863281
21756/28840	They will not be strangers they will be	65.42671203613281
21757/28840	Ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow Beauchamp for	99.57841491699219
21758/28840	So you recommend   I recommend you to be	74.7243881225586
21759/28840	Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp   I do and I will tell you	17.755945205688477
21760/28840	When you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound	76.26875305175781
21761/28840	Go but you would do better still by not going at	120.14715576171875
21762/28840	Do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you	96.6610336303711
21763/28840	Why   Perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my	37.65056228637695
21764/28840	Well I will have Franz and ChâteauRenaud they will be the very men for	26.768157958984375
21765/28840	But if I do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing   That too is	85.46979522705078
21766/28840	What a singular being you areyou will not interfere in	160.9342803955078
21767/28840	You are rightthat is the principle on which I wish to	50.465538024902344
21768/28840	We will say no more about it	28.59564971923828
21769/28840	Morcerf took his hat and left the	15.19034481048584
21770/28840	He found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp who was in his	46.26441192626953
21771/28840	It was a gloomy dustylooking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immem	98.53192901611328
21772/28840	Beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be	28.819011688232422
21773/28840	Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the	47.20782470703125
21774/28840	This way this way my dear Albert said he holding out his hand to the young	19.726612091064453
21775/28840	Beauchamp said Albert it is of your journal that I come to	53.95058822631836
21776/28840	Indeed What do you wish to say about it   I desire that a statement contained in it should be rect	29.476821899414062
21777/28840	To what do you refer But pray sit	87.30244445800781
21778/28840	Thank you said Albert with a cold and formal	95.66472625732422
21779/28840	Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you   An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my	33.07878875732422
21780/28840	What is it said Beauchamp much surprised surely you must be	42.196922302246094
21781/28840	Yanina   Yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me	48.643348693847656
21782/28840	Such is really the case I assure you upon my honor Baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried Beauch	52.042808532714844
21783/28840	Here I have brought mine with me replied	75.39015197753906
21784/28840	Beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undert	43.85950469970703
21785/28840	You see it is a serious annoyance said Morcerf when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the	25.914365768432617
21786/28840	Is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the	93.2035903930664
21787/28840	Well what do you wish me to do for you said Beauchamp	11.31247329711914
21788/28840	My dear Beauchamp I wish you to contradict this	38.055965423583984
21789/28840	Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent	28.185026168823242
21790/28840	Come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you	49.10176086425781
21791/28840	Sit down and I will read it	69.40006256103516
21792/28840	Albert resumed his seat and Beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his	58.988162994384766
21793/28840	Well said Albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and I insist on a retractation being	36.1983757019043
21794/28840	You insist   Yes I	123.75291442871094
21795/28840	Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber my dear vis	21.833642959594727
21796/28840	Nor do I wish to be there replied the young man	25.723569869995117
21797/28840	I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday	34.71796417236328
21798/28840	You have known me long enough continued Albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that Beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this	38.369781494140625
21799/28840	If I have been your friend Morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that	57.17413330078125
21800/28840	But wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not	67.20565795898438
21801/28840	You are irritated and vexedtell me how this Fernand is related to you   He is merely my father said Albert	44.043128967285156
21802/28840	Fernand Mondego Count of Morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of	53.45146560668945
21803/28840	Is it your father said Beauchamp that is quite another	30.49123191833496
21804/28840	Then I can well understand your indignation my dear	70.72557067871094
21805/28840	I will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he	42.54783248901367
21806/28840	But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your	95.33612823486328
21807/28840	40100m       No but the connection will be seen by others and therefore I will have the article	26.016765594482422
21808/28840	At the words _I will_ Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Alberts countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few	34.90045928955078
21809/28840	You will retract this assertion will you not Beauchamp said Albert with increased though stifled	63.113555908203125
21810/28840	When I am convinced that the statement is	35.59722137451172
21811/28840	What   The thing is worth looking into and I will take pains to investigate the matter	70.30686950683594
21812/28840	But what is there to investigate sir said Albert enraged beyond measure at Beauchamps last	125.945556640625
21813/28840	If you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing	65.51862335205078
21814/28840	Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his	30.258811950683594
21815/28840	Sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half	37.999755859375

21831/28840	When he had concluded his speech Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert turned his back upon him and went to the press	29.9365177154541
21832/28840	He was passing the Chinese Baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte SaintMartin and to be going towards the Madele	21.513256072998047
21833/28840	Ah said Morcerf there goes a happy man And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his	89.21117401123047
21834/28840	The Lemonade   Morrel was in fact very	46.089473724365234
21835/28840	Noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab	30.21088218688965
21836/28840	He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg SaintHonor	13.934367179870605
21837/28840	Morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor Barrois followed him as he best	73.29576110839844
21838/28840	Morrel was only thirtyone Barrois was sixty years of age Morrel was deeply in love and Barrois was dying with heat and exert	31.250545501708984
21839/28840	These two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of	199.67193603515625
21840/28840	On arriving at the house Morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but Barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to	45.642757415771484
21841/28840	The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of	50.87508010864258
21842/28840	She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her	49.750526428222656
21843/28840	But the easychair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the	34.463951110839844
21844/28840	Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from	52.656063079833984
21845/28840	Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on	60.45271682739258
21846/28840	Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to	35.599327087402344
21847/28840	Am I to say what you told me asked	59.34661102294922
21848/28840	Noirtier made a sign that she was to do	12.785993576049805
21849/28840	Monsieur Morrel said Valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather	16.169601440429688
21850/28840	Noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that I may repeat them to	27.858774185180664
21851/28840	I will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter I will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his	42.76725769042969
21852/28840	Oh I am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak I beg of	17.377504348754883
21853/28840	Valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for Morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming	55.80720901489258
21854/28840	My grandfather intends leaving this house said she and Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in	148.55612182617188

21860/28840	And with my grandfathers consent I shall fulfil the promise which I have made	26.807884216308594
21861/28840	Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but Morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear	30.783824920654297
21862/28840	Have I not explained your wishes grandpapa said Valentine addressing Noirt	35.91436004638672
21863/28840	Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case I shall expect	70.84593200683594
21864/28840	Morrel to come and claim me at my own	100.2838363647461
21865/28840	And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said Morrel not only with resignation but with cheer	69.73220825195312
21866/28840	How hot you look my good Barrois said	107.4256820678711
21867/28840	Ah I have been running very fast mademoiselle but I must do	39.21322250366211
21868/28840	Morrel the justice to say that he ran still	132.1042938232422
21869/28840	Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a	36.34404754638672
21870/28840	The decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by	48.155250549316406
21871/28840	Come Barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade I see you are coveting a good draught of	28.8516902923584
21872/28840	The fact is mademoiselle said Barrois I am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me I cannot say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of	38.160396575927734
21873/28840	Take some then and come back	287.8657531738281
21874/28840	Barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had	88.9775161743164
21875/28840	Valentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the door	27.13704490661621
21876/28840	It was the signal of a	52.66714859008789

21886/28840	What is the matter Barrois said	25.200651168823242
21887/28840	The old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand	41.435855865478516
21888/28840	He is going to fall cried Mor	55.91682052612305
21889/28840	The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous	49.27499771118164
21890/28840	Noirtier seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of	61.00033950805664
21891/28840	Barrois made some steps towards his	76.94717407226562
21892/28840	Ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with	11.714089393615723

21894/28840	By this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiff	28.946876525878906
21895/28840	Valentine uttered a cry of horror Morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown	34.432430267333984

21899/28840	Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a	76.35615539550781
21900/28840	Pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized suff	62.716026306152344
21901/28840	Noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a	63.63950729370117
21902/28840	One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless	64.24712371826172
21903/28840	Barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than	37.32307434082031

21905/28840	Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a	20.18708038330078

21909/28840	Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying	45.973270416259766
21910/28840	She turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the	100.60939025878906

21927/28840	The young man pressed Valentines hand to his lips and then left the house by a back	20.59956169128418

22127/28840	I must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable	56.90834426879883
22128/28840	Besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to	39.245704650878906

22274/28840	How can I On what plea   You are right but you have made my mouth	66.39545440673828
22275/28840	I must absolutely see it I shall find a	88.67066192626953
22276/28840	No nonsense Caderousse   I will offer myself as floorpol	39.336158752441406
22277/28840	Well then I must be contented to imagine	51.742034912109375
22278/28840	That is the best plan believe	143.73458862304688
22279/28840	Try at least to give me an idea of what it	19.12961196899414
22280/28840	How can I   Nothing is	78.9894027709961
22281/28840	How is it arranged   Faith I should require pen ink and paper to make a	51.71681213378906
22282/28840	They are all here said Caderousse brisk	22.46520233154297
22283/28840	He fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and	57.80388259887695
22284/28840	Here said Caderousse draw me all that on the paper my	70.27584075927734
22285/28840	Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and	66.86676788330078
22286/28840	The house as I said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see Andrea drew the garden the court and the	57.7851448059082
22287/28840	40142m       High walls   Not more than eight or ten	32.52149963378906
22288/28840	In the court are orangetrees in pots turf and clumps of	62.77397918701172
22289/28840	The stables   Are on either side of the gate which you see	43.468299865722656
22290/28840	Let us see the ground floor said Cader	51.521240234375
22291/28840	On the ground floor diningroom two drawingrooms billiardroom staircase in the hall and a little back	53.20207977294922
22292/28840	Windows   Magnificent windows so beautiful so large that I believe a man of your size should pass through each	97.80095672607422
22293/28840	Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows   Luxury has	127.93782806396484
22294/28840	But shutters   Yes but they are never	51.91352081298828
22295/28840	That Count of Monte Cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at	48.26337432861328
22296/28840	And where do the servants sleep   Oh they have a house to	63.122013092041016
22297/28840	Picture to yourself a pretty coachhouse at the righthand side where the ladders are	75.39705657958984
22298/28840	Well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different	107.75911712646484
22299/28840	I was saying to him only yesterday You are imprudent Monsieur Count for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left	33.97707748413086
22300/28840	Well said he what next Well next some day you will be	157.49037170410156
22301/28840	What did he answer   He quietly said What do I care if I am   Andrea he has some secretaire with a	59.22725296020508
22302/28840	How do you know   Yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a	54.63043975830078
22303/28840	I was told there were such at the last	76.64517211914062
22304/28840	He has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always	53.91264343261719
22305/28840	And he is not robbed   No his servants are all devoted to	43.074642181396484
22306/28840	There ought to be some money in that secretaire   There may	35.68488693237305
22307/28840	And where is it   On the first	15.442924499511719
22308/28840	Sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my	170.57205200195312
22309/28840	On the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawingroom to the right of the drawingroom a library and a study to the left a bedroom and a dressing	30.233205795288086
22310/28840	The famous secretaire is in the dressing	41.776634216308594
22311/28840	Is there a window in the dressingroom   Twoone here and one	65.55400085449219
22312/28840	Andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the	95.81436920166016
22313/28840	Does he often go to Auteuil added	27.78104019165039
22314/28840	Tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night	39.57459259033203
22315/28840	Are you sure of it   He has invited me to dine	14.868001937866211
22316/28840	Theres a life for you said Caderousse a town house and a country	59.637351989746094
22317/28840	That is what it is to be	62.20506286621094
22318/28840	And shall you dine there  	46.20246124267578
22319/28840	When you dine there do you sleep there   If I like I am at home	39.55994415283203
22320/28840	Caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his	17.6290283203125
22321/28840	But Andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a Havana quietly lit it and began	60.34621047973633
22322/28840	When do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to Cader	21.62828254699707
22323/28840	Andrea took fiveandtwenty louis from his	43.27833938598633
22324/28840	Yellow boys said Caderousse no I thank	28.914899826049805
22325/28840	On the contrary I esteem them but will not have	54.595611572265625
22326/28840	You can change them idiot gold is worth five s	226.587890625
22327/28840	Exactly and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in	119.413330078125
22328/28840	No nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on	160.10922241210938
22329/28840	But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me I should want a p	56.24745559692383
22330/28840	Well leave them with your porter he is to be	77.77798461914062
22331/28840	Today   No tomorrow I shall not have time	39.495574951171875
22332/28840	Well tomorrow I will leave them when I go to Auteu	21.20529556274414
22333/28840	May I depend on it  	47.33609390258789
22334/28840	Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of	84.42962646484375
22335/28840	Now see here will that be all Eh And will you not torment me any more  	72.62525177001953
22336/28840	Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the	52.20441436767578
22337/28840	How sprightly you are said Caderousse One would say you were already in possession of your	44.112056732177734
22338/28840	No unfortunately but when I do obtain it   Well   I shall remember old friends I can tell you	42.16398239135742
22339/28840	Yes since you have such a good	35.1424674987793
22340/28840	What do you want It looks as if you were trying to fleece me   I What an idea I who am going to give you another piece of good	34.09809875488281
22341/28840	What is it   To leave behind you the diamond you have on your	57.11650466918945
22342/28840	You will ruin both yourself and me by your	155.31724548339844
22343/28840	How You put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand franc	66.75010681152344
22344/28840	I know something of diamonds I have had	68.2308349609375
22345/28840	You do well to boast of it said Andrea who without becoming angry as Caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the	95.10660552978516
22346/28840	Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were	42.48868179321289
22347/28840	It is a false diamond said Cader	23.280691146850586
22348/28840	Do not be angry we can try	204.13584899902344
22349/28840	Caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would	59.80277633666992
22350/28840	_Confiteor_ said Caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger I was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers shopit is another branch of industry	49.56882095336914
22351/28840	Have you finished said Andreado you want anything morewill you have my waistcoat or my hat Make free now you have	156.14187622070312
22352/28840	No you are after all a good companion I will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my	41.63694763183594
22353/28840	But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the	67.04421997070312
22354/28840	I shall not sell itdo not	89.0959701538086
22355/28840	Not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young	33.97374725341797
22356/28840	Happy rogue said Caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed   Yes said	20.719757080078125
22357/28840	Well I hope you will make a handsome weddingpresent the day you marry Mademoiselle Dangl	13.703731536865234
22358/28840	I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your	20.988798141479492
22359/28840	What fortune has she   But I tell you   A million   Andrea shrugged his	20.55360221862793
22360/28840	Let it be a million said Caderousse you can never have so much as I wish	30.518129348754883
22361/28840	Oh I wish it you with all my heart added Caderousse with his hoarse	22.864534378051758
22362/28840	Stop let me show you the	31.865205764770508
22363/28840	Why   Because there is a little secret a precaution I thought it desirable to take one of Huret  Fichets locks revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a	67.99793243408203
22364/28840	Thank you said Andrea I will let you know a week	86.41854858398438
22365/28840	Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories but also cross the	96.15705108642578
22366/28840	Then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan Andrea had left	54.29592514038086
22367/28840	Dear Benedetto said he I think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst	42.89289093017578
22368/28840	He was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to Andrea either by the arrival of Bertuccio from Normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sl	62.56071472167969
22369/28840	The house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to	57.775691986083984
22370/28840	The count praised Bertuccios zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a	55.85097122192383
22371/28840	Now said he I may require to go in one night from Paris to Tréport let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten	46.063140869140625
22372/28840	Your highness had already expressed that wish said Bertuccio and the horses are	139.86599731445312
22373/28840	I have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally	56.11102294921875
22374/28840	Thats well said Monte Cristo I remain here a day or twoarrange	48.438873291015625
22375/28840	As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders Baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver	40.99222946166992
22376/28840	What are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust I did not send for you I think   Baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the	32.04605484008789
22377/28840	The count opened the letter and read  	33.67416763305664
22378/28840	de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the ChampsÉlysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing	20.1884765625
22379/28840	The counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this	139.85098266601562
22380/28840	The count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressingroom would be able to defend his property	52.36934280395508
22381/28840	Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and	403.77252197265625
22382/28840	de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be	55.410972595214844
22383/28840	The counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a	62.8317756652832
22384/28840	We know the counts vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great	115.14833068847656
22385/28840	From his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against God and sometimes against the world that is against the	54.981727600097656
22386/28840	They do not want my papers said Monte Cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but	49.87489700317383
22387/28840	I will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private	23.7471981048584
22388/28840	I am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this	53.65080642700195
22389/28840	The count recalled Baptistin who had left the room after delivering the	43.98318862915039
22390/28840	Return to Paris said he assemble the servants who remain	111.15834045410156
22391/28840	I want all my household at Auteu	25.774677276611328
22392/28840	But will no one remain in the house my lord asked Baptist	56.9528923034668
22393/28840	My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the	63.972450256347656
22394/28840	Well   The house might be stripped without his hearing the least	53.094688415527344
22395/28840	Thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disob	278.02587890625
22396/28840	40150m       You understand me said the	13.792152404785156
22397/28840	Bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground	111.53541564941406
22398/28840	And those of the first floor   You know they are never	45.25080871582031
22399/28840	Go   The count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but Ali should attend	55.37471008300781
22400/28840	All was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as Baptistin had	37.52527618408203
22401/28840	Monte Cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passersby and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was	41.74393081665039
22402/28840	Ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching	25.103910446166992
22403/28840	Arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to Ali to stop then he passed into the dressingroom which he	41.157169342041016
22404/28840	Everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secret	61.29719543457031
22405/28840	He double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went	67.32135009765625
22406/28840	Meanwhile Ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a singlebarrelled	43.227874755859375
22407/28840	Thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his	105.21395111083984
22408/28840	The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining	32.006797790527344
22409/28840	He had within his reach his pistols and carbine and Ali standing near him held one of the small Arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the Crus	97.52982330322266
22410/28840	Through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressingroom the count could see into the	35.185054779052734
22411/28840	It was intensely dark still Ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the	89.23836517333984
22412/28840	The little light in the lodge had long been	185.0828857421875
22413/28840	It might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in Monte Cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his	89.65550231933594
22414/28840	It would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing	61.12848663330078
22415/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three	123.39546966552734
22416/28840	A firm and wellpractised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a	119.99646759033203
22417/28840	The count felt his heart beat more	120.31588745117188
22418/28840	Inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the	78.14624786376953
22419/28840	However Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his	42.3242073059082
22420/28840	Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his	120.21885681152344
22421/28840	The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing	52.81251907348633
22422/28840	He fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without	52.02829360961914
22423/28840	Through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man	93.19078826904297
22424/28840	Thats a daring rascal whispered the	245.35475158691406
22425/28840	At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the	194.598388671875
22426/28840	He turned Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the	36.79155349731445
22427/28840	I see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands	55.764381408691406
22428/28840	He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing	20.757556915283203
22429/28840	The glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before	52.85789108276367
22430/28840	At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his	90.23954010009766
22431/28840	There were two doors he bolted them	231.05506896972656
22432/28840	When he drew near to the bedroom door Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper	25.412809371948242
22433/28840	The nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full	79.57943725585938
22434/28840	Alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was	56.47385025024414
22435/28840	But the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all	46.90208053588867
22436/28840	The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the	75.55674743652344
22437/28840	Ah ha whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a	40.22970199584961
22438/28840	But the man in the dark could not find the right	119.22722625732422
22439/28840	He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and count	99.71331787109375

22442/28840	40154m       Then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegr	33.98857879638672
22443/28840	It was an order the count had just given for immediately Ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a threecornered	49.53095626831055
22444/28840	who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hat	93.5225601196289
22445/28840	The tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb	49.62833786010742
22446/28840	The man hearing nothing more stood erect and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nighting	74.77749633789062
22447/28840	Try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might betry again you have a few minutes work	97.90160369873047
22448/28840	Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to Ali he whispered   Remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if I call	56.61443328857422
22449/28840	Ali bowed in token of strict	79.16338348388672
22450/28840	Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his	60.04780197143555
22451/28840	The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly	74.01532745361328
22452/28840	The count placed himself between Caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of	100.0306167602539

22454/28840	Yes undoubtedly the Abbé Busoni himself replied Monte Crist	15.91903305053711

22492/28840	True said Caderousse Benedetto has become the son of a great	18.226179122924805
22493/28840	How can he be the son of a great lord   A natural	42.69476318359375

22500/28840	You are right it is not you who should apprise	50.037899017333984
22501/28840	Why not   Because you would bring us to	70.09000396728516
22502/28840	And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes   Reverend sir said Caderousse drawing still	59.81931686401367

22504/28840	At the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassins wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and Caderousse uttered a cry of	25.53688621520996

22524/28840	Caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the	60.309791564941406
22525/28840	Now go down said the abbé folding his	25.626907348632812
22526/28840	Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him Caderousse began to go	34.406368255615234
22527/28840	Then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the ChampsÉlysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a	17.033369064331055
22528/28840	What are you doing reverend sir Suppose a watchman should pass And he blew out the	90.82352447509766
22529/28840	He then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his	57.90073776245117
22530/28840	Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first Caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came	34.542057037353516
22531/28840	The count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come	39.775062561035156
22532/28840	Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was	63.26384735107422
22533/28840	No one could be seen or	63.942562103271484
22534/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck	95.3767318725586
22535/28840	Then Caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the	48.707115173339844
22536/28840	But once started he could not	192.1362762451172

22538/28840	This time Caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three	31.885263442993164
22539/28840	The assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was	60.379947662353516

22731/28840	And what does Mademoiselle dArmilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil   Oh well I dont know but I understand that she is going to	18.227460861206055
22732/28840	Madame Danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the _impresari_ I gave her a few lines for the director of the Valle Theatre who is under some obligation to	39.84310531616211
22733/28840	But what is the matter Albert you look dull are you after all unconsciously in love with Mademoiselle Eugénie   I am not aware of it said Albert smiling sorrow	21.054637908935547
22734/28840	Beauchamp turned to look at some	118.52711486816406
22735/28840	But continued Monte Cristo you are not in your usual spirits   I have a dreadful headache said	23.621662139892578
22736/28840	Well my dear viscount said Monte Cristo I have an infallible remedy to propose to	8.517541885375977

22739/28840	Shall we go together   You annoyed count said Beauchamp and by what   Ah you think very lightly of it I should like to see you with a brief preparing in your	34.484962463378906

22744/28840	de Villefort heard of him at Marseilles and	53.37531280517578
22745/28840	I am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me vis	32.298648834228516
22746/28840	Then it is settled   Yes but where   I have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his	71.64765930175781
22747/28840	I love that humiliation I who am master of the universe as was	127.6808853149414
22748/28840	But where are you really going   To sea viscount you know I am a	28.093820571899414
22749/28840	You accept my proposal   I	69.4038314819336
22750/28840	Well viscount there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka with four posthorses in which one may rest as in a	71.54742431640625
22751/28840	Beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us   Thank you I have just returned from	133.961181640625
22752/28840	What you have been to sea   Yes I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands	14.565634727478027
22753/28840	What of that come with us said	130.1217041015625
22754/28840	No dear Morcerf you know I only refuse when the thing is	40.202816009521484
22755/28840	Besides it is important added he in a low tone that I should remain in Paris just now to watch the	31.56560516357422
22756/28840	Ah you are a good and an excellent friend said Albert yes you are right watch watch Beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this	39.72663497924805
22757/28840	Albert and Beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a	80.76112365722656
22758/28840	Beauchamp is a worthy fellow said Monte Cristo when the journalist was gone is he not Albert   Yes and a sincere friend I love him devoted	43.97626876831055
22759/28840	But now we are alonealthough it is immaterial to mewhere are we going   Into Normandy if you	39.14076614379883

22761/28840	Exactly what I wish for I will apprise my mother of my intention and return to	41.61008071899414
22762/28840	But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy   I may go where I	40.653289794921875
22763/28840	Yes I am aware you may go alone since I once met you in Italybut to accompany the mysterious Monte Cristo   You forget count that I have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in	43.3707160949707
22764/28840	woman is like a wave of the sea said Shakespeare both the great king and the great poet ought to have known womans nature	63.60655975341797
22765/28840	Womans yes my mother is not woman but _a_	131.96080017089844
22766/28840	As I am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if I do not understand all the subtle refinements of your	27.3043212890625
22767/28840	What I mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never	31.460710525512695
22768/28840	And does she try to make you dislike me   On the contrary she often says Morcerf I believe the count has a noble nature try to gain his	41.29648208618164
22769/28840	You see then said Albert that instead of opposing she will encourage	111.65775299072266
22770/28840	Adieu then until five oclock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or	71.01569366455078
22771/28840	At Tréport   Yes or in the	40.79121780395508
22772/28840	But can we travel fortyeight leagues in eight hours   Easily said Monte Crist	40.24728775024414
22773/28840	You are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in France but even the te	51.11196517944336
22774/28840	But viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me	57.461849212646484
22775/28840	Do not fear I have little to	199.90924072265625
22776/28840	Monte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep	85.54926300048828
22777/28840	But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio	17.315309524536133
22778/28840	Bertuccio said he I intend going this evening to Normandy instead of tomorrow or the next	59.31631088256836
22779/28840	You will have sufficient time before five oclock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first	48.926788330078125
22780/28840	Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six o	30.613330841064453
22781/28840	From Pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were	71.78194427490234
22782/28840	Before his departure the count went to Haydées apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her	59.801177978515625
22783/28840	The journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which Morcerf had formed no previous	72.42090606689453
22784/28840	The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling	79.97132110595703
22785/28840	Ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the	111.39408874511719
22786/28840	This child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the	69.70361328125
22787/28840	The thirtytwo that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the	103.64031219482422
22788/28840	That is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses   You see I travel with	37.82383728027344
22789/28840	When I no longer require them Bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the	42.8397331237793
22790/28840	But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase	82.07701873779297
22791/28840	Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his	53.72108840942383
22792/28840	Count may I suggest one idea to you  	76.60918426513672
22793/28840	It is that next to you Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in	83.94416809082031
22794/28840	You are mistaken viscount I believe he has not a franc in his	60.169586181640625
22795/28840	My dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things I warn you I shall not believe	41.70060729980469
22796/28840	I countenance nothing that is marvellous	76.27791595458984
22797/28840	Tell me why does a steward rob his master   Because I suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of	48.78586959838867
22798/28840	You are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and	67.8060531616211
22799/28840	Also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the	51.85443878173828
22800/28840	Bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my	99.75959014892578
22801/28840	Why   Because I should never get a	24.404783248901367
22802/28840	But I deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and	95.2574691772461
22803/28840	Do you possess that right over Bertuccio  	46.68463134765625
22804/28840	There are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts	343.2581787109375
22805/28840	The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirtytwo horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight	89.43760681152344
22806/28840	At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful	71.1319351196289
22807/28840	The porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts	36.123233795166016
22808/28840	At half past two in the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were	59.85980224609375
22809/28840	The servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him Baptistin who rode in front attended the	37.44758224487305
22810/28840	Albert bathed took his supper and went to	53.23360824584961
22811/28840	All night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the	63.17118835449219
22812/28840	On rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small	85.91023254394531
22813/28840	Around the schooner lay a number of small fishingboats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their	79.9906997680664
22814/28840	There as in every spot where Monte Cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost	113.9675064086914
22815/28840	Albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the Englisheminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for	81.18882751464844
22816/28840	The day passed in pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo exce	53.934688568115234
22817/28840	They killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summerhouse overlooking the ocean and took tea in the	63.87399673461914
22818/28840	Towards the evening of the third	241.86448669433594
22819/28840	He was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience Monte Crist	24.0620174407959
22820/28840	40188m       Florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill And he hastened to the	28.212814331054688
22821/28840	Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a	35.007198333740234
22822/28840	From whom is this said he	182.94500732421875
22823/28840	Did he send you   Yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till I had reached you I have come in fifteen	44.70947265625
22824/28840	Albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the	102.24956512451172
22825/28840	His sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported	57.84333801269531
22826/28840	Poor young man said Monte Cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth	29.972633361816406
22827/28840	Meanwhile Albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying   Florentin is your horse fit to return immediately   It is a poor lame post	41.55994415283203
22828/28840	In what state was the house when you left   All was quiet but on returning from	62.60633850097656
22829/28840	Beauchamps I found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would	52.062320709228516
22830/28840	I told her my orders from	169.0775909423828
22831/28840	Beauchamp she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moments reflection Yes go Florentin said she and may he come	80.8011474609375
22832/28840	Yes my mother said Albert I will return and woe to the infamous wretch But first of all I must get	50.41264724731445
22833/28840	He went back to the room where he had left Monte Crist	17.796663284301758
22834/28840	Five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his	53.98579025268555
22835/28840	His voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blueveined lids and he tottered like a drunken	48.622474670410156
22836/28840	Count said he I thank you for your hospitality which I would gladly have enjoyed longer but I must return to	45.41846466064453
22837/28840	What has happened   A great misfortune more important to me than	42.397762298583984
22838/28840	Dont question me I beg of you but lend me a	38.40309524536133
22839/28840	My stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horse	42.5136604309082
22840/28840	No it would delay me and I need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me	69.58439636230469
22841/28840	Albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the	27.267332077026367
22842/28840	Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling   Ali a horse for	74.98108673095703
22843/28840	de Morcerfquick he is in a hurry   40190m       These words restored Albert he darted from the room followed by the	13.02993106842041
22844/28840	Thank you cried he throwing himself on his	83.27332305908203
22845/28840	Return as soon as you can Florent	22.240440368652344

22847/28840	You may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate	89.31542205810547
22848/28840	Read that said he when I am gone that you may not be witness of my	69.39939880371094
22849/28840	While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an	25.78831672668457
22850/28840	He now calls himself the Count of Morcerf and ranks among the	54.93385314941406
22851/28840	The Trial   At eight oclock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamps	15.166767120361328
22852/28840	The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at	18.050264358520508
22853/28840	Well my poor friend replied Beauchamp I expected	26.343740463256836
22854/28840	I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful	52.236507415771484
22855/28840	Your having sent for me is another proof of your	95.65811157226562
22856/28840	So without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds   I think I have some cle	44.8539924621582
22857/28840	But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful	36.97978210449219
22858/28840	Beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following	52.27872085571289
22859/28840	Two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides _ lImpartial_ and what was more serious one that was well known as a government	88.26657104492188
22860/28840	Beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the	92.18224334716797
22861/28840	He sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers	31.232648849487305
22862/28840	Although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper Beauchampas it sometimes we may say often happenswas his intimate	60.987396240234375
22863/28840	The editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beetsugar probably a composition of his	178.02581787109375
22864/28840	Ah _pardieu_ said Beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend I need not tell you the cause of my	18.990217208862305
22865/28840	Are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial	95.97935485839844
22866/28840	No replied Beauchamp I have not considered the question a totally different subject interests	50.60757827758789
22867/28840	What is it   The article relative to Morcer	18.14201545715332
22868/28840	Indeed Is it not a curious affair   So curious that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of	47.813697814941406
22869/28840	Not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure	43.552547454833984
22870/28840	de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on	70.3531494140625
22871/28840	Who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing	80.20989990234375
22872/28840	de Morcerf as he is a peer of France and we are of the	24.19283103942871
22873/28840	Oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandal	61.689998626708984
22874/28840	A man arrived yesterday from Yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other	85.6261978149414
22875/28840	Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcer	78.50666809082031
22876/28840	But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of that dignified	53.43790817260742
22877/28840	Everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious	47.49181365966797
22878/28840	Some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still	97.30290985107422
22879/28840	The Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his	30.107627868652344
22880/28840	Like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his	49.06575393676758
22881/28840	The true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised	122.68949127197266

22927/28840	Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully	90.78619384765625
22928/28840	At this moment one of the doorkeepers brought in a letter for the	43.88144302368164
22929/28840	You are at liberty to speak	106.54619598388672

22931/28840	He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the	62.11463165283203
22932/28840	He produced the ring his mark of authority with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the ha	43.72032928466797

22936/28840	And what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired	98.50153350830078
22937/28840	I acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said Beauch	109.96990966796875

22948/28840	It only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed Gentlemen and you monsieuryou will not be displeased I presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented	49.513519287109375

22959/28840	I shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to	28.84745216369629

22961/28840	We shall know sir replied the	88.31145477294922
22962/28840	Is the committee willing to hear this witnessYes yes they all said at	117.94004821777344

22964/28840	Who is itA woman accompanied by a	183.0297393798828
22965/28840	Five minutes after the doorkeeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and I said Beauchamp shared the general expectation and	61.13968276977539
22966/28840	Behind the doorkeeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed	53.22267150878906
22967/28840	It was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was	43.959903717041016
22968/28840	The president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian costume and was remarkably	44.562347412109375
22969/28840	Who told you that   Alas I guess	30.193145751953125

22972/28840	de Morcerf continued Beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and	29.61449432373047
22973/28840	Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or	322.727783203125
22974/28840	To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary	104.38998413085938
22975/28840	The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of	67.91976165771484
22976/28840	As for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support	23.327974319458008
22977/28840	Madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the	24.79849624633789
22978/28840	I was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the	28.742385864257812
22979/28840	But allow me to say that you must have been very young	31.220104217529297
22980/28840	I was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my	57.72472381591797
22981/28840	In what manner could these events concern you and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on youOn them depended my fathers life replied	107.89762878417969

22983/28840	40202m       The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the	27.8211669921875
22984/28840	As for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before	30.061906814575195
22985/28840	A greenish pallor spread over the counts cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous	53.293521881103516
22986/28840	Haydée still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in	69.23700714111328
22987/28840	It had been supposed some of the papers might be in the Arabian Romaic or Turkish language and the interpreter of the House was in	52.91160583496094
22988/28840	The abovementioned purchase was made on his highnesss account whose mandate I had for the sum of four hundred thousand franc	51.712345123291016

22991/28840	Near the merchants signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime	194.91099548339844
22992/28840	A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on Haydée seemed one of fire and	85.7706069946289
22993/28840	Madame said the president may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo who is now I believe in Paris   Sir replied Haydée the Count of Monte Cristo my fosterfather has been in Normandy the last three	16.159412384033203

22997/28840	I love retirement and silence because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past	71.61620330810547
22998/28840	But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the	21.326082229614258
22999/28840	40204m       Then remarked the president the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingsHe is quite unaware of them and I have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what I have	17.909412384033203
23000/28840	But it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which I find at last an opportunity of avenging my father   The count had not uttered one word the whole of this	26.676372528076172
23001/28840	His colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a	34.96519088745117
23002/28840	His misery was depicted in sinister lines on his count	124.75819396972656
23003/28840	de Morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of YaninaNo said Morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my	19.951021194458008
23004/28840	Haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked You do not know me said	33.69596481323242
23005/28840	de Morcerf as the officer Fernand MondegoIndeed I do cried Hayd	29.945341110229492

23007/28840	This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused	136.4519805908203
23008/28840	Count of Morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down	24.46923828125
23009/28840	The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of God it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending	44.01102066040039

23011/28840	Then all the members looked at each other with	19.607519149780273
23012/28840	They knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend	68.52287292480469
23013/28840	They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery	66.65672302246094
23014/28840	Well asked the president what is your decision   40206m       I have no reply to make said the count in a low	8.602194786071777
23015/28840	Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth said the	18.74042320251465
23016/28840	Is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead Not guilty Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his	74.38172912597656
23017/28840	Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named	115.32624816894531
23018/28840	Gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this HouseYes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous	76.10563659667969
23019/28840	Haydée had remained until the close of the	116.57868194580078
23020/28840	She heard the counts sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes to his goddess	42.54044723510742
23021/28840	The Challenge   Then continued Beauchamp I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being	38.25669479370117
23022/28840	The usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de Vaugir	28.486984252929688

23029/28840	Contempt my friend How does this misfortune affect you No happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fathers	181.25872802734375
23030/28840	Review your life Albert although it is only just beginning did a lovely summers day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career No Albert take my	170.77249145507812

23032/28840	You will return after three or four years with a Russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years	63.76246643066406
23033/28840	Thank you my dear Beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it cannot	42.58292770385742
23034/28840	I have told you my wish or rather my	50.37733459472656
23035/28840	You understand that interested as I am in this affair I cannot see it in the same light as you	47.934104919433594
23036/28840	What appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less	78.42581176757812
23037/28840	Now I repeat Beauchamp I wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the	55.86189270019531
23038/28840	Be it so said Beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth I submit and if you will seek your enemy I will assist you and I will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as	47.22272872924805
23039/28840	Well then you understand Beauchamp that we begin our search	110.36353302001953

23041/28840	The calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives	28.038427352905273
23042/28840	Ah Beauchamp I see you know something already you will restore me to	51.11993408203125
23043/28840	I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more	29.623937606811523
23044/28840	Well I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from Yan	21.01532745361328
23045/28840	I went of course to the chief banker of the town to make	132.1613006591797
23046/28840	At the first word before I had even mentioned your fathers name   Ah said	60.07237243652344
23047/28840	How and why   Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same	39.11867904663086
23048/28840	By whom   By a banker of Paris my	98.40182495117188
23049/28840	He cried Albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous	63.36731719970703
23050/28840	He the man who would be popular cannot forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assignedyes it is all from the same	83.32841491699219
23051/28840	Make inquiries Albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true   Oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all I have	38.728485107421875
23052/28840	Beware Morcerf he is already an old	102.72086334228516
23053/28840	I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally Oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to	63.20993423461914
23054/28840	I do not condemn you Albert I only restrain	56.329750061035156
23055/28840	Oh do not fear besides you will accompany	23.96381378173828
23056/28840	Beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a	195.25814819335938
23057/28840	Danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or I shall	23.199378967285156
23058/28840	_Pardieu_ Beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral   When such resolutions are made Albert they should be promptly	89.55171966552734
23059/28840	Do you wish to go to	23.433128356933594
23060/28840	On entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of	109.28339385986328
23061/28840	Ah _parbleu_ thats good said Albert with a gloomy	25.78247833251953
23062/28840	Danglars will not fight with me I will kill his soninlaw Cavalcanti will certainly	15.262784004211426
23063/28840	The servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him	40.762760162353516
23064/28840	It was however too late Albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the bankers	37.698482513427734
23065/28840	Sir cried the latter am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house You appear to forget yourself	63.70308303833008
23066/28840	No sir said Albert coldly there are circumstances in which one cannot except through cowardiceI offer you that refugerefuse to admit certain persons at	107.3382339477539
23067/28840	Danglars turned pale Cavalcanti moved a step forward and Albert turned towards	24.096519470214844
23068/28840	And you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept	37.394474029541016
23069/28840	Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young	25.76569938659668
23070/28840	Alberts attack on Andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first	73.05767822265625
23071/28840	Indeed sir said he to Albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you I shall resign the case to the kings	30.112348556518555
23072/28840	You mistake sir said Morcerf with a gloomy smile I am not referring in the least to matrimony and I only addressed myself to	29.24881362915039
23073/28840	Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between	456.7368469238281
23074/28840	In one respect you are right for I am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim	59.97895050048828
23075/28840	Now if you are mad and try to bite me I will kill you without	27.922012329101562
23076/28840	Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself   Yes miserable wretch cried Morcerf it is your	25.91879653930664
23077/28840	My fault said he you must be mad What do I know of the Grecian affair Have I travelled in that country Did I advise your father to sell the castle of Yaninato betray   Silence said Albert with a thundering	53.07684326171875
23078/28840	No it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked	69.89479064941406
23079/28840	I   Yes you How came it known   I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina   Who wrote to Yanina   To Yanina  	26.77896499633789
23080/28840	Who wrote for particulars concerning my father   I imagine anyone may write to Yan	86.68073272705078
23081/28840	But one person only wrote   One only   Yes and that was you   I doubtless	54.747005462646484
23082/28840	It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a	35.50059127807617
23083/28840	You wrote sir knowing what answer you would	403.3470458984375
23084/28840	Who then urged you to write Tell	220.0081024169922
23085/28840	_Pardieu_ it was the most simple thing in the	35.13172912597656
23086/28840	I was speaking of your fathers past	102.45977783203125
23087/28840	I said the origin of his fortune remained	102.47028350830078
23088/28840	The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property I answered In	105.3467788696289
23089/28840	And who thus advised you   No other than your friend Monte Crist	32.161563873291016
23090/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina   Yes and I wrote and will show you my correspondence if you	18.298038482666016
23091/28840	Albert and Beauchamp looked at each	11.753562927246094
23092/28840	Sir said Beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from Paris at this moment and cannot justify	27.55317497253418
23093/28840	I accuse no one sir said Danglars I relate and I will repeat before the count what I have said to	31.695533752441406
23094/28840	Does the count know what answer you received   Yes I showed it to	71.06501007080078
23095/28840	Did he know my fathers Christian name was Fernand and his family name Mondego   Yes I had told him that long since and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps	45.27959060668945
23096/28840	When the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughters hand for you I decidedly refused him but without any explanation or	52.68985366821289
23097/28840	In short why should I have any more to do with the affair How did the honor or disgrace of	48.78388977050781
23098/28840	de Morcerf affect me It neither increased nor decreased my	140.98878479003906
23099/28840	Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the	47.70329666137695
23100/28840	Danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through	49.65552520751953
23101/28840	In addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his	212.9490509033203
23102/28840	Monte Cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha and knowing everything he had advised Danglars to write to Yan	31.33011817932129
23103/28840	Besides had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his fathers name before Haydée Lastly he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was	36.0283088684082
23104/28840	There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged Monte Cristo then was in league with his fathers	73.88359069824219
23105/28840	Albert took Beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to	189.2382354736328
23106/28840	You are right said the latter	87.54685974121094
23107/28840	Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of	22.15369987487793
23108/28840	de Monte Cristo that you must demand an	21.026926040649414
23109/28840	Sir said he to Danglars understand that I do not take a final leave of you I must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Crist	24.130645751953125
23110/28840	He bowed to the banker and went out with Beauchamp without appearing to notice Cavalc	32.895606994628906
23111/28840	Danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcer	20.95185089111328
23112/28840	The Insult   At the bankers door Beauchamp stopped Morcer	30.7152156829834
23113/28840	Listen said he just now I told you it was of	42.288822174072266
23114/28840	de Monte Cristo you must demand an	23.28887939453125
23115/28840	Yes and we are going to his	24.76463508605957
23116/28840	Reflect Morcerf one moment before you	332.12725830078125
23117/28840	On what shall I reflect   On the importance of the step you are	70.76598358154297
23118/28840	Is it more serious than going to	148.8875732421875
23119/28840	Danglars is a moneylover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a	56.453792572021484
23120/28840	The other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully   I only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not	37.768863677978516
23121/28840	Do not be alarmed said Beauchamp he will meet	37.611045837402344
23122/28840	My only fear is that he will be too strong for	89.83382415771484
23123/28840	My friend said Morcerf with a sweet smile that is what I	13.807428359985352
23124/28840	The happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us	57.78544616699219
23125/28840	My poor mother said Albert passing his hand across his eyes I know she would but better so than die of	80.04884338378906
23126/28840	Are you quite decided Albert   Yes let us	31.864803314208984
23127/28840	But do you think we shall find the count at home   He intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at	57.20762252807617
23128/28840	They ordered the driver to take them to	79.04166412353516
23129/28840	Beauchamp wished to go in alone but Albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of du	58.41753005981445
23130/28840	The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following Morcer	35.09144592285156
23131/28840	Albert sprang from the porters lodge to the	49.10299301147461
23132/28840	The count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be	46.800777435302734
23133/28840	And after dinner   He will sleep an	37.30801010131836
23134/28840	Then   He is going to the	17.38825035095215
23135/28840	Are you sure of it asked	35.286930084228516
23136/28840	Quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock	50.989009857177734
23137/28840	Very good replied Albert that is all I wished to	56.888153076171875
23138/28840	Then turning towards Beauchamp If you have anything to attend to Beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till	28.636754989624023
23139/28840	I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera and if you can bring ChâteauRenaud with	15.86678409576416
23140/28840	Beauchamp availed himself of Alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before	56.91903305053711
23141/28840	On his return home Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray and Morrel to see them at the Opera that	41.115074157714844
23142/28840	Then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her	33.80112838745117
23143/28840	He found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public	127.7615737915039
23144/28840	The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercédès she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved	45.314334869384766
23145/28840	Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers	126.2537841796875
23146/28840	It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing	63.74435043334961
23147/28840	My dear mother said he do you know if	52.90138626098633
23148/28840	de Morcerf has any enemy   Mercédès started she noticed that the young man did not say my	20.33243751525879
23149/28840	My son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret	331.7615966796875
23150/28840	Those who are known are not the most	123.79800415039062
23151/28840	I know it and appeal to your	91.78687286376953
23152/28840	You are of so superior a mind nothing escapes	210.29327392578125
23153/28840	Why do you say so   Because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that	51.23358154296875
23154/28840	de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our	79.9547348022461
23155/28840	Mercédès raised herself on her feverish	8.758156776428223
23156/28840	de Monte Cristo she exclaimed and how is he connected with the question you asked me   40219m       You know mother	15.189278602600098
23157/28840	de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their	65.4800796508789
23158/28840	de Monte Cristo is our enemy replied Mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered	22.239585876464844
23159/28840	Who told you so Why you are mad Albert	117.79178619384766
23160/28840	de Monte Cristo has only shown us	158.72914123535156
23161/28840	de Monte Cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to	103.76141357421875
23162/28840	Oh I entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his	55.951812744140625
23163/28840	Mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that	35.43874740600586
23164/28840	I said Mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than	14.92930793762207
23165/28840	Yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm   Mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze You speak strangely said she to Albert and you appear to have some singular	28.706165313720703
23166/28840	What has the count done Three days since you were with him in Normandy only three days since we looked on him as our best	58.90695571899414
23167/28840	An ironical smile passed over Alberts	18.145328521728516
23168/28840	Mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strongminded she concealed both her sorrows and her	37.50164031982422
23169/28840	Albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed   You came to inquire after my health I will candidly acknowledge that I am not	37.748741149902344
23170/28840	You should install yourself here and cheer my	529.3207397460938
23171/28840	I do not wish to be left	12.112908363342285
23172/28840	Mother said the young man you know how gladly I would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole	42.426021575927734
23173/28840	Well replied Mercédès sighing go Albert I will not make you a slave to your filial	26.51892852783203
23174/28840	Albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted	103.23182678222656
23175/28840	Scarcely had he shut her door when Mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he	42.19034194946289
23176/28840	Then she rang for her ladys maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might	51.2133674621582
23177/28840	The footmans mission was an easy	152.0536346435547
23178/28840	Albert went to his room and dressed with unusual	118.51016235351562
23179/28840	At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived he had seen ChâteauRenaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was	27.554988861083984
23180/28840	Both got into Alberts _coupé_ and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud To the	27.58763885498047

23182/28840	40221m       ChâteauRenaud was at his post apprised by Beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from	16.091588973999023
23183/28840	The conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that ChâteauRenaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of	33.72793960571289
23184/28840	Debray was not yet come but Albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the	44.406761169433594
23185/28840	Albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn	74.14026641845703
23186/28840	de Monte Cristo either in the lobby or on the	28.398452758789062
23187/28840	The bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with ChâteauRenaud and Beauch	17.20662498474121
23188/28840	But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first	39.90235900878906
23189/28840	At last as Albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and Monte Cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the	28.18223762512207
23190/28840	Morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother inlaw he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to	80.21723937988281
23191/28840	The count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his	50.13907241821289
23192/28840	He recognized Albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomp	83.05770874023438
23193/28840	Without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another	81.12799072265625
23194/28840	Although apparently not noticing Albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two	24.0516414642334
23195/28840	Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on	35.10799026489258
23196/28840	He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel but he was well prepared for what might	47.01587677001953
23197/28840	The door opened and Monte Cristo turning round saw Albert pale and trembling followed by Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	10.671924591064453
23198/28840	Well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his	45.741127014160156
23199/28840	The countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordial	41.81480026245117
23200/28840	Morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the Opera but he understood that something terrible was bro	24.73493003845215
23201/28840	We are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said Albert but to demand an	58.744239807128906
23202/28840	The young mans trembling voice was scarcely	66.49751281738281
23203/28840	An explanation at the Opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is	56.35387420654297
23204/28840	Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians I should not have thought this the place for such a	62.32391357421875
23205/28840	Still if people will shut themselves up said Albert and cannot be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be	71.0674819946289
23206/28840	I am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my	69.56005096435547
23207/28840	Yesterday I was at your house sir said the young man because then I knew not who you	37.26511764526367
23208/28840	In pronouncing these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the	44.52653503417969
23209/28840	Thus the attention of many was attracted by this	117.392333984375
23210/28840	Where are you come from sir  said Monte Cristo You do not appear to be in the possession of your	37.30278396606445
23211/28840	Provided I understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged I shall be reasonable enough said Albert	85.21720123291016
23212/28840	I do not understand you sir replied Monte Cristo and if I did your tone is too	29.84914779663086
23213/28840	I am at home here and I alone have a right to raise my voice above another	52.40007781982422
23214/28840	Leave the box sir   Monte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding	33.19627380371094
23215/28840	Ah I shall know how to make you leave your home replied Albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which Monte Cristo did not lose sight	23.634811401367188
23216/28840	Well well said Monte Cristo quietly I see you wish to quarrel with me but I would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in	27.731107711791992
23217/28840	It is in poor taste to make a display of a	86.85057067871094
23218/28840	Display is not becoming to everyone	363.6844177246094
23219/28840	At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this	57.33001708984375
23220/28840	They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole	47.8401985168457
23221/28840	Albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when Morrel seized his hand while Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him	34.505916595458984
23222/28840	Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the	52.73741149902344
23223/28840	Wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed Albert stepped back and Morrel closed the	47.38767623901367
23224/28840	Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like	61.931236267089844
23225/28840	Morrel whispered What have you done to him   I Nothingat least personally said Monte Crist	26.935903549194336
23226/28840	But there must be some cause for this strange	60.77419662475586
23227/28840	The Count of Morcerfs adventure exasperates the young	17.655439376831055
23228/28840	Have you anything to do with it   It was through Haydée that the Chamber was informed of his fathers	38.929237365722656
23229/28840	I had been told but would not credit it that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali P	36.864845275878906
23230/28840	Then said Morrel I understand it all and this scene was premed	37.471519470214844
23231/28840	Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer	74.4218521118164
23232/28840	Probably said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquill	8.47994327545166
23233/28840	But what shall you do with him   With whom   With	24.34445571899414
23234/28840	What shall I do with Albert As certainly Maximilian as I now press your hand I shall kill him before ten oclock tomorrow	38.6429557800293
23235/28840	Morrel in his turn took Monte Cristos hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it	36.03763198852539
23236/28840	Ah count said he his father loves him so much   Do not speak to me of that said Monte Cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed I will make him	37.80275344848633
23237/28840	Morrel amazed let fall Monte Cristos	70.89030456542969

23239/28840	Bravo bravo   Morrel saw it was useless to say more and ref	74.72698974609375
23240/28840	The curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with Albert again fell and a rap was heard at the	73.37625885009766
23241/28840	Come in said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately Beauchamp	35.74522399902344
23242/28840	Beauchamp said Monte Cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be	23.622936248779297
23243/28840	Beauchamp bowed and sitting down Sir said he I just now accompanied	124.75931549072266
23244/28840	And that means replied Monte Cristo laughing that you had probably just dined	70.05581665039062
23245/28840	Beauchamp that you are more sober than he	51.95423126220703
23246/28840	Beauchamp Albert was wrong I acknowledge to betray so much anger and I come on my own account to apologize for	77.26480865478516
23247/28840	And having done so entirely on my own account be it understood I would add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yan	78.3778076171875
23248/28840	Then I will add two words about the young Greek	43.38673400878906
23249/28840	Monte Cristo motioned him to be	60.24443435668945
23250/28840	Come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be	65.94636535644531
23251/28840	Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric	165.0329132080078
23252/28840	I am in your opinion a Lara a Manfred a Lord Ruthven then just as I am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of	47.52791213989258
23253/28840	You bring me down to your own level and demand explanations Indeed	118.85163116455078
23254/28840	Yet replied Beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands  	34.49694061279297
23255/28840	Beauchamp interposed this strange man the Count of Monte Cristo bows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo	23.923938751220703
23256/28840	Beauchamp and it is always well	83.68770599365234
23257/28840	Sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such	26.08152198791504
23258/28840	I am sir a living guaranty replied Monte Cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guarant	39.4987678527832
23259/28840	Tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock I shall see what color his	71.15934753417969
23260/28840	Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel said Beauch	43.08083724975586
23261/28840	It is quite immaterial to me said Monte Cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a tr	20.689605712890625

23263/28840	Sure to gain repeated Beauchamp looking with amazement at the	31.152366638183594
23264/28840	Certainly said Monte Cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise I would not fight with	18.758317947387695
23265/28840	I shall kill himI cannot help	40.71543884277344
23266/28840	Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour I do not like to be kept	49.91500473022461

23268/28840	Now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend Albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his illchosen barbarisms let him go home and go to	52.773345947265625
23269/28840	Now said Monte Cristo turning towards Morrel I may depend upon you may I not   Certainly said Morrel I am at your service count still   What   It is desirable I should know the real	21.357139587402344
23270/28840	That is to say you would rather not  	39.55820083618164

23272/28840	Enough said Morrel who is your second witness   I know no one in Paris Morrel on whom I could confer that honor besides you and your brother	46.0350341796875

23276/28840	The Night   Monte Cristo waited according to his usual custom until Duprez had sung his famous _Suivezmoi_ then he rose and went	25.476757049560547
23277/28840	Morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oclock and to bring	28.73209571838379
23278/28840	Then he stepped into his _coupé_ calm and smiling and was at home in five	30.089723587036133
23279/28840	No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said   Ali bring me my pistols with the ivory	85.417724609375
23280/28840	Ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and	47.57503890991211
23281/28840	These were pistols of an especial pattern which Monte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own	34.36617660522461
23282/28840	A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand	67.99015045166016
23283/28840	He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and Baptistin	60.464935302734375
23284/28840	Before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after Baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed	40.76060485839844
23285/28840	Baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after	40.853797912597656
23286/28840	Who are you madame said the count to the veiled	26.730390548706055
23287/28840	What name did you pronounce then Madame de Morcerf said	51.8219108581543
23288/28840	Yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which I alone perhaps have not	210.99850463867188
23289/28840	Edmond it is not Madame de Morcerf who is come to you it is Mercédè	14.55592155456543
23290/28840	Mercédès is dead madame said Monte Cristo I know no one now of that	13.125380516052246
23291/28840	Fernand do you mean replied Monte Cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them	38.59614562988281
23292/28840	Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every	28.984375
23293/28840	You see Edmond I am not mistaken and have cause to say Spare my son   And who told you madame that I have any hostile intentions against your son   No one in truth but a mother has twofold	43.6876106262207
23294/28840	I guessed all I followed him this evening to the Opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen	115.35248565673828
23295/28840	If you have seen all madame you know that the son of Fernand has publicly insulted me said Monte Cristo with awful calm	30.872669219970703
23296/28840	Oh for pitys sake   You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel one of my friends had not stopped	34.62948989868164
23297/28840	Listen to me my son has also guessed who you arehe attributes his fathers misfortunes to	65.60616302490234
23298/28840	Madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunesit is a	24.648468017578125
23299/28840	It is not I who strike	157.5886993408203
23300/28840	de Morcerf it is Providence which punishes	41.94012451171875
23301/28840	And why do you represent Providence cried Mercédè	21.296981811523438
23302/28840	It does not concern me you are right and if I have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the French captain or the Count of Morcerf but on the fisherman Fernand the husband of Mercédès the Catal	14.351802825927734
23303/28840	Ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commitfor I am the only culprit Edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my	60.66533279418945
23304/28840	But exclaimed Monte Cristo why was I absent And why were you alone   40231m       Because you had been arrested Edmond and were a	18.562267303466797
23305/28840	And why was I arrested Why was I a prisoner   I do not know said Mercédè	22.160030364990234
23306/28840	You do not madame at least I hope	43.27296447753906
23307/28840	I was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of La Réserve the day before I was to marry you a man named Danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman Fernand himself	32.336944580078125
23308/28840	Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned Edmond Dantès who either carries the letter for Paris about with him or has it at his fathers ab	23.172170639038086
23309/28840	Should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the _Pharaon	20.99610137939453
23310/28840	And the result of that letter   You well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest	43.157413482666016
23311/28840	You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the Château d	21.379688262939453
23312/28840	That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it and that is why on account of the living Mercédès and my deceased father I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand andI have revenged	37.742530822753906
23313/28840	Compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married	69.29914093017578

23318/28840	Her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised	139.45663452148438
23319/28840	Then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of Monte Cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening	43.049827575683594
23320/28840	Mercédès I must revenge myself for I suffered fourteen yearsfourteen years I wept I cursed now I tell you Mercédès I must revenge	30.636194229125977
23321/28840	The count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his	54.80742263793945
23322/28840	Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet why should I seek to make myself better than God   Edmond continued Mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since I first knew you I have adored your name have respected your	41.903194427490234

23324/28840	Mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that Monte Cristo could not restrain a	14.143767356872559
23325/28840	The lion was daunted the avenger was	171.03131103515625

23329/28840	What do you say Edmond   I say since you command me Mercédès I must	14.708916664123535
23330/28840	What I most loved after you Mercédès was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men that strength was my	89.14717864990234
23331/28840	With one word you have crushed it and I	97.25694274902344
23332/28840	But the duel will not take place Edmond since you forgive   It will take place said Monte Cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your sons blood to stain the ground mine will	64.2733154296875
23333/28840	Mercédès shrieked and sprang towards Monte Cristo but suddenly stopping Edmond said she there is a God above us since you live and since I have seen you again I trust to him from my	23.909202575683594
23334/28840	While waiting his assistance I trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not   Yes madame he shall live said Monte Cristo surprised that without more emotion Mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for	44.578338623046875
23335/28840	Mercédès extended her hand to the	4.983583927154541
23336/28840	Ah believe me Edmond as I told you I too have suffered much I repeat it is melancholy to pass ones life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet	73.3531723022461
23337/28840	No it is not finished I feel it by what remains in my	79.83023834228516
23338/28840	Oh I repeat it Edmond what you have just done is beautifulit is grand it is	82.42729949951172
23339/28840	Mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her	19.06109619140625
23340/28840	Monte Cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its	37.380645751953125
23341/28840	Edmond said Mercédès I have but one word more to say to	9.72925090789795
23342/28840	Edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if Mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the	43.6370735168457
23343/28840	Adieu then Edmond I have nothing more to ask of heavenI have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you	46.18254089355469
23344/28840	Mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged	25.13028907775879
23345/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the ChampsÉlysées and made Monte Cristo raise his	22.700239181518555
23346/28840	The Meeting   After Mercédès had left Monte Cristo he fell into profound	35.76024627685547
23347/28840	Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme	157.58990478515625
23348/28840	No it is not existence then that I regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously	82.52818298339844
23349/28840	Providence is now opposed to them when I most thought it would be prop	157.65664672851562
23350/28840	It is not Gods will that they should be	65.736083984375
23351/28840	This burden almost as heavy as a world which I had raised and I had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my	54.698421478271484
23352/28840	There are virtues which become crimes by	485.98846435546875
23353/28840	No she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear	77.8904037475586
23354/28840	The blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his	91.02972412109375
23355/28840	Ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on	189.1276397705078
23356/28840	I ridiculous No I would rather	235.43678283691406
23357/28840	Seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in Paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his	53.59164047241211
23358/28840	I do this Oh my God said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for	83.65570831298828
23359/28840	I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like Morcerf Danglars Villefort even Morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their	41.033775329589844
23360/28840	Let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by Providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for	62.974971771240234
23361/28840	While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertaintieswretched waking dreams of griefthe first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of	74.80049896240234
23362/28840	It was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his	19.311458587646484
23363/28840	He turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its	52.90211868286133
23364/28840	He arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw Haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown	27.22409439086914
23365/28840	She had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with	75.35231018066406
23366/28840	The noise of the door did not awaken her and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate	37.1948356628418
23367/28840	She remembered that she had a son said he and I forgot I had a	55.09053039550781
23368/28840	Then shaking his head sorrowfully Poor Haydée said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed	40.973567962646484
23369/28840	Oh I cannot go without taking leave of her I cannot die without confiding her to	78.64930725097656
23370/28840	These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at Monte Cristo of which Bertuccio knows the	48.499542236328125
23371/28840	40241m       He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his	25.902616500854492
23372/28840	Well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled	45.12036895751953
23373/28840	Well if any misfortune happen to me replied Monte Cristo I wish my daughter to be	12.675315856933594
23374/28840	Haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her	47.06293487548828
23375/28840	Do you think of dying my lord said	93.37743377685547
23376/28840	The wise man my child has said It is good to think of	109.2936019897461
23377/28840	Well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die I shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the	48.94203567504883
23378/28840	Then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the	92.60438537597656
23379/28840	Alas murmured he with intense suffering I might then have been happy	53.94002914428711
23380/28840	Then he carried Haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed	68.36934661865234
23381/28840	As he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was	27.62373161315918
23382/28840	Monte Cristo approached the window and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel al	30.2501277923584
23383/28840	Good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three	141.12310791015625
23384/28840	A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door	25.792356491088867
23385/28840	Morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time	92.87657165527344
23386/28840	I am perhaps come too soon count said he but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my	58.715171813964844
23387/28840	I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover	79.54707336425781
23388/28840	Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open	29.2116756439209
23389/28840	Morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that I am beloved by such a man as	17.622451782226562
23390/28840	Goodmorning Emmanuel you will come with me then Maximilian   Did you doubt it said the young	26.23773193359375
23391/28840	But if I were wrong   I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday I have been thinking of your firmness all night and I said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied	37.202720642089844
23392/28840	But Morrel Albert is your friend   Simply an acquaintance	82.62981414794922
23393/28840	You met on the same day you first saw me   Yes that is true but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded	36.157432556152344
23394/28840	said he to Ali who came immediately take that to my	449.8820495605469
23395/28840	When I am dead you will go and examine	30.334083557128906
23396/28840	What said Morrel you dead   Yes must I not be prepared for everything dear friend But what did you do yesterday after you left me   I went to Tortonis where as I expected I found Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	21.450214385986328
23397/28840	Why when all was arranged   Listen count the affair is serious and	137.54454040527344
23398/28840	Did you doubt it   No the offence was public and everyone is already talking of	72.98274993896484
23399/28840	Well   Well I hoped to get an exchange of armsto substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is	68.82735443115234
23400/28840	Have you succeeded asked Monte Cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of	32.291595458984375
23401/28840	No for your skill with the sword is so well	53.795658111572266
23402/28840	Ahwho has betrayed me   The skilful swordsman whom you have	49.881103515625
23403/28840	And you failed   They positively	244.10586547851562
23404/28840	Morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol  	27.248945236206055
23405/28840	Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the	49.775962829589844
23406/28840	He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than bucks	36.54367446899414
23407/28840	Then turning towards Monte Cristo Count said he in the name of all that is dear to you I entreat you not to kill Albertthe unhappy youth has a	43.801815032958984
23408/28840	You are right said Monte Cristo and I have	15.649282455444336
23409/28840	These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel	35.92675018310547
23410/28840	Doubtless what does that imply   That you will fire	122.07190704345703
23411/28840	I fire first   Oh I obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us	70.28511810302734
23412/28840	And at what distance   Twenty p	47.51405715942383
23413/28840	A smile of terrible import passed over the counts	88.39204406738281
23414/28840	Morrel said he do not forget what you have just	16.08949089050293
23415/28840	The only chance for Alberts safety then will arise from your	84.32268524169922
23416/28840	I suffer from emotion said Monte Crist	73.69489288330078
23417/28840	Or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are I may say what would appear absurd to	98.59608459472656
23418/28840	What is that   Break his armwound himbut do not kill	57.656307220458984
23419/28840	I will tell you Morrel said the count that I do not need entreating to spare the life of	22.486328125
23420/28840	de Morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while I   And you   That will be another thing I shall be brought	32.20289611816406
23421/28840	No no cried Maximilian quite unable to restrain his	44.23530960083008
23422/28840	As I told you my dear Morrel	23.139497756958008
23423/28840	Morrel looked at him in utter amaz	19.139345169067383
23424/28840	But what has happened then since last evening count   The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi I have seen a	49.20647430419922
23425/28840	And that ghost   Told me Morrel that I had lived long	70.43209838867188
23426/28840	Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each	9.317667961120605
23427/28840	Let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight o	40.497779846191406
23428/28840	A carriage was in readiness at the	39.54390335083008
23429/28840	Monte Cristo stepped into it with his two	109.13477325439453
23430/28840	He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and Maximilian and Emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from	66.82213592529297
23431/28840	As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of	57.4326171875
23432/28840	We are first said Morrel looking out of the	44.368934631347656
23433/28840	Excuse me sir said Baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but I think I see a carriage down there under the	32.9860725402832
23434/28840	Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximil	46.17210388183594
23435/28840	The latter retained the counts hand between	76.47837829589844
23436/28840	I like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his	85.54053497314453
23437/28840	It seems to me said Emmanuel that I see two young men down there who are evidently	68.21821594238281
23438/28840	Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brotherin	87.0883560180664
23439/28840	Maximilian said he are your affections disengaged Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with aston	13.50543212890625
23440/28840	I do not seek your confidence my dear	25.807003021240234
23441/28840	I only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all I	68.87643432617188
23442/28840	Do you love her much   More than my	53.417030334472656
23443/28840	Then with a sigh Poor Haydée murmured	35.77280807495117
23444/28840	To tell the truth count if I knew less of you I should think that you were less brave than you	51.366676330566406
23445/28840	Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving Come Morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of	80.51211547851562
23446/28840	Do I regret life What is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death Moreover do not alarm yourself Morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you	69.1796875
23447/28840	I know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor	71.6132583618164
23448/28840	Have you brought your arms   Iwhat for I hope these gentlemen have	106.00947570800781
23449/28840	Do but make no treatyyou understand me   You need not	39.538822174072266
23450/28840	Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud who seeing his intention came to meet	11.004986763000488
23451/28840	The three young men bowed to each other courteously if not aff	68.09673309326172
23452/28840	Excuse me gentlemen said Morrel but I do not see	50.45922088623047
23453/28840	He sent us word this morning replied ChâteauRenaud that he would meet us on the	27.67636489868164
23454/28840	It is only five minutes past eight said he to Morrel there is not much time lost	38.354454040527344
23455/28840	Oh I made no allusion of that kind replied Mor	55.1639289855957
23456/28840	There is a carriage coming said ChâteauRen	13.43658447265625
23457/28840	It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were	43.377784729003906
23458/28840	You are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen	323.34869384765625
23459/28840	de Monte Cristo yields his right of using	47.288761138916016
23460/28840	We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said Beauchamp and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar	49.80229187011719
23461/28840	They are quite new and have not yet been	99.40298461914062
23462/28840	Beauchamp if you assure me that	63.12053680419922
23463/28840	de Morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite	40.666542053222656
23464/28840	Gentlemen said ChâteauRenaud it is not Morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is Franz and Debray   The two young men he announced were indeed	37.45649719238281
23465/28840	What chance brings you here gentlemen said ChâteauRenaud shaking hands with each of	26.88053321838379
23466/28840	Because said Debray Albert sent this morning to request us to	65.19868469238281
23467/28840	Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud exchanged looks of aston	9.709485054016113
23468/28840	I think I understand his reason said Mor	55.19597244262695
23469/28840	What is it   Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from	29.93280601501465
23470/28840	de Morcerf begging me to attend the	33.79250717163086
23471/28840	And we too added Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	10.552993774414062
23472/28840	Having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the	109.05242156982422
23473/28840	Exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed	80.46671295166016
23474/28840	But after all these arrangements he does not come himself said ChâteauRen	27.187305450439453
23475/28840	There he comes said Beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a	20.030303955078125
23476/28840	How imprudent said ChâteauRenaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions I had given	29.152515411376953
23477/28840	And besides said Beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat Why has he not painted a spot upon his heartit would have been more	44.24797821044922
23478/28840	Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young	38.81218719482422
23479/28840	He jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined	38.444087982177734
23480/28840	He was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not	20.48011589050293
23481/28840	A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to	50.61289978027344
23482/28840	I thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request I feel extremely grateful for this mark of	36.8317756652832
23483/28840	Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached and remained at a short	33.216705322265625
23484/28840	40248m       Sir said Maximilian you are not perhaps aware that I am	10.920369148254395
23485/28840	de Monte Cristos friend   I was not sure but I thought it might be	25.497610092163086
23486/28840	So much the better the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be	70.8804702758789
23487/28840	Morrel said ChâteauRenaud will you apprise the Count of Monte Cristo that	9.230453491210938
23488/28840	de Morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal   Morrel was preparing to fulfil his	44.654022216796875
23489/28840	Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the	133.3204345703125
23490/28840	Stop gentlemen said Albert I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Crist	14.489461898803711
23491/28840	No sir before all who are	141.69085693359375
23492/28840	Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper and Morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with	28.837406158447266
23493/28840	What does he want with me said Monte Crist	11.571646690368652
23494/28840	I do not know but he wishes to speak to	10.369379043579102
23495/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo I trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult   I do not think that such is his intention said Mor	18.86842155456543
23496/28840	The count advanced accompanied by Maximilian and	42.91580581665039
23497/28840	His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Alberts griefstricken face who approached also followed by the other four young	76.99107360839844
23498/28840	When at three paces distant from each other Albert and the count	46.15559387207031
23499/28840	Sir said Albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer I reproached you with exposing the conduct of	44.622745513916016
23500/28840	de Morcerf in Epirus for guilty as I knew he was I thought you had no right to punish him but I have since learned that you had that	30.455656051635742
23501/28840	Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did Alberts	19.50004005432129
23502/28840	As for Monte Cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite	14.462169647216797
23503/28840	He could not understand how Alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this	39.68896484375
23504/28840	He recognized the influence of Mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be	49.23435974121094
23505/28840	Now sir said Albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your	78.30354309082031
23506/28840	Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess I rank that of candidly acknowledging a	121.40503692626953
23507/28840	I acted well as a man but you have acted better than	58.038753509521484
23508/28840	An angel alone could have saved one of us from deaththat angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each	111.15181732177734
23509/28840	Monte Cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful	71.8235855102539
23510/28840	I hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience	69.2252197265625
23511/28840	But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies I shall endeavor to correct his	76.35652160644531
23512/28840	What happened during the night asked Beauchamp of ChâteauRenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure	30.860498428344727
23513/28840	In truth what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the bar	56.28013610839844
23514/28840	What can it mean said Debray to	55.4056396484375
23515/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to	18.8427791595459
23516/28840	de Morcerf and is justified by his son Had I ten Yaninas in my family I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten	75.0701675415039
23517/28840	As for Monte Cristo his head was bent down his arms were	38.80976486206055
23518/28840	Mother and Son   The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with Maximilian and	17.817651748657227
23519/28840	Albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just	51.730018615722656
23520/28840	Indeed my dear friend said Beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhopedfor conclusion of a very disagreeable	25.379682540893555
23521/28840	Albert remained silent and wrapped in	137.2727508544922
23522/28840	ChâteauRenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible	20.507543563842773
23523/28840	Are we not going said he after this embarrassing	187.66156005859375
23524/28840	When you please replied Beauchamp allow me only to compliment	51.181583404541016
23525/28840	de Morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric	94.4315185546875
23526/28840	It is magnificent continued Beauchamp to be able to exercise so much selfcontrol   Assuredly as for me I should have been incapable of it said ChâteauRenaud with most significant cool	16.72220802307129
23527/28840	Gentlemen interrupted Albert I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between	142.7291717529297
23528/28840	May I give you a friendly counsel Set out for Naples the Hague or	66.38374328613281

23530/28840	Seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to France after a few	157.35923767089844
23531/28840	de ChâteauRenaud   40252m       That is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsw	21.467849731445312
23532/28840	Thank you gentlemen replied Albert with a smile of indifference I shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because I had before intended to quit	55.11891174316406
23533/28840	I thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my	59.0728874206543
23534/28840	It is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said I remember that	43.30501174926758
23535/28840	Goodbye Albert said Beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young	22.327533721923828
23536/28840	The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered	34.117515563964844
23537/28840	Goodbye said ChâteauRenaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his	25.36286163330078
23538/28840	Alberts lips scarcely whispered Goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous	138.11231994628906
23539/28840	He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of	45.59335708618164
23540/28840	In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du He	9.674386978149414
23541/28840	As he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts	38.207210540771484
23542/28840	Albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own	34.01611328125
23543/28840	He cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter	74.5408706665039
23544/28840	Then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and	76.85143280029297
23545/28840	At the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his	110.55235290527344
23546/28840	What do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry	24.35228729248047
23547/28840	Pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the Count of Morcerf has called	23.259397506713867
23548/28840	I did not like to go to him without first seeing	41.854068756103516
23549/28840	Why   Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the meeting this	25.516572952270508
23550/28840	40254m       It is probable said	10.193233489990234
23551/28840	And since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened	61.077552795410156
23552/28840	What must I answer   The	85.72526550292969
23553/28840	Then I shall say the duel did not take place   You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Crist	18.378631591796875
23554/28840	The valet bowed and retired and Albert returned to his	50.884193420410156
23555/28840	As he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his	68.52133178710938
23556/28840	He approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive	66.55455017089844
23557/28840	The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mothers room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the	55.92036819458008
23558/28840	As if the same idea had animated these two beings Mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in	33.060977935791016
23559/28840	Everything was in orderlaces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the	85.8270263671875
23560/28840	Albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming My mother he threw his arms around her	80.4382553100586
23561/28840	The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful	78.61309051513672
23562/28840	All these proofs of an energetic resolution which Albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his	52.331199645996094
23563/28840	Oh my mother exclaimed Albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and meyou cannot have made the same resolution I have for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house andand to	59.5893669128418
23564/28840	I also replied Mercédès am going and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me have I deceived myself   Mother said Albert with firm	48.9445686340332
23565/28840	I cannot make you share the fate I have planned for	61.43584060668945
23566/28840	I must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned	75.87471008300781
23567/28840	So my dear mother I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present	47.57691192626953
23568/28840	You my poor child suffer poverty and hunger Oh do not say so it will break my	139.91595458984375
23569/28840	I am young and strong I believe I am courageous and since yesterday I have learned the power of	29.75121307373047
23570/28840	No mother from this moment I have done with the past and accept nothing from itnot even a name because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before	54.47361373901367
23571/28840	Albert my child said Mercédès if I had a stronger heart that is the counsel I would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its	50.1424674987793
23572/28840	You had friends Albert break off their	933.9061889648438
23573/28840	But do not despair you have life before you my dear Albert for you are yet scarcely twentytwo years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fathersit was	73.259765625
23574/28840	I am sure my dear Albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name	69.64806365966797
23575/28840	Then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if I am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for I have no future to look forward	79.82845306396484
23576/28840	For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this	134.86663818359375
23577/28840	I will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young	21.570261001586914
23578/28840	Yes I share your hopes the anger of Heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and I am	78.63011169433594
23579/28840	But since our resolution is formed let us act	69.8605728149414
23580/28840	de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an	51.34285354614258
23581/28840	I am ready my son said Mercédè	12.461442947387695
23582/28840	He recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue des SaintsPères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the count	58.51435470581055
23583/28840	As the carriage stopped at the door and Albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a	23.70978355407715
23584/28840	Albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for Bertuccio but he was	42.506343841552734
23585/28840	He returned to Mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the	14.75625228881836
23586/28840	Mercédès read   AlbertWhile showing you that I have discovered your plans I hope also to convince you of my delic	32.17121124267578
23587/28840	You are free you leave the counts house and you take your mother to your home but reflect Albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay	86.7515640258789
23588/28840	I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking anything with	22.524219512939453
23589/28840	Do not seek to know how I discovered it I know itthat is	80.6091537475586
23590/28840	Twentyfour years ago I returned proud and joyful to my	210.53208923339844
23591/28840	I had a betrothed Albert a lovely girl whom I adored and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless to	30.230436325073242
23592/28840	This money was for her I destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles on the Allées de Meil	37.102821350097656
23593/28840	Your mother Albert knows that poor house	825.5809326171875
23594/28840	A short time since I passed through Marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my	38.376121520996094
23595/28840	The iron box was thereno one had touched itunder a beautiful figtree my father had planted the day I was born which overshadowed the	121.54537963867188
23596/28840	Well Albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same	99.54457092285156
23597/28840	Oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I	124.65239715576172
23598/28840	Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this	83.13076782226562
23599/28840	Mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards	10.3490571975708
23600/28840	I accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which I shall take with me to some convent   Putting the letter in her bosom she took her sons arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went	38.77713394165039
23601/28840	The Suicide   Meanwhile Monte Cristo had also returned to town with Emmanuel and Maximil	34.91093063354492
23602/28840	Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of	50.86997604370117
23603/28840	Morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brotherinlaws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his count	44.131465911865234
23604/28840	At the Barrière du Trône they met Bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his	28.793773651123047

23607/28840	If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said Morrel I would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to	80.7324447631836
23608/28840	So we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten	31.480804443359375
23609/28840	Stop a moment said Monte Cristo do not let me lose both my	35.130958557128906
23610/28840	Return Emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her and do you Morrel accompany me to the ChampsÉlysé	41.28924560546875

23612/28840	Shall we wait breakfast for you asked	210.98753356933594
23613/28840	The door was closed and the carriage	38.87299346923828
23614/28840	See what good fortune I brought you said Morrel when he was alone with the	41.420894622802734
23615/28840	Have you not thought so   Yes said Monte Cristo for that reason I wished to keep you near	26.135334014892578
23616/28840	It is miraculous continued Morrel answering his own	130.1436767578125
23617/28840	Yes said the Count you are rightit is	23.97987174987793
23618/28840	Very brave said Monte Cristo I have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his	40.015777587890625
23619/28840	And I know he has fought two duels said Mor	59.07170104980469
23620/28840	How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning   All owing to your influence replied Monte Cristo	58.751468658447266
23621/28840	It is well for Albert he is not in the army said Mor	40.08463668823242
23622/28840	Why   An apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his	16.50342559814453
23623/28840	Doubtless doubtless said Morrel but I shall say like the Spaniard He has not been so brave today as he was	85.44383239746094
23624/28840	You will breakfast with me will you not Morrel said the count to turn the	35.05730056762695

23628/28840	Oh said the count I only know two things which destroy the appetitegriefand as I am happy to see you very cheerful it is not thatand	52.11981201171875
23629/28840	Now after what you told me this morning of your heart I may believe   Well count replied Morrel gayly I will not dispute	27.576242446899414
23630/28840	But you will not make me your confidant Maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the	18.984649658203125
23631/28840	I showed you this morning that I had a heart did I not count Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young	25.197641372680664
23632/28840	Well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes it is elsewhere and I must go and find	31.04977798461914
23633/28840	Go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love and that I love you Mor	47.98967742919922
23634/28840	40260m       I will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their	26.59108543395996
23635/28840	When I need your assistance and the moment arrives I will come to you	47.388671875
23636/28840	Monte Cristo opened the carriagedoor Morrel sprang out on the pavement Bertuccio was waiting on the	34.35359573364258
23637/28840	Morrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertucc	24.378543853759766
23638/28840	She is going to leave her house said the stew	31.58673667907715
23639/28840	And her son   Florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the	25.46854591369629
23640/28840	Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the stew	28.3187198638916
23641/28840	But first let Haydée be informed that I have	82.239013671875
23642/28840	Here I am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return	37.54546356201172
23643/28840	Every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by Haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly	64.06839752197266
23644/28840	Doubtless although less evident Monte Cristos joy was not less	104.23624420166016
23645/28840	Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly	131.24179077148438
23646/28840	Monte Cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two Mercédès in the world and he might yet be	28.734594345092773
23647/28840	His eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of Haydée when suddenly the door	72.6333236694336
23648/28840	de Morcerf said Baptistin as if that name sufficed for his	48.79125213623047
23649/28840	Which asked he the viscount or the count   The	57.41838455200195
23650/28840	Oh exclaimed Haydée is it not yet over   I know not if it is finished my beloved child said Monte Cristo taking the young girls hands but I do know you have nothing more to	17.932523727416992
23651/28840	But it is the wretched   That man cannot injure me Haydée said Monte Cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to	28.88225555419922
23652/28840	And what I have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my	45.16765213012695
23653/28840	By my fathers tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl I swear to you Haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to	17.540332794189453
23654/28840	I believe you my lord as implicitly as if God had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to	40.41775131225586
23655/28840	Monte Cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other	138.72926330566406
23656/28840	Oh murmured the count shall I then be permitted to love again Ask	85.26605987548828
23657/28840	de Morcerf into the drawingroom said he to Baptistin while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private	28.345075607299805
23658/28840	We must explain this visit which although expected by Monte Cristo is unexpected to our	103.76720428466797
23659/28840	He who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in Madame de Morcerfs	49.38292694091797
23660/28840	From that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the	56.381771087646484
23661/28840	He remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own	54.78403854370117
23662/28840	For him those ten minutes were very	470.8861389160156
23663/28840	It was then Albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned	76.11067962646484
23664/28840	The counts eye expanded he knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly	82.8246841430664
23665/28840	Albert returned safelythen the count was reven	172.84121704101562
23666/28840	An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a	59.47011947631836
23667/28840	But as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his	46.277076721191406
23668/28840	Ten minutes afterwards General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black	35.68015670776367
23669/28840	He had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coachhouse ready for	78.4261474609375
23670/28840	The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coach	38.74520492553711
23671/28840	The coachman stooped down for his	55.0830192565918
23672/28840	To the ChampsÉlysées said the general the Count of Monte Crist	8.758354187011719
23673/28840	Hurry   The horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the counts	45.365150451660156
23674/28840	de Morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his	44.360260009765625
23675/28840	A moment afterwards Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo and the latter leading Haydée aside ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawing	30.56131362915039
23676/28840	The general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived Monte Cristo at the	41.422821044921875
23677/28840	de Morcerf said Monte Cristo quietly I thought I had not heard ar	14.654576301574707
23678/28840	Yes it is I said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating	37.50086212158203
23679/28840	May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing	37.67673110961914
23680/28840	de Morcerf so early   Had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the	37.43574523925781
23681/28840	And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill	40.27129364013672
23682/28840	Yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even	41.91770935058594
23683/28840	Yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my	49.45094299316406
23684/28840	It is true sir said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the	37.59397888183594
23685/28840	Doubtless you made then some apology or explanation   I explained nothing and it is he who apologized to	67.65926361083984
23686/28840	But to what do you attribute this conduct   To the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than	61.092384338378906
23687/28840	And who was that   His	66.21199035644531
23688/28840	That may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves	49.853973388671875
23689/28840	I know it and I expected this	69.11351013183594
23690/28840	You expected my son would be a coward cried the	62.60248947143555
23691/28840	Albert de Morcerf is no coward said Monte Crist	15.935768127441406
23692/28840	Albert that and he may know what to answer	133.34255981445312
23693/28840	Oh no no said the general smiling faintly I did not come for that purpose you are	45.65991973876953
23694/28840	I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my	24.899152755737305
23695/28840	I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively that it seems as if I had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do	32.414146423339844
23696/28840	Do you think so sir  	27.305421829223633
23697/28840	And when I told you I had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit I alluded	30.21968650817871
23698/28840	Are you prepared   Yes	42.58567810058594
23699/28840	You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with	68.53170013427734
23700/28840	40262m       Until one of us dies repeated Monte Cristo moving his head slightly up and	18.52778434753418
23701/28840	Let us start then we need no	372.8450927734375
23702/28840	Very true said Monte Cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well   On the contrary said the count we know so little of each	25.26191520690918
23703/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us	21.186840057373047
23704/28840	I know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch I know not every page of my life but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous cover	54.56665802001953
23705/28840	Nono I am aware you know me but I know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jew	44.86323547363281
23706/28840	You call yourself in Paris the Count of Monte Cristo in Italy Sinbad the Sailor in Malta I forget	31.298810958862305
23707/28840	But it is your real name I want to know in the midst of your hundred names that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when I plunge my sword through your	43.565155029296875
23708/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring	33.27561569213867
23709/28840	He leaped towards a dressingroom near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black	36.48362731933594
23710/28840	The fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness	63.12063217163086
23711/28840	He stopped at a short distance from the house and alight	17.489749908447266
23712/28840	The door was wide open a hackneycoach was standing in the middle of the yarda strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his	52.77894592285156
23713/28840	Two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid	95.1788330078125
23714/28840	It was Mercédès leaning on her sons arm and leaving the	14.65268611907959
23715/28840	The general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and	36.036067962646484
23716/28840	He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the	35.629478454589844
23717/28840	And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the	30.834484100341797
23718/28840	Valentine   We may easily conceive where Morrels appointment	25.323078155517578
23719/28840	He knew his time wellthe hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious	81.90042877197266
23720/28840	Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that	36.20470428466797
23721/28840	Uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her	42.967002868652344
23722/28840	This uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report Morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the Opera was generally	47.05647277832031
23723/28840	No one at Villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from	81.7582015991211
23724/28840	Valentine with her womans instinct guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to	31.235939025878906
23725/28840	We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was	63.824153900146484
23726/28840	Now said Valentine motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own	25.87283706665039
23727/28840	You know Maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an apartment away from	75.46189880371094
23728/28840	Yes said Maximilian I recollect the project of which I highly	21.305213928222656
23729/28840	Well said Valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of	55.57007598876953
23730/28840	40272m       And do you know said Valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this	22.576688766479492
23731/28840	Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for Mor	47.791542053222656
23732/28840	Noirtiers reason answered Morrel I can readily believe it to be a good	41.63509750366211
23733/28840	He pretends the air of the Faubourg SaintHonoré is not good for	15.256020545959473
23734/28840	Noirtier may be right you have not seemed to be well for the last	66.85159301757812
23735/28840	And grandpapa has become my physician and I have the greatest confidence in him because he knows	25.832624435424805
23736/28840	Do you then really suffer asked Morrel	120.03319549560547
23737/28840	Oh it must not be called suffering I feel a general uneasiness that is	45.704856872558594
23738/28840	I have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to	52.9682502746582
23739/28840	Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine	20.677799224853516
23740/28840	And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint   A very simple one said	53.689632415771484
23741/28840	I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my	81.62739562988281
23742/28840	When I say one spoonful I began by onenow I take	275.8735656738281
23743/28840	Valentine smiled but it was evident that she	23.205551147460938
23744/28840	Maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at	71.40178680419922
23745/28840	She was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish	36.419166564941406
23746/28840	From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirt	38.373165130615234
23747/28840	The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like Morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the	49.54836654663086
23748/28840	But said Morrel I thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for	58.83161163330078
23749/28840	Noirtier   I know it is very bitter said Valentine so bitter that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same	63.40911865234375
23750/28840	Yes grandpapa said Valentine it is	18.74280548095703
23751/28840	Just now before I came down to you I drank a glass of sugared water I left half because it seemed so	149.58444213867188
23752/28840	Noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to	13.882413864135742
23753/28840	In fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming	103.3547134399414
23754/28840	Oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular I cant see Did the sun shine in my eyes And she leaned against the	94.39555358886719
23755/28840	The sun is not shining said Morrel more alarmed by Noirtiers expression than by Valentines indis	58.030616760253906
23756/28840	Do not be alarmed Maximilian it is nothing and has already passed	50.04574966430664
23757/28840	But listen Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard She opened Noirtiers door ran to a window in the passage and returned	63.327171325683594
23758/28840	Yes said she it is Madame Danglars and her daughter who have come to call on	11.897932052612305
23759/28840	GoodbyeI must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till I see you	122.40689086914062
23760/28840	Stay with grandpapa Maximilian I promise you not to persuade them to	34.61122512817383
23761/28840	40274m       Morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villeforts apartments and to	16.755523681640625
23762/28840	As soon as she was gone Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the	21.658226013183594
23763/28840	Morrel obeyed guided by Valentine he had learned how to understand the old man	49.707889556884766
23764/28840	Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barroiss situation and in Noirtiers name gave that	56.92332077026367
23765/28840	The decanter and the glass were completely	66.89244079589844
23766/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he wished to	9.627541542053223
23767/28840	Why are the glass and decanter empty asked he Valentine said she only drank half the glass	200.82186889648438
23768/28840	The translation of this new question occupied another five	520.0933227539062
23769/28840	I do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentines room perhaps she has emptied	21.311580657958984
23770/28840	Ask her said Morrel translating Noirtiers thought this time by his	50.410194396972656
23771/28840	The servant went out but returned almost	86.27295684814453
23772/28840	Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his	41.42383575439453
23773/28840	Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one	65.22785186767578
23774/28840	From that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit	18.788009643554688
23775/28840	It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen they had been ushered into Madame de Villeforts room who had said she would receive them	20.40883445739746
23776/28840	That is why Valentine passed through her room which was on a level with Valentines and only separated from it by	73.98406219482422
23777/28840	The two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal	57.22737503051758
23778/28840	Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemn	27.785667419433594
23779/28840	Valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were	42.857879638671875
23780/28840	My dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalc	25.16469955444336
23781/28840	Danglars kept up the title of	19.922061920166016

23807/28840	Deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the	50.12466049194336
23808/28840	She would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly Madame Danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her letharg	31.414255142211914

23836/28840	The cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtiers lips seemed to start from his	32.32001876831055
23837/28840	Morrel understood it he knew he must call	120.67930603027344

23862/28840	The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in	43.765235900878906

23888/28840	This is a gloomy introduction if I may judge from your pallor and shuddering Mor	51.264896392822266

23891/28840	The former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of Gods	91.51656341552734
23892/28840	Ah indeed said Monte Cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilians	24.261260986328125
23893/28840	Yes continued Morrel death had entered that house twice within one	121.02540588378906
23894/28840	And what did the doctor answer asked Monte Crist	32.15360641479492

23897/28840	Well said Maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a	45.272544860839844
23898/28840	Death is now perhaps striking a fourth	168.7513885498047

23935/28840	He stopped one moment at the door for Baptistin whom he saw in the Rue Matignon and who was	23.857585906982422
23936/28840	Villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the	29.748035430908203
23937/28840	Noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than Villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affection	30.525646209716797
23938/28840	At last dAvrigny slowly uttered these words She is still alive   Still cried Villefort oh doctor what a dreadful word is	32.14476013183594
23939/28840	Yes said the physician I repeat it she is still alive and I am astonished at	35.78959274291992
23940/28840	But is she safe asked the	289.1263732910156
23941/28840	At that moment dAvrignys glance met Noirtiers	39.487064361572266
23942/28840	It glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was	64.75092315673828
23943/28840	He placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole faceand remained motionless looking at Noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he	49.23947525024414
23944/28840	Sir said dAvrigny to Villefort call Mademoiselle Valentines maid if you	10.505094528198242
23945/28840	Villefort went himself to find her and dAvrigny approached Noirt	17.517972946166992
23946/28840	Have you something to tell me asked	80.73382568359375
23947/28840	The old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his	100.25189971923828
23948/28840	At this moment Villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came Madame de Ville	24.247041702270508
23949/28840	What is the matter then with this dear child she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but I did not think seriously of	27.39583969116211
23950/28840	The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached Valentine and took her	32.87244415283203
23951/28840	DAvrigny continued to look at Noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his	49.82524108886719
23952/28840	Ah said he involuntarily following Noirtiers eyes which were fixed on Madame de Villefort who repeated   This poor child would be better in	25.125993728637695
23953/28840	Come Fanny we will put her to	156.15914916992188
23954/28840	dAvrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with Noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he	40.371002197265625
23955/28840	They carried Valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the	185.46267700195312
23956/28840	She had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very	92.1337661743164
23957/28840	DAvrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters	88.45208740234375
23958/28840	We have no time to lose I will question and do you answer	56.12173080444336
23959/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to	10.441783905029297
23960/28840	Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter  	48.14362335205078
23961/28840	DAvrigny reflected a moment then approaching Noirtier   Pardon what I am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible	69.31149291992188
23962/28840	Did you see poor Barrois die Noirtier raised his eyes to	18.49628448486328
23963/28840	Do you know of what he died asked dAvrigny placing his hand on Noirtiers	12.885190963745117
23964/28840	Do you think he died a natural death A sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of Noirt	56.43438720703125
23965/28840	Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned  	24.80704116821289
23966/28840	Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him  	107.94851684570312
23967/28840	Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now attacked Valentine  	48.2846794128418
23968/28840	Then will she die too asked dAvrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on Noirt	18.50075340270996
23969/28840	He watched the effect of this question on the old	56.28421401977539
23970/28840	No replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever div	28.9036922454834
23971/28840	Then you hope said dAvrigny with	23.22334098815918
23972/28840	What do you hope The old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not	28.664445877075195
23973/28840	Ah yes it is true murmured dAvrign	10.341877937316895
23974/28840	Then turning to NoirtierDo you hope the assassin will be tried  	50.16618347167969
23975/28840	Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine  	79.53216552734375
23976/28840	It is no news to you added dAvrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the	27.136001586914062
23977/28840	Then how do you hope Valentine will escape   Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same	19.57600212097168
23978/28840	DAvrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every	165.0256805419922
23979/28840	Ah indeed said dAvrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to youNoirtier did not let him	45.85580062866211
23980/28840	To prepare her system to resist poison  	138.2169952392578
23981/28840	By accustoming her by degrees   Yes yes yes said Noirtier delighted to be	31.42432975769043
23982/28840	I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give	24.24066734313965
23983/28840	And by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison Noirtiers joy	38.45222854614258
23984/28840	Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance could have been proc	150.6729278564453
23985/28840	The dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate Valentine will not	49.902610778808594
23986/28840	A superhuman joy expanded the old mans eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite	29.453842163085938
23987/28840	Here doctor said he is what you sent me	103.24087524414062
23988/28840	Was this prepared in your presence   Yes replied the procure	32.65575408935547
23989/28840	Have you not let it go out of your hands  	32.95125961303711
23990/28840	DAvrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed	105.8675308227539
23991/28840	Well said he let us go to Valentine I will give instructions to everyone and you	48.42022705078125
23992/28840	de Villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from	55.46159744262695
23993/28840	40294m       At the moment when dAvrigny was returning to Valentines room accompanied by Villefort an Italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of	32.807865142822266
23994/28840	No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left	118.14549255371094
23995/28840	About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o	64.1550064086914
23996/28840	The lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in	49.89149856567383
23997/28840	This new tenant who as we have said was an Italian was called Il Signor Giacomo Bus	35.94309997558594
23998/28840	Workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering	59.30358123779297
23999/28840	This formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be	60.52883529663086
24000/28840	We beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner Baron Dangl	55.53611755371094
24001/28840	In this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every	41.8917350769043
24002/28840	When his patience was exhausted he called his val	63.863792419433594
24003/28840	Étienne said he see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawingroom and why she makes me wait so	25.28075408935547
24004/28840	Having given this vent to his illhumor the baron became more calm Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawingroom as the	34.63983154296875
24005/28840	The singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing	87.63627624511719
24006/28840	Mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here	35.19508361816406
24007/28840	Danglars nodded to signify that he was	22.73838996887207
24008/28840	To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the goodnatured man and the indulgent	30.36941909790039
24009/28840	Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering	101.38373565673828
24010/28840	I will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least	63.06103515625
24011/28840	I have chosen the drawingroom sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankers	51.855133056640625
24012/28840	I have therefore chosen this drawingroom where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastor	71.92811584472656
24013/28840	I rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but I should be no artist if I had not some f	84.3893814086914
24014/28840	There is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said Eugénie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the	106.37456512451172
24015/28840	Now let us return to the	29.95260238647461
24016/28840	You ask me why I have requested this interview I will tell you in two words sir I will not marry count Andrea Cavalc	42.68893051147461
24017/28840	Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards	10.070586204528809
24018/28840	However this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice	76.80377197265625
24019/28840	Well sir replied Eugénie I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is	25.519521713256836
24020/28840	Well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no	48.513999938964844
24021/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his	86.89195251464844
24022/28840	It is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which I consider quite beneath	75.35733795166016
24023/28840	I actually love no one sir you know it do you not I do not then see why without real necessity I should encumber my life with a perpetual	91.0953369140625
24024/28840	Has not some sage said Nothing too much and another I carry all my effects with me I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in Greek one is I believe from Phædrus and the other from B	110.06475830078125
24025/28840	Well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesI cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and I remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly	69.44071197509766
24026/28840	Unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured Danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly	56.36750030517578
24027/28840	Unhappy girl replied Eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir No indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and	70.31535339355469
24028/28840	Happy on the contrary for what am I in want of The world calls me	114.59581756591797
24029/28840	It is something to be well	80.90631866455078
24030/28840	I like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so	102.4195327758789
24031/28840	I possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all I meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its	72.08203887939453
24032/28840	I am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in	35.4224853515625

24034/28840	Besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur	45.77397537231445
24035/28840	Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute	60.731407165527344
24036/28840	Truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing I will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess	82.75287628173828
24037/28840	Eugénie looked at Danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be	32.48177719116211
24038/28840	My daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall	65.38214874267578
24039/28840	Eugénie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a	51.17421340942383
24040/28840	My daughter continued Danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to	59.107852935791016
24041/28840	Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their	115.1981430053711
24042/28840	This is not my weakness I tell you at once family joys have no charm for	113.6933364868164
24043/28840	I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a	58.040523529052734
24044/28840	This is not to the purpose said Eugénie let us speak candidly sir I admire cand	30.502946853637695
24045/28840	Oh said Danglars I can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general	86.2393569946289
24046/28840	40302m       It is just as I tell you I assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this	22.339019775390625
24047/28840	I do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and	47.54684066772461
24048/28840	But in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not	62.87886047363281
24049/28840	There one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility I will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and	65.08654022216797
24050/28840	de Monte Cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which I have never	25.38633918762207
24051/28840	There we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his	76.30225372314453
24052/28840	But Eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the	82.40714263916016
24053/28840	Exactly my daughter that is precisely what I mean said Danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruinedyes that is	40.07200241088867
24054/28840	Yes ruined Now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet	101.3885269165039
24055/28840	Now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect	121.0422592163086
24056/28840	Oh cried Eugénie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn	33.31605529785156
24057/28840	Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars Undeceive yourself again either I am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which will pass over without affecting	48.47430419921875
24058/28840	She has taken care for herselfat least I hope sofor her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over	64.98563385009766
24059/28840	She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for	104.3248519897461
24060/28840	Oh no sir from my childhood I have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over	75.47338104248047

24063/28840	So much the better I have a ray of hope left	122.42784881591797
24064/28840	I am all attention said Eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting	27.296159744262695
24065/28840	Cavalcanti continued Danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million liv	58.52885818481445
24066/28840	That is admirable said Eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the	34.0804443359375
24067/28840	You think I shall deprive you of those three millions said Danglars but do not fear	17.892353057861328
24068/28840	They are destined to produce at least	78.10787963867188
24069/28840	I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians in the fantastic Mississippi	82.67789459228516
24070/28840	As I look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the	42.13295364379883
24071/28840	We make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our	75.14118957519531

24078/28840	I am willing to help rebuild your fortune but I will not be an accomplice in the ruin of	30.378419876098633
24079/28840	But since I tell you cried Danglars that with these three million   Do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million   I hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my	35.96719741821289
24080/28840	Shall you be able to pay	80.64871215820312
24081/28840	Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry   He shall receive them on returning from the mayors	57.222354888916016
24082/28840	Very well   What next what more do you want   I wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person  	45.862831115722656
24083/28840	Then as I said before sirvery well I am ready to marry	72.70504760742188
24084/28840	But what are you up to   Ah that is my	45.78538131713867
24085/28840	What advantage should I have over you if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine   Danglars bit his	35.40376663208008
24086/28840	Then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable   Yes replied Eugé	26.46295738220215
24087/28840	And to sign the contract in three days  	27.636558532714844
24088/28840	Then in my turn I also say very well   Danglars pressed his daughters hand in	17.43364906311035
24089/28840	But extraordinary to relate the father did not say Thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her	112.09428405761719
24090/28840	Is the conference ended asked Eugénie	89.65887451171875
24091/28840	Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to	9.86021900177002
24092/28840	Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle dArmillys fingers and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantios malediction on Desdem	30.104267120361328
24093/28840	At the end of the piece Étienne entered and announced to Eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her	18.646095275878906
24094/28840	We have seen them at Villeforts they proceeded then on their	66.23841857910156
24095/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a	60.63993835449219
24096/28840	He inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the	51.793338775634766
24097/28840	The count stopped on seeing the young	59.55548095703125
24098/28840	As for Andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped	68.24879455566406
24099/28840	Ah good morning my dear count said	94.89993286132812
24100/28840	Andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do   Charmingly as you	46.795989990234375
24101/28840	I am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned   I was going out	38.65132522583008
24102/28840	Then in order not to hinder you I will get up with you if you please in your carriage and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in	46.421138763427734
24103/28840	No said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young mans societyno I prefer listening to you here my dear	21.767351150512695
24104/28840	Andrea we can chat better indoors and there is no coachman to overhear our	88.75318908691406
24105/28840	The count returned to a small drawingroom on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat	28.386619567871094
24106/28840	You know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this	44.10198211669922
24107/28840	At nine oclock the contract is to be signed at my fatherin	39.69150161743164
24108/28840	What is it news to you Has not	94.21666717529297
24109/28840	Danglars informed you of the ceremony   Oh yes said the count I received a letter from him yesterday but I do not think the hour was	18.179777145385742
24110/28840	Possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general	334.9723205566406
24111/28840	Well said Monte Cristo you are fortunate	15.107223510742188
24112/28840	Cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome	27.111093521118164
24113/28840	Yes indeed she is replied Cavalcanti in a very modest	41.15437316894531
24114/28840	Above all she is very richat least I believe so said Monte Crist	39.113433837890625
24115/28840	Very rich do you think replied the young	53.02109146118164
24116/28840	Danglars conceals at least half of his	18.467021942138672
24117/28840	And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said Andrea with a look sparkling with	51.793426513671875
24118/28840	Without reckoning added Monte Cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England but quite novel in	32.80974197387695
24119/28840	Yes yes I know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not   Precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that	34.90202713012695
24120/28840	Ten millions Do you think so It is magnificent said Cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden	37.109622955322266
24121/28840	Without reckoning replied Monte Cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only	28.98508644104004
24122/28840	Besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrot	36.822601318359375
24123/28840	Andrea I think you have managed this affair rather skilfully   Not badly by any means said the young man I was born for a diplomat	54.89936447143555
24124/28840	Well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinct	39.0494499206543
24125/28840	Have you lost your heart   Indeed I fear it replied Andrea in the tone in which he had heard Dorante or Valère reply to Alceste21 at the Théâtre Franç	27.0550594329834
24126/28840	Is your love returned   I suppose so said Andrea with a triumphant smile since I am	72.82527160644531
24127/28840	But I must not forget one grand	207.9487762451172
24128/28840	Which   That I have been singularly	35.46952438354492
24129/28840	By circumstances   No by	132.21078491210938
24130/28840	By me Not at all prince said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have I done for you Are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient   No said Andreano it is useless for you to say so	46.61568832397461
24131/28840	I maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my	65.6811294555664
24132/28840	What encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers name so well known in Italy and so highly	68.99703979492188
24133/28840	This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken	66.04574584960938
24134/28840	Oh then my father has really a very large fortune count   It appears so sir replied Monte Crist	34.031280517578125
24135/28840	Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come   I have been advised of	52.669395446777344
24136/28840	But the three millions   The three millions are probably on the	49.43357849121094
24137/28840	Then I shall really have them   Oh well said the count I do not think you have yet known the want of	29.778060913085938
24138/28840	Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a	99.35203552246094
24139/28840	Then arousing from his reverie   Now sir I have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to	32.525856018066406
24140/28840	I have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of	62.3567008972168
24141/28840	I understand well I am come to ask a favor of	34.95722961425781
24142/28840	Of me   Yes of	50.25420379638672
24143/28840	And pray what may it be   Well to take his	62.219268798828125
24144/28840	I who have a seraglio at Cairo one at Smyrna and one at Constantinople preside at a weddingnever   Then you refuse me   Decidedly and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same	31.592756271362305
24145/28840	But what must be done said Andrea	72.26074981689453
24146/28840	You said just now that you had a hundred	59.44236755371094
24147/28840	Very true but you introduced me at	192.20582580566406
24148/28840	Not at all Let us recall the exact	111.61298370361328
24149/28840	You met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different	82.20114135742188
24150/28840	Yes but by my marriage you have forwarded	73.94734954833984
24151/28840	Inot in the least I beg you to	128.9698486328125
24152/28840	Recollect what I told you when you asked me to propose	47.19318389892578
24153/28840	Oh I never make matches my dear prince it is my settled	150.24246215820312
24154/28840	50025m       But at least you will be there   Will all Paris be there   Oh	14.765299797058105
24155/28840	Well like all Paris I shall be there too said the	41.41237258911133
24156/28840	And will you sign the contract   I see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus	37.04532241821289
24157/28840	Well since you will grant me no more I must be content with what you give	31.84018898010254
24158/28840	Be careful advice is worse than a	235.36495971679688
24159/28840	Oh you can give me this without compromising	56.303863525390625
24160/28840	Is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres   That is the sum	29.653913497924805
24161/28840	Because said Andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness I thought I heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just	28.30565071105957
24162/28840	Well replied Monte Cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve	48.82977294921875
24163/28840	Baron Danglars is a good father and knows how to	64.27092742919922
24164/28840	In that case said Andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves	71.80574035644531
24165/28840	You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar	130.002197265625
24166/28840	Well said Andrea let it be as you	31.469938278198242
24167/28840	Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile Andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and	54.378719329833984
24168/28840	An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing	29.541444778442383
24169/28840	Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single	24.616731643676758
24170/28840	Her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest	117.30531311035156
24171/28840	Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	11.64128589630127
24172/28840	Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular	56.132511138916016
24173/28840	Danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the	73.5995101928711
24174/28840	The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and	61.19352340698242
24175/28840	As usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most	102.0314712524414

24177/28840	At each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different	62.94227981567383
24178/28840	The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his	38.26800537109375
24179/28840	His only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waist	39.45182418823242
24180/28840	A circle was immediately formed around the	258.20501708984375
24181/28840	The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawingroom	34.97195053100586
24182/28840	Danglars at the other and Eugénie in front of	17.19900894165039
24183/28840	Near her was Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy which she intended immediately to make use	31.25729751586914
24184/28840	On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars who had advanced to meet	35.27574920654297
24185/28840	Having accomplished these three social duties Monte Cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say I have done my duty now let others do	61.817386627197266
24186/28840	Andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the	34.165428161621094
24187/28840	He found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weight	113.55712890625
24188/28840	The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions	44.441097259521484
24189/28840	One of the notaries sat down the other remained	53.485504150390625
24190/28840	They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half Paris assembled was to	54.48225021362305
24191/28840	All took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the _style énergique_ commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea on	63.939083099365234
24192/28840	Danglars riveted attention Eugénies composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important	30.100112915039062
24193/28840	The contract was read during a profound	227.0718994140625
24194/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in spl	27.403894424438477
24195/28840	As for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without	47.42634201049805
24196/28840	Andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewild	117.3984375
24197/28840	The notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said   Gentlemen we are about to sign the	30.15545082092285
24198/28840	The baron was to sign first then the representative of	108.6603775024414
24199/28840	Cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal	78.42939758300781
24200/28840	The baron took the pen and signed then the	58.507850646972656
24201/28840	The baroness approached leaning on Madame de Villeforts	19.277448654174805
24202/28840	My dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious An unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing	50.827945709228516
24203/28840	Danglars in the same tone in which he would have said Oh well what do I care   As a matter of fact said Monte Cristo approaching I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his	23.733243942260742
24204/28840	What you count said Madame Danglars signing if you are take care for I shall never forgive	23.055892944335938
24205/28840	But it is not my fault as I shall endeavor to	21.809791564941406
24206/28840	Everyone listened eagerly Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to	59.89823532104492
24207/28840	You remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave	40.85042190551758
24208/28840	In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they	36.67288589477539
24209/28840	Andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming	102.71170806884766
24210/28840	Well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the	102.09454345703125
24211/28840	The ladies screamed and two or three prepared to	263.68511962890625
24212/28840	No one could guess what the dirty rag could be I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered	49.40896987915039
24213/28840	My valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you bar	47.842376708984375
24214/28840	Yes indeed to you I succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied Monte Cristo amid the general outburst of amaz	50.041683197021484
24215/28840	But asked Madame Danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent	14.834856033325195
24216/28840	de Villefort   In this simple way madame replied Monte Cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence I therefore sent them to the kings	27.589801788330078
24217/28840	You understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against	58.35230255126953
24218/28840	Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawing	61.52566146850586
24219/28840	Possibly said Danglars was not this murdered man an old galleyslave   50025m       Yes replied the count a felon named Cader	20.053817749023438
24220/28840	Danglars turned slightly pale Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing	35.394737243652344
24221/28840	But go on signing said Monte Cristo I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and I beg to apologize to you baroness and to Mademoiselle Dangl	18.860565185546875
24222/28840	The baroness who had signed returned the pen to the not	44.53536605834961
24223/28840	Prince Cavalcanti said the latter Prince Cavalcanti where are you   Andrea Andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian	31.67280387878418
24224/28840	Call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried Danglars to one of the floor	52.40939712524414
24225/28840	But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments _quærens quem devoret	73.01400756835938

24275/28840	There now said Eugénie while I change my costume do you lock the portmante	58.667930603027344
24276/28840	Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmante	41.3515739440918

24278/28840	When this was done Eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling	49.177879333496094
24279/28840	Here said she you see I have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be	68.73197937011719

24284/28840	Then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony	38.12445068359375
24285/28840	50039m       Oh the magnificent hair said Louise with	35.9240608215332

24292/28840	And the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their	74.59199523925781
24293/28840	The yard was empty the clock was striking	825.5687255859375
24294/28840	The porter was not yet gone to	27.061199188232422
24295/28840	Eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his	34.66530990600586
24296/28840	She returned to Louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the	20.245540618896484
24297/28840	Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one	46.053287506103516
24298/28840	Then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard   Gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the	98.56228637695312
24299/28840	The porter got up as Eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it	63.392189025878906
24300/28840	Louise slid through the halfopen gate like a snake and bounded lightly	194.3314208984375
24301/28840	Eugénie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her	37.58713150024414
24302/28840	A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to	29.152647018432617
24303/28840	36 Rue de la Victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted	114.51704406738281
24304/28840	As for Eugénie she was as strong as a Judith or a Delil	40.51905822753906
24305/28840	Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him	22.737794876098633
24306/28840	The shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to	32.60421371459961
24307/28840	Mademoiselle said Eugénie let the porter get the postchaise from the coachhouse and fetch some posthorses from the	12.936973571777344
24308/28840	Here are five francs for his	239.8026885986328
24309/28840	Indeed said Louise I admire you and I could almost say respect	78.8039321899414
24310/28840	The laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no	59.02867889404297
24311/28840	In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a postboy and horses which were harnessed and put in the postchaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and	21.057477951049805
24312/28840	Here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman   To Fontainebleau replied Eugénie with an almost masculine	33.26175308227539
24313/28840	I am giving them the slip said Eugénie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our	68.09292602539062
24314/28840	And the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the	49.98673629760742
24315/28840	You are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her	44.66785430908203
24316/28840	A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the Barrière Saint	29.389028549194336
24317/28840	Ah said Louise breathing freely here we are out of	48.966922760009766
24318/28840	Yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied Eugé	49.20528030395508
24319/28840	I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied Eugé	80.71061706542969
24320/28840	These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of La Vil	71.08517456054688
24321/28840	The Bell and Bottle Tavern   And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their way to Brussels and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to	34.65074920654297
24322/28840	Notwithstanding his youth Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent	173.70237731933594
24323/28840	We have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last	30.174753189086914
24324/28840	But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the _trousseau_ of the brideelect was on	56.997772216796875
24325/28840	There were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls Valenciennes lace English veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the _corbeille	59.611934661865234
24326/28840	22 Now in passing through this room Andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before	47.50640869140625
24327/28840	Furnished with this plunder Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarm	57.848087310791016
24328/28840	Having passed through the Rue du MontBlanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the Rue La F	39.928775787353516
24329/28840	He was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the SaintLazare on the other Paris enshrouded in	54.66376876831055
24330/28840	Am I to be captured he cried no not if I can use more activity than my	178.91342163085938
24331/28840	My safety is now a mere question of	149.3555908203125
24332/28840	At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonni	16.79599952697754
24333/28840	The dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg SaintDenis where no doubt he ordinarily had his	53.76544952392578
24334/28840	What do you want sir asked the	44.114444732666016
24335/28840	Is your horse tired   Tired oh yes tired enoughhe has done nothing the whole of this blessed day Four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that I have earned and I ought to take ten to the	101.19315338134766
24336/28840	Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have   With pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be	57.820892333984375
24337/28840	Tell me what I am to do for	36.01692199707031

24339/28840	I tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to	154.97479248046875
24340/28840	Ah I know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over	213.9752655029297
24341/28840	Exactly so I merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom I am going to hunt tomorrow at ChapelleenServ	23.055448532104492
24342/28840	He should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till halfpast eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone	46.959022521972656
24343/28840	Well will you try and overtake him   Nothing I should like	37.607418060302734
24344/28840	If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before Louvres	63.32768249511719
24345/28840	And if we do overtake him   Forty said Andrea after a moments hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely	22.68452262878418
24346/28840	Everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the	44.323429107666016
24347/28840	Once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two posth	60.65489196777344
24348/28840	Ah said Cavalcanti to himself if I only had that britzka those two good posthorses and above all the passport that carries them on And he sighed	49.71604537963867
24349/28840	The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle dArm	4.23568868637085
24350/28840	Hurry hurry said Andrea we must overtake him	787.534912109375
24351/28840	And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at Louv	90.10074615478516
24352/28840	Certainly said Andrea I shall not overtake my friend but I shall kill your horse therefore I had better	47.467529296875
24353/28840	Here are thirty francs I will sleep at the _Cheval Rouge_ and will secure a place in the first	38.4309196472168
24354/28840	And Andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the	40.67539596557617
24355/28840	The cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to	116.2120361328125
24356/28840	Then he rested he must be near ChapelleenServal where he pretended to be	39.459922790527344
24357/28840	It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some	130.3301544189453
24358/28840	It would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was	107.62760162353516
24359/28840	It was still more impossible to remain in the department of the Oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in France this was quite out of the question especially to a man like Andrea perfectly conversant with criminal	72.45306396484375
24360/28840	He sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and	22.172908782958984
24361/28840	Ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was	67.2238998413086
24362/28840	He threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to ChapelleenServal he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the	47.02574157714844
24363/28840	My friend said Andrea I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw	80.36835479736328
24364/28840	I must reach Compiègne tonight or I shall cause deep anxiety to my	41.85908889770508
24365/28840	Could you let me hire a horse of you   An innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or	73.54766082763672
24366/28840	The host called the stableboy and ordered him to saddle _Le Blanc_ then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the	49.24198532104492
24367/28840	Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting	149.9495849609375
24368/28840	There is an excellent tavern at Compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been	30.072458267211914
24369/28840	My friend said Andrea I have been dining at SaintJeanauxBois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool I have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the	57.370460510253906
24370/28840	Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Borde	44.93741226196289
24371/28840	While the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose Andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have	105.3354263305664
24372/28840	3 which he had occupied on his last stay at Compièg	26.8075008392334
24373/28840	3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his	28.49276351928711
24374/28840	Andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that	194.29603576660156
24375/28840	7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as	146.3553009033203

24377/28840	The fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had	153.5770721435547
24378/28840	Then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with	55.545570373535156
24379/28840	Now here we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did	60.3185920715332
24380/28840	This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his	47.90204620361328
24381/28840	Moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misad	58.38093948364258
24382/28840	These were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused Andrea to sleep so sound	127.09022521972656
24383/28840	In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and longpointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from	49.95412826538086
24384/28840	About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his	55.115203857421875
24385/28840	In all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the	96.15828704833984
24386/28840	Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too	58.6424446105957
24387/28840	He jumped out of bed and ran to the	27.556793212890625
24388/28840	A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very	49.26163101196289
24389/28840	Why is that gendarme there asked Andrea of	90.89462280273438
24390/28840	Then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress	79.82331085205078
24391/28840	And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in	57.325260162353516
24392/28840	Now then said Andrea while dressing himself Ill wait till he leaves and then Ill slip	109.39476013183594
24393/28840	50047m       And saying this Andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin	37.619651794433594
24394/28840	The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the	45.7292594909668
24395/28840	Theyre after me was Andreas first	1391.1903076171875

24397/28840	His room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of	89.84599304199219
24398/28840	I am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in Andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or	172.6920166015625
24399/28840	He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and	38.59105682373047
24400/28840	With forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper   I have no money to pay my bill but I am not a dishonest man I leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the	53.947818756103516

24402/28840	He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the	26.505191802978516
24403/28840	At this precise time the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the	30.236528396606445
24404/28840	Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following	376.8357849121094
24405/28840	At daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of Cader	52.24538040161133
24406/28840	Now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville which is next door to the Bell and Bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the	34.962581634521484
24407/28840	The sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before	28.69194221496582
24408/28840	The young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his	28.96697998046875
24409/28840	This late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than Andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his	62.55208969116211
24410/28840	Oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open I would rather find it triply	69.95110321044922
24411/28840	And indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad	103.22857666015625
24412/28840	We say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single	98.69420623779297
24413/28840	He glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chim	64.4339599609375
24414/28840	Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious	64.53081512451172
24415/28840	The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to	86.20555877685547
24416/28840	The fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they	110.3326416015625
24417/28840	If once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another	75.30449676513672
24418/28840	He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by	64.45943450927734
24419/28840	At the same minute one of the little windows of the Hôtel de Ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme	18.328527450561523
24420/28840	For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head	69.08902740478516
24421/28840	The brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the	47.98176193237305
24422/28840	Well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the VillersCoterets and Noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no	78.87059020996094
24423/28840	The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the	62.318626403808594

24436/28840	The brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the	46.76231002807617
24437/28840	This is what had happened Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he	58.45132827758789
24438/28840	It would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was	141.6953125

24461/28840	The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering	62.664310455322266
24462/28840	Eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the	22.05751609802246
24463/28840	The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre at	29.277376174926758

24470/28840	The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of Eugé	48.202484130859375
24471/28840	She was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal	111.88164520263672
24472/28840	She listened at Eugénies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in	87.9952163696289
24473/28840	Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to	19.15643310546875
24474/28840	She called the maid and questioned	248.30836486816406
24475/28840	Mademoiselle Eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle dArmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no	19.258583068847656
24476/28840	Since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room Madame Danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent	42.40877151489258
24477/28840	In proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a	91.99654388427734
24478/28840	And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and	25.823701858520508
24479/28840	Eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are	51.35280227661133
24480/28840	The affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable	91.6729736328125

24482/28840	And then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on Cavalc	68.13138580322266
24483/28840	This Andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable	47.74775314331055

24486/28840	Villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual	98.36772155761719
24487/28840	But the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could	35.528236389160156

24514/28840	The baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates	22.996185302734375
24515/28840	Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of	41.73966979980469

24522/28840	Alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner I consider those alone misfortunes which are irre	20.006296157836914
24523/28840	And do you suppose this will be forgotten   Everything will be forgotten madame said Ville	17.209732055664062
24524/28840	Your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your	98.22911834716797
24525/28840	Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly	34.27314376831055
24526/28840	Am I come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful	57.57518005371094
24527/28840	You know that you are madame said Villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the	23.164264678955078
24528/28840	And truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and	105.44900512695312
24529/28840	Well then be more affectionate my dear Villefort said the baron	15.658587455749512
24530/28840	Speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when I am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that I ought to be	45.0264892578125
24531/28840	When I hear misfortunes named madame he said I have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then I cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my	33.82933807373047
24532/28840	That is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear env	45.48271179199219

24535/28840	Come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him	49.29169464111328
24536/28840	You are too late madame the orders are	64.52230072021484
24537/28840	Well should he be arresteddo they think they will arrest him   I hope	38.43980026245117
24538/28840	If they should arrest him I know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison   The procureur shook his	46.75358200073242
24539/28840	At least keep him there till my daughter be	880.5684204101562
24540/28840	What even for me said the baroness half jesting half in	35.346710205078125
24541/28840	For all even for myself among the rest replied Ville	98.10338592529297
24542/28840	50063m       Ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation	22.452571868896484
24543/28840	Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the	24.66576385498047
24544/28840	Yes I know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which Valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural	46.82581329345703
24545/28840	I was not thinking of that replied Madame Danglars	14.42375373840332
24546/28840	Yes you were thinking of it and with	54.74593734741211
24547/28840	You could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling The baroness became	63.4909553527832

24553/28840	Villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating	24.69945526123047
24554/28840	For Heavens sake madame said Villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshnessfor Heavens sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch What am Ithe	37.178504943847656
24555/28840	Has the law any eyes to witness your grief Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall No madame the law has commanded and when it commands it	160.09426879882812

24559/28840	Alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness   Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his	40.50356674194336
24560/28840	But said Madame Danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by	28.154850006103516

24563/28840	The weakness of a murderer   His dishonor reflects upon	46.12592697143555
24564/28840	Is not death in my house   Oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then I tell you they will have no mercy on you   Be it so said Villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening	25.20510482788086
24565/28840	At least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six months before	188.18496704101562
24566/28840	No madame said Villefort instructions have been	37.43480682373047

24570/28840	I tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute   Sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the Minister of the	22.22171401977539
24571/28840	Villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the	39.75481033325195
24572/28840	Madame Danglars trembled with fear Villefort started with	26.7783145904541
24573/28840	Arrested he exclaimed he was taken at Compiègne and all is	69.79051971435547
24574/28840	Madame Danglars rose from her seat pale and	32.72657775878906
24575/28840	Adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the	45.23652648925781
24576/28840	Then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand   Come I had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson I only wanted a murder and here it	65.2484130859375
24577/28840	The Apparition   As the procureur had told Madame Danglars Valentine was not yet	31.663131713867188
24578/28840	But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of	41.34318923950195
24579/28840	Indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her	93.97953033447266
24580/28840	During the daytime Valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of	47.523345947265625
24581/28840	Noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness Villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and	49.63509750366211
24582/28840	At six oclock Villefort retired to his study at eight	69.91939544677734
24583/28840	dAvrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then	43.31033706665039
24584/28840	A nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oclock when Valentine was	130.14881896972656
24585/28840	As she went downstairs she gave the keys of Valentines room to	32.64456558227539
24586/28840	de Villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little	20.236536026000977
24587/28840	Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less	68.88306427001953
24588/28840	Certainly though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover Monte Cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be	48.16065979003906
24589/28840	Now four days had elapsed and Valentine still	217.7037811279297
24590/28840	Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully	28.1141414642334
24591/28840	At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bellpull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present	74.54825592041016
24592/28840	Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of	67.9594497680664
24593/28840	From behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize Mor	50.43906021118164
24594/28840	The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound	57.772743225097656
24595/28840	At this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight	64.55805206298828
24596/28840	It is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other	84.21382904052734
24597/28840	Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his	44.508235931396484
24598/28840	This time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything Valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her	121.46404266357422
24599/28840	The pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew	109.38339233398438
24600/28840	Then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its	59.785953521728516
24601/28840	This did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghostfor he trod so softly that no sound was heardthen poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank	70.02582550048828
24602/28840	Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupef	22.07392692565918
24603/28840	Every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice Now you may	67.94930267333984
24604/28840	It was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an ex	30.40228843688965
24605/28840	The man placed his finger on her	26.82401466369629
24606/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo she murm	11.291363716125488
24607/28840	It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to	32.1176643371582
24608/28840	Still the presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered	52.398014068603516
24609/28840	Listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with wearinessfor four days I have not closed them for I have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for Maximil	52.06511306762695
24610/28840	The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired	56.12606430053711
24611/28840	Maximilian she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated itMaximilianhas he then owned all to you  	38.972957611083984
24612/28840	He told me your life was his and I have promised him that you shall	59.925689697265625
24613/28840	You have promised him that I shall live  	40.78813171386719
24614/28840	But sir you spoke of vigilance and	316.4416198730469
24615/28840	Are you a doctor   Yes the best you could have at the present time believe	49.0732536315918
24616/28840	But you say you have watched said Valentine uneasily where have you beenI have not seen	39.119815826416016
24617/28840	The count extended his hand towards the	44.99049758911133
24618/28840	I was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which I have	66.33694458007812
24619/28840	Valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed   Sir I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an	37.64306640625
24620/28840	But drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the	26.98312759399414
24621/28840	Drink this and then take nothing more	714.7335815429688
24622/28840	Valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in	36.87543869018555
24623/28840	Monte Cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to Valentine who smiled and swallowed the	69.52161407470703
24624/28840	Oh yes she exclaimed I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching	90.73383331298828
24625/28840	Thank you sir thank you   This is how you have lived during the last four nights Valentine said the	45.2629280090332
24626/28840	Valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of	48.58359909057617
24627/28840	You saw the person repeated the young	102.06412506103516
24628/28840	What you tell me is horrible	109.87288665771484
24629/28840	You wish to make me believe something too	127.28260040283203
24630/28840	de SaintMéran Madame de SaintMéran Barrois all fall Would not	26.222848892211914
24631/28840	Your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the	167.6793670654297
24632/28840	He has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with	59.00461959838867
24633/28840	But even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too	120.58283996582031
24634/28840	But who then is this assassin this murderer   Let me also ask you a	71.6083755493164
24635/28840	Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life   50073m       No said Valentine who could desire my death   You shall know it now then said Monte Cristo	19.21944808959961
24636/28840	How do you mean said Valentine looking anxiously	21.43718147277832
24637/28840	Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers	110.29244995117188
24638/28840	Oh heavens exclaimed Valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her	112.50141143798828
24639/28840	Midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor	120.4332046508789
24640/28840	Valentine said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will	48.656036376953125
24641/28840	I think I hear a noise she said leave	78.390625
24642/28840	Goodbye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with	41.166141510009766
24643/28840	Before closing the door he turned around once more and said Not a movementnot a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before I have the power of helping	52.946285247802734
24644/28840	And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after	20.91312026977539
24645/28840	Locusta   Valentine was alone two other clocks slower than that of SaintPhilippeduRoule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was	46.34377670288086
24646/28840	Then Valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the	37.77239990234375
24647/28840	She began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubtedthe inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her	58.864444732666016
24648/28840	Why should they To what end What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy   There was no fear of her falling	56.10382843017578
24649/28840	One terrible idea pressed upon her mindthat someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so	63.46223068237305
24650/28840	But through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted	47.725318908691406
24651/28840	Twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half	91.31522369384766
24652/28840	Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the	28.123159408569336
24653/28840	Someone approached the bed and drew back the	29.052772521972656
24654/28840	Valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil	119.48806762695312
24655/28840	The girl shuddered to the heart but did not	34.79032516479492
24656/28840	Still silent Valentine had promised not to	480.3487548828125
24657/28840	Then everything was still excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just	60.52309036254883
24658/28840	Then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended	38.5451545715332
24659/28840	She saw a woman in a white dressinggown pouring a liquor from a phial into her	31.7965030670166
24660/28840	During this short time Valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept it was Madame de Ville	63.03160095214844
24661/28840	On recognizing her stepmother Valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the	74.29849243164062
24662/28840	Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bedcurtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of	30.368587493896484
24663/28840	The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp	37.435089111328125
24664/28840	Then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the	100.6393814086914
24665/28840	Madame de Villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of Valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the	29.068986892700195
24666/28840	Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the	47.66661071777344
24667/28840	She only witnessed the withdrawal of the armthe fair round arm of a woman but twentyfive years old and who yet spread death around	69.68244934082031
24668/28840	50077m       It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the	18.296228408813477
24669/28840	The grating against the librarydoor aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insens	36.367435455322266
24670/28840	She raised her head with an	59.756736755371094

24672/28840	Well said he do you still doubt   Oh murmured the young	16.003803253173828

24684/28840	My father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked Valentine clasping her	72.6234130859375
24685/28840	No and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over youhe should have occupied my placehe should have emptied that glasshe should have risen against the	58.426692962646484
24686/28840	Spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his	100.72042083740234

24688/28840	I will watch over them as I have over	32.75271224975586
24689/28840	Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a	20.62158966064453
24690/28840	Then he drew from his waistcoatpocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her	37.208343505859375
24691/28840	She took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her vener	32.077518463134766
24692/28840	She evidently interrogated him by her	214.68455505371094
24693/28840	Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed	75.35266876220703
24694/28840	And now my dear child adieu for the	44.03998947143555

24697/28840	Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given	29.641252517700195
24698/28840	Valentine   The nightlight continued to burn on the chimneypiece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the	21.653196334838867
24699/28840	The globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final ag	53.62452697753906
24700/28840	A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young	61.544857025146484
24701/28840	All noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was fright	65.9827651977539
24702/28840	It was then that the door of Edwards room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was Madame de Villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had	45.6540641784668
24703/28840	She stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if Valentines glass were	43.29524612426758
24704/28840	It was still about a quarter full as we before	166.4425506591797
24705/28840	Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the	37.12216567993164
24706/28840	If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on	27.240013122558594
24707/28840	The dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own	59.94023513793945
24708/28840	At length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on	62.01436233520508
24709/28840	The young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the halfclosed teeth the white lips no longer quiveredthe eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as	42.67833709716797
24710/28840	Madame de Villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls	27.63134765625
24711/28840	She only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a	51.045654296875
24712/28840	Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to	35.239013671875
24713/28840	The minutes passed Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of	42.813533782958984
24714/28840	She was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is	74.11962127685547
24715/28840	Just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled Madame de Villefort who shuddered and dropped the	33.28501892089844
24716/28840	Immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast	127.0426025390625
24717/28840	Overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of	67.21642303466797
24718/28840	The darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the Venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the	70.29427337646484
24719/28840	About this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her	22.685577392578125
24720/28840	To the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentines condition but to this hireling Valentine only appeared to	48.53228759765625
24721/28840	Good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters	139.5643310546875
24722/28840	Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more	44.34600830078125
24723/28840	Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards Valentine and for the first time noticed the white	46.79905700683594
24724/28840	She tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sickn	66.35377502441406
24725/28840	She screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed   Help help   50083m       What is the matter asked	15.378606796264648
24726/28840	dAvrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited	37.31621551513672
24727/28840	What is it asked Villefort rushing from his	31.58153533935547
24728/28840	Doctor do you hear them call for help   Yes yes let us hasten up it was in Valentines	45.360416412353516
24729/28840	But before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by light	30.825876235961914
24730/28840	Call Madame de VillefortWake Madame de Villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to	23.576122283935547
24731/28840	But instead of obeying him the servants stood watching	111.45684051513672
24732/28840	dAvrigny who ran to Valentine and raised her in his	22.0028018951416
24733/28840	Oh where will be the end   Villefort rushed into the	21.697412490844727
24734/28840	What are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hands to	35.87641906738281
24735/28840	I say that Valentine is dead replied dAvrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calm	22.203750610351562
24736/28840	50085m      	10.513946533203125
24737/28840	de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the	28.00192642211914
24738/28840	Just then Madame de Villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious	26.82166862487793
24739/28840	On a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the	86.59943389892578
24740/28840	She saw dAvrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the	46.3878173828125
24741/28840	It was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the	60.01734161376953
24742/28840	The spectre of Valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her	118.44100952148438
24743/28840	It was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which Valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive	38.10245895385742
24744/28840	dAvrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the	96.7102279663086
24745/28840	Ah exclaimed dAvrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a	22.581430435180664
24746/28840	Madame de Villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and	34.15812683105469
24747/28840	Directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and Villefort was still absorbed in	33.802669525146484
24748/28840	dAvrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried	24.92476463317871
24749/28840	He lifted up the drapery over the entrance to Edwards room and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the	40.13750076293945
24750/28840	Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort he said to the	14.198214530944824
24751/28840	50087m       But Mademoiselle de Villefort stammered the	7.24661111831665
24752/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help said dAvrigny since she is	8.808464050292969
24753/28840	Deaddead groaned forth Villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that	38.668148040771484
24754/28840	Who said Valentine was dead   The two men turned round and saw Morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstr	27.504283905029297
24755/28840	At the usual time Morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtiers	21.19054412841797
24756/28840	Contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he	206.37083435058594
24757/28840	He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to	30.099544525146484
24758/28840	Noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the	114.58329772949219
24759/28840	Morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his	32.66746520996094
24760/28840	Every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by Noirt	42.504478454589844
24761/28840	Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no	107.88764190673828
24762/28840	Noirtiers room was opened like all the	42.41196823120117
24763/28840	The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his	35.196529388427734
24764/28840	How are you sir asked Morrel with a sickness of	46.922630310058594
24765/28840	Well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneas	38.06379699707031
24766/28840	You are thoughtful sir continued Morrel you want something shall I call one of the servants   Yes replied Noirt	38.78995895385742
24767/28840	Morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one	118.64495086669922
24768/28840	He turned towards Noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily	54.92659378051758
24769/28840	Oh exclaimed Morrel why do they not come Is anyone ill in the house The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from their	35.11328125
24770/28840	What is the matter You alarm	43.16679763793945
24771/28840	Valentine Valentine   Yes yes signed Noirt	16.317777633666992
24772/28840	Maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wains	41.03758239746094
24773/28840	Yes yes yes continued the old	14.894753456115723
24774/28840	50089m       Maximilian rushed up the little staircase while Noirtiers eyes seemed to sayQuicker quicker   In a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached Valent	17.562576293945312
24775/28840	There was no occasion to push the door it was wide	61.99369812011719
24776/28840	A sob was the only sound he	152.34292602539062
24777/28840	He saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white draper	67.7657470703125
24778/28840	Maximilian   Villefort rose halfashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of	18.89649772644043
24779/28840	The terrible office he had held for twentyfive years had succeeded in making him more or less than	65.11705780029297
24780/28840	His glance at first wandering fixed itself upon Mor	167.23779296875
24781/28840	Godo you hear said Villefort while dAvrigny advanced to lead Morrel	40.972530364990234
24782/28840	Morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing Noirtier	81.86450958251953
24783/28840	When he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into Valentines	29.60825538635254
24784/28840	This could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful	75.12359619140625
24785/28840	But the most fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other	58.135948181152344
24786/28840	That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful appar	37.867069244384766
24787/28840	Each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had	100.06034088134766
24788/28840	See what they have done cried Morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards	22.72406005859375
24789/28840	See my father see   Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called Noirtier his	22.215389251708984
24790/28840	And the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its	210.6538848876953
24791/28840	DAvrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful rest	168.95315551757812
24792/28840	Sir cried Morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who I am and what right I have to be	41.30153274536133
24793/28840	Oh you know it tell them tell them And the young mans voice was choked by so	117.73512268066406
24794/28840	As for the old man his chest heaved with his panting resp	35.56525421142578
24795/28840	One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding	82.34689331054688
24796/28840	At length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of Noirt	43.29275894165039
24797/28840	Tell them said Morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that I am her betrot	21.163480758666992
24798/28840	Tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the	144.01388549804688
24799/28840	Tell themoh tell them that corpse belongs to me   The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive	39.00224685668945
24800/28840	But Morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of Valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the	70.42192077636719
24801/28840	For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and	92.68487548828125
24802/28840	At length Villefort the most composed of all spoke   Sir said he to Maximilian you say you loved Valentine that you were betrothed to	40.34157943725586
24803/28840	I knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet I her father forgive you for I see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my	77.20896911621094
24804/28840	But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of	42.33503341674805
24805/28840	Take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her	162.7466278076172
24806/28840	Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the	54.94377899169922

24808/28840	What do you mean sir asked Villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of Mor	20.30998992919922
24809/28840	I tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his	121.10842895507812
24810/28840	The eyes of Noirtier glistened and dAvrigny	10.342901229858398
24811/28840	Now sir continued Morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like	86.21370697021484
24812/28840	le Procureur du Roi said Morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed I denounce the crime it is your place to seek the	47.08599853515625
24813/28840	The young mans implacable eyes interrogated Villefort who on his side glanced from Noirtier to dAvrign	19.134166717529297
24814/28840	But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of Maximil	25.086727142333984

24817/28840	The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage and dAvrigny prepared to	16.135169982910156
24818/28840	Morrel however extended his arm and commanded	164.74278259277344
24819/28840	And I say that murders _are_ committed here said Morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four	75.02912139892578
24820/28840	I tell you Valentines life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of	105.56169128417969

24822/28840	I tell you that you know these things as well as I do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a	24.715747833251953
24823/28840	Oh you rave sir exclaimed Villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was	38.79806137084961
24824/28840	50095m       I rave said Morrel well then I appeal to	29.019363403320312
24825/28840	Ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of Madame de SaintMérans	24.89665412902832
24826/28840	You thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of	131.21707153320312
24827/28840	Yes yes continued Morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my	88.6790771484375
24828/28840	Certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by	109.82522583007812
24829/28840	de Villefort towards his own relations I ought to have denounced him to the authorities then I should not have been an accomplice to thy death as I now am sweet beloved Valentine but the accomplice shall become the aven	47.29288864135742
24830/28840	This fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee Valentine it is I and I swear it that shall pursue the	144.99847412109375
24831/28840	And I too he exclaimed in a low voice I unite with	64.90374755859375
24832/28840	Morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly	80.06640625
24833/28840	Morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre   Stay he said	23.828542709350586
24834/28840	Yes indicated Noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his	48.87471008300781
24835/28840	Do you know the assassin asked Mor	30.280006408691406
24836/28840	And will you direct us exclaimed the young	36.0150260925293
24837/28840	dAvrigny listen   Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy and thus fixed his	17.6129207611084
24838/28840	Then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the	47.062522888183594
24839/28840	Do you wish me to leave said Morrel	34.734405517578125
24840/28840	Alas alas sir have pity on me   The old mans eyes remained fixed on the	28.21253776550293
24841/28840	May I at least return asked Mor	76.7957534790039
24842/28840	Must I leave alone  	109.50143432617188

24845/28840	But can he understand you  	52.08407211303711
24846/28840	Oh said Villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him aloneoh be satisfied I can understand my	52.09184646606445
24847/28840	While uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together	69.34729766845703
24848/28840	DAvrigny took the young mans arm and led him out of the	87.98515319824219
24849/28840	A more than deathlike silence then reigned in the	43.73821258544922
24850/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where dAvrigny and Morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in	14.63584041595459
24851/28840	You can come he said and led them back to Noirt	58.70979690551758
24852/28840	His face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to	55.21935272216797
24853/28840	Gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves The two men drew	78.2691650390625

24857/28840	Do you not father   Yes resolutely replied Noirt	27.510658264160156
24858/28840	Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape	37.816436767578125
24859/28840	Oh sir said Villefort arresting Maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that Valentine will be terribly reven	29.98079490661621
24860/28840	Is it not so father   The old man made a sign in the	25.485279083251953
24861/28840	Villefort continued   He knows me and I have pledged my word to	19.310771942138672
24862/28840	Noirtier asked Morrel while dAvrigny looked inquiring	14.416455268859863
24863/28840	Yes replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister	13.2498197555542
24864/28840	Swear then said Villefort joining the hands of Morrel and dAvrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my	20.180953979492188
24865/28840	DAvrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble Yes but Morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and	83.5788345336914
24866/28840	We have before stated that all the servants had	64.59300231933594
24867/28840	de Villefort was therefore obliged to request	37.32113265991211
24868/28840	dAvrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious	54.871070861816406
24869/28840	It was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of Noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his	44.365943908691406
24870/28840	Villefort retired to his study and dAvrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the	39.9889030456543
24871/28840	Noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grand	28.99092674255371
24872/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour	14.957987785339355
24873/28840	dAvrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house Villefort himself was obliged to open to	45.90256118774414
24874/28840	But he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death	116.4766616821289
24875/28840	The two doctors therefore entered the room	145.83164978027344
24876/28840	Noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the	32.358150482177734
24877/28840	The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the	100.81974029541016
24878/28840	Alas said dAvrigny she is indeed dead poor child   50099m       Yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had	15.045219421386719
24879/28840	Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old mans eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his	35.55095291137695
24880/28840	He therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping	58.46598815917969
24881/28840	A tear which appeared in the old mans eye expressed his thanks to the	53.225120544433594
24882/28840	The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by dAvrign	55.263816833496094
24883/28840	Villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to dAvrigny and said   And now the	23.583431243896484
24884/28840	Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine asked dAvrign	57.25417709350586
24885/28840	The nearest said the district doctor is a good Italian abbé who lives next door to	136.1581268310547
24886/28840	Shall I call on him as I pass   DAvrigny said Villefort be so kind I beseech you as to accompany this	29.839941024780273

24889/28840	You will excuse me will you not A priest can understand a fathers	244.98451232910156
24890/28840	de Villefort giving the key to dAvrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to	44.057003021240234
24891/28840	For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflict	542.4564208984375
24892/28840	As the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next	56.493404388427734
24893/28840	This is the abbé of whom I spoke said the doctor to dAvrign	19.137954711914062
24894/28840	Sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter I mean	122.5596694946289
24895/28840	Ah said the priest in a marked Italian accent yes I have heard that death is in that	56.200462341308594
24896/28840	Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of	100.58439636230469
24897/28840	I was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our	164.9720916748047
24898/28840	I know it sir the servants who fled from the house informed	112.53971862792969
24899/28840	I also know that her name is Valentine and I have already prayed for	49.39988708496094
24900/28840	Thank you sir said dAvrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue	78.54137420654297
24901/28840	Come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to	83.2808609008789
24902/28840	I am going sir and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than	60.52698516845703
24903/28840	DAvrigny took the priests hand and without meeting Villefort who was engaged in his study they reached Valentines room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undert	132.59893798828125
24904/28840	On entering the room Noirtiers eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the	43.79448699951172
24905/28840	DAvrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirt	122.95256042480469
24906/28840	In order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as dAvrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to Madame de Villeforts	56.96429443359375
24907/28840	Danglars Signature   The next morning dawned dull and	132.80795288085938
24908/28840	During the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the windingsheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in	344.83294677734375
24909/28840	This windingsheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight	77.09330749511719
24910/28840	During the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried Noirtier from Valentines room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his	145.58340454101562
24911/28840	The Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling	113.50498962402344

24913/28840	They found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling	216.6553497314453
24914/28840	They both stood in amazement at the	54.323272705078125
24915/28840	See said dAvrigny to Villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest	37.59735107421875
24916/28840	Noirtier did not love his child and yet he	113.17926025390625
24917/28840	Yes you are right replied Villefort surprised he sleeps indeed And this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all	299.27777099609375
24918/28840	Grief has stunned him replied dAvrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs	229.68075561523438
24919/28840	See I have not slept said Villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun	209.87533569335938
24920/28840	I have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what I have written during these two days and	133.20567321777344
24921/28840	I have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin Benedet	134.59616088867188
24922/28840	Oh work workmy passion my joy my delightit is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of dAvrign	161.79721069335938

24926/28840	I shall work doctorwhen I work I forget	2875.677490234375
24927/28840	And indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in	99.32215118408203
24928/28840	On the doorsteps dAvrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to	193.68035888671875
24929/28840	He was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be	220.51727294921875
24930/28840	Gradually the receptionroom filled and some of our old friends made their appearancewe mean Debray ChâteauRenaud and Beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for	179.5966339111328

24938/28840	Have you mentioned this death in your paper   It has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed I doubt if it will please	106.18502044677734
24939/28840	Villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kings attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about	172.0345916748047
24940/28840	dAvrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about	233.3302001953125

24945/28840	I believe so replied the secretary with slight uneas	47.5554313659668

24948/28840	I think he has only been introduced to Madame de Ville	12.997395515441895
24949/28840	Still he ought to have been here said Debray I wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the	64.36554718017578
24950/28840	But hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to	195.31607055664062
24951/28840	Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chaussée dAntin to	24.68755531311035
24952/28840	The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable	98.49472045898438
24953/28840	Well said he extending his hand to Monte Cristo I suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my	27.049537658691406
24954/28840	When I perceived you I was just asking myself whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them	287.34735107421875
24955/28840	Well on my word of honor I answered No I wished no ill to Morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our	134.54444885253906

24965/28840	Yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation I ought to be consoled I am	172.2237091064453
24966/28840	So rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare   Danglars smiled at the goodnatured pleasantry of the	60.12481689453125
24967/28840	That reminds me he said that when you entered I was on the point of signing five little bonds I have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others   Pray do	88.07208251953125
24968/28840	There was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the	52.02809524536133
24969/28840	Are they Spanish Haitian or Neapolitan bonds said Monte Crist	190.71353149414062
24970/28840	No said Danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of France payable to	146.7985076904297
24971/28840	Please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my	242.16464233398438
24972/28840	One two three four five said Monte Cristo five millionswhy what a Crœsus you are   This is how I transact business said Dangl	237.8009796142578
24973/28840	It is really wonderful said the count above all if as I suppose it is payable at	188.4434814453125
24974/28840	It is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in France these things are	106.54364776611328
24975/28840	Five millions on five little scraps of paperit must be seen to be	1402.349609375
24976/28840	You do not doubt it   No   You say so with an accentstay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the Treasury for the same	128.22946166992188
24977/28840	No said Monte Cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious I will make the experiment	235.26148986816406
24978/28840	I am credited on you for six	259.7100830078125
24979/28840	I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand franc	28.75556755065918
24980/28840	I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between	347.76873779296875
24981/28840	I had prepared it beforehand for I am much in want of money	179.01190185546875
24982/28840	And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to Dangl	35.724334716796875
24983/28840	If a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater	94.93089294433594
24984/28840	What he stammered do you mean to keep that money Excuse me excuse me but I owe this money to the charity funda deposit which I promised to pay this	150.780029296875
24985/28840	But here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards Danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its	353.7936706542969
24986/28840	Suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed count	122.47840881347656
24987/28840	50109m       Certainly he said your receipt is	84.62265014648438
24988/28840	Oh dear yes and if you were at Rome the house of Thomson  French would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just	77.75496673583984
24989/28840	Then I may keep this money   Yes said Danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his	42.172950744628906
24990/28840	Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say Come reflect if you repent there is still	92.22061920166016
24991/28840	No said Danglars no decidedly no keep my	249.5814666748047
24992/28840	But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business I intended this money for the charity fund and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise	651.9432983398438
24993/28840	How absurdas if one crown were not as good as	1071.923095703125
24994/28840	Excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but	574.5900268554688
24995/28840	Certainly I excuse you said Monte Cristo graciously and pocket	135.84568786621094
24996/28840	And he placed the bonds in his pocket	117.20808410644531
24997/28840	But said Danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs   Oh a mere nothing said Monte Crist	21.865617752075195
24998/28840	The balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be qu	270.92071533203125
24999/28840	Count said Danglars are you speaking seriously   I never joke with bankers said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced  	42.02910232543945
25000/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo I think I arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with	45.927513122558594
25001/28840	Danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count	45.850345611572266
25002/28840	Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with	159.46151733398438
25003/28840	de Boville who was standing in the waitingroom and who was introduced into Danglars room as soon as the count had	38.82472610473633
25004/28840	The counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receivergeneral held in his	294.1298828125
25005/28840	At the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the	92.07624053955078
25006/28840	Meanwhile Danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver	577.07275390625
25007/28840	We need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his	117.1914291381836
25008/28840	Goodmorning creditor said he for I wager anything it is the creditor who visits	922.8458251953125

25010/28840	And yet they say orphans are to be pitied said Danglars wishing to prolong the j	105.43321990966797
25011/28840	Poor things   Here I am in their name said	100.11746978759766
25012/28840	de Boville but did you receive my letter yesterday  	79.08038330078125
25013/28840	50111m       My dear	15.168274879455566
25014/28840	de Boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twentyfour hours since	460.6593933105469
25015/28840	de Monte Cristo whom you just saw leaving hereyou did see him I think   Yes well   Well	103.97498321533203
25016/28840	de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five	84.540771484375
25017/28840	How so   The count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by Thomson  French of Rome he came to demand five millions at once which I paid him with checks on the	104.76343536376953
25018/28840	My funds are deposited there and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the	134.79681396484375
25019/28840	Two days will be a different thing said Danglars	25.939729690551758
25020/28840	Come said Boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me   Perhaps he knows you though you do not know him	83.541259765625
25021/28840	Five millions   Here is his	379.7813720703125
25022/28840	de Boville took the paper Danglars presented him and read   Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson  French of	56.48726272583008
25023/28840	Do you know the house of Thomson  French   Yes I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200000 francs but since then I have not heard it	29.65498161315918
25024/28840	It is one of the best houses in Europe said Danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his	43.96302795410156
25025/28840	de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary	650.7196044921875
25026/28840	I must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from	397.00836181640625
25027/28840	Oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to 20000 francs a	206.69395446777344
25028/28840	It is magnificent I will set before him the example of Madame de Morcerf and her	38.984527587890625
25029/28840	What example   They gave all their fortune to the	341.5013427734375
25030/28840	For what reason   Because they would not spend money so guiltily	609.7320556640625
25031/28840	And what are they to live upon   The mother retires into the country and the son enters the	228.9622344970703
25032/28840	50113m       Well I must confess these are scru	35.96416091918945
25033/28840	I registered their deed of gift	28009.478515625
25034/28840	And how much did they possess   Oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen hundred thousand franc	197.2786102294922
25035/28840	Certainly said Danglars in the most natural tone in the	12.22658920288086
25036/28840	Are you then pressed for this money   Yes for the examination of our cash takes place	245.06724548339844
25037/28840	Tomorrow Why did you not tell me so before Why it is as good as a century At what hour does the examination take place   At two o	45.15073776245117
25038/28840	de Boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the	103.66082000732422
25039/28840	Now I think of it you can do better said Dangl	19.72861099243164
25040/28840	How do you mean   The receipt of	42.30439376831055
25041/28840	de Monte Cristo is as good as money take it to Rothschilds or Lafittes and they will take it off your hands at	238.02334594726562
25042/28840	What though payable at Rome   Certainly it will only cost you a discount of 5000 or 6000 franc	315.6036071777344
25043/28840	_Ma foi_ he said I prefer waiting till	41.968353271484375
25044/28840	What a proposition   I thought perhaps said Danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up   Indeed said the	90.80329895019531
25045/28840	And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some	46.398555755615234
25046/28840	Ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be	406.7604675292969
25047/28840	Better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing	58.57188415527344
25048/28840	How were you to blame in that affair   Listenwhen one bears an irreproachable name as I do one is rather	290.2049865722656
25049/28840	Everybody pities you sir and above all Mademoiselle Danglars   Poor Eugénie said Danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life  	28.717761993408203
25050/28840	Alas it is unhappily but too	65.91496276855469
25051/28840	The day after the event she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or	311.52838134765625
25052/28840	de Boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the	1054.4287109375
25053/28840	Then he doublelocked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in banknotes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed   To Madame la Baronne Dangl	220.41847229003906
25054/28840	I will place it on her table myself tonight he murm	179.74159240722656
25055/28840	Then taking a passport from his drawer he saidGood it is available for two months	592.2093505859375
25056/28840	The Cemetery of PèreLachaise  	37.63381576538086
25057/28840	de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on	282.60040283203125
25058/28840	The weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulev	164.4220428466797
25059/28840	de Villefort a true Parisian considered the cemetery of PèreLachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy	279.43072509765625
25060/28840	He had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his	200.93238830566406
25061/28840	On the front of the monument was inscribed The families of SaintMéran and Villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée Valentines	75.40784454345703
25062/28840	The pompous procession therefore wended its way towards PèreLachaise from the Faubourg SaintHonor	46.53927230834961
25063/28840	Having crossed Paris it passed through the Faubourg du Temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the	273.4678649902344
25064/28840	More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourningcoaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on	244.91139221191406
25065/28840	As they left Paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained Monte Crist	146.42063903808594
25066/28840	The count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on	76.43290710449219
25067/28840	ChâteauRenaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_ joined him Beauchamp did the	41.98862838745117
25068/28840	The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in	199.24139404296875
25069/28840	50119m       Where is Morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is   We have already asked that question said ChâteauRenaud for none of us has seen	30.077062606811523
25070/28840	The count was silent but continued to gaze around	132.4753875732422
25071/28840	At length they arrived at the	108.50059509277344
25072/28840	The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yewtrees Monte Cristo recognized him whom he	271.58721923828125
25073/28840	One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent met	2888.7587890625
25074/28840	Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else	141.4862823486328
25075/28840	Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his	337.4081726074219
25076/28840	Everything was conducted in the usual	200.16094970703125
25077/28840	Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw Morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his	49.89743423461914
25078/28840	See said Beauchamp pointing out Morrel to Debr	22.14132308959961
25079/28840	What is he doing up there And they called ChâteauRenauds attention to	55.0180778503418
25080/28840	How pale he is said ChâteauRenaud shudder	37.294334411621094
25081/28840	Not at all said ChâteauRenaud slowly I think he is violently	55.22264099121094
25082/28840	Bah said Debray he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort you said so	29.069347381591797
25083/28840	Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de Morcer	94.48371887207031
25084/28840	The discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremon	446.4732360839844
25085/28840	And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he	143.1692352294922
25086/28840	The funeral being over the guests returned to	659.5787963867188
25087/28840	ChâteauRenaud looked for a moment for Morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count Morrel had quitted his post and ChâteauRenaud failing in his search joined Debray and Beauch	27.654651641845703
25088/28840	Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of Morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and work	196.2596435546875
25089/28840	Morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unper	116.16533660888672
25090/28840	The count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon Morrel upon the first	235.39659118652344
25091/28840	Monte Cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for Morrel turning round said calmly   You see I was	146.60577392578125
25092/28840	The scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to	120.60888671875
25093/28840	Shall I drive you back to Paris he	160.39073181152344
25094/28840	Do you wish anything   Leave me to	75.69182586669922
25095/28840	The count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards Paris without once looking	175.43736267089844
25096/28840	He walked slowly down the Rue de la Roqu	71.09717559814453
25097/28840	The count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces	258.53680419921875
25098/28840	Maximilian crossed the canal and entered the Rue Meslay by the boulev	71.44265747070312
25099/28840	Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrels entrance it was again opened for the	61.56093978881836
25100/28840	Julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching Penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some Bengal	321.98565673828125
25101/28840	Ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Mes	177.3959503173828
25102/28840	Maximilian has just returned has he not madame asked the	44.19015121459961
25103/28840	50123m       Yes I think I saw him pass but pray call	50.71614074707031
25104/28840	Excuse me madame but I must go up to Maximilians room this instant replied Monte Cristo I have something of the greatest importance to tell	49.58378601074219
25105/28840	Go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had	39.685577392578125
25106/28840	Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to Maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was	90.83690643310547
25107/28840	Like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked Maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the	169.0780792236328
25108/28840	The counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable	105.60660552978516
25109/28840	What shall I do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall I ring No the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder	303.2803955078125
25110/28840	I beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my	107.94764709472656
25111/28840	Since it is opened I will take advantage of it to enter your room do not disturb yourselfdo not disturb yourself   And passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the	59.52558517456055
25112/28840	Morrel evidently discomposed came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his	105.22228240966797
25113/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo rubbing his elbow its all your servants fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on	234.20399475097656

25118/28840	Monte Cristo advanced into the room Maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed	49.94175338745117
25119/28840	You were writing said Monte Cristo with a searching	54.77798080444336
25120/28840	I have already had the honor of telling you I was said Mor	23.324050903320312
25121/28840	Your pistols are beside your desk said Monte Cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the	119.93599700927734
25122/28840	I am on the point of starting on a journey replied Morrel disdain	41.3639030456543
25123/28840	My friend exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite	24.875513076782227
25124/28840	Sir   My friend my dear Maximilian do not make a hasty resolution I entreat	23.23342514038086
25125/28840	I make a hasty resolution said Morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey   50125m       Maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have	38.39839553833008
25126/28840	You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose upon you with my frivolous solicit	249.61883544921875
25127/28840	Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but Monte Cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron	126.36080932617188
25128/28840	You wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written	84.20596313476562
25129/28840	It is a mercy to let me die for if I live I shall lose my reason and become	93.38407135009766
25130/28840	Morrel   Yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and I will do so be satisfied When you spoke to me at the cemetery I answered youmy heart was softened when you arrived here I allowed you to	91.0157470703125
25131/28840	And I again repeat you shall not commit	503.7726135253906
25132/28840	Prevent me then replied Morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron	372.61566162109375
25133/28840	50127m       And who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings   Who am I repeated Monte Crist	192.48980712890625
25134/28840	Morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Crist	147.3666534423828
25135/28840	Julie Emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of Maximil	108.54867553710938
25136/28840	Julie threw herself into the arms of the count Emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel Morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his	80.04617309570312
25137/28840	Then the ironhearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and we	166.78282165527344
25138/28840	For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to	391.3719482421875
25139/28840	Listen my friends said the countI may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven yearsthe discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never	135.96116638183594
25140/28840	I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now I am	111.95166015625
25141/28840	Then turning around and seeing that Morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing Emmanuels hand significantly Watch over	119.20459747314453
25142/28840	Why so asked the young man	75.26956939697266
25143/28840	I cannot explain myself but watch over	84.41678619384766
25144/28840	Emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to	52.94884490966797
25145/28840	Then walking towards Morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stup	81.73668670654297
25146/28840	Julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the	393.3005676269531
25147/28840	While announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on Morrel and remarked that the words I shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his letharg	56.85103225708008
25148/28840	He then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of Emmanuel and Julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father   My kind friends leave me alone with Maximil	119.39044189453125
25149/28840	Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which Monte Cristo had	422.89117431640625
25150/28840	She drew her husband to the	184.69093322753906
25151/28840	The count was alone with Morrel who remained motionless as a	32.20768737792969
25152/28840	Come said MonteCristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again Maximilian   Yes for I begin to suffer	95.22572326660156
25153/28840	The count frowned apparently in gloomy	4606.49560546875
25154/28840	Maximilian Maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a	72.28338623046875
25155/28840	Oh do not fear my friend said Morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count I shall no longer attempt my	37.54536056518555
25156/28840	Then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair   No I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a	182.06979370117188
25157/28840	Poor fellow what is it   My grief will kill me of	163.0486297607422
25158/28840	My friend said Monte Cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to	27.84645652770996
25159/28840	One day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution I also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself	239.72528076171875
25160/28840	Look at me said Monte Cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasivelook at	87.42050170898438
25161/28840	There are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet I see you sufferyou Maximilian whom I love as my own	220.245849609375
25162/28840	Well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond Now if I entreat if I order you to live Morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your	165.5641632080078
25163/28840	Oh heavens said the young man oh heavenswhat are you saying count Take	96.70063018798828
25164/28840	But perhaps you have never loved   Child replied the	107.68756103515625
25165/28840	You see I have been a soldier ever since I attained man	503.474609375
25166/28840	I reached the age of twentynine without loving for none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of	1329.2940673828125
25167/28840	Well at twentynine I saw Valentine for two years I have loved her for two years I have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and	112.86651611328125
25168/28840	Count to possess Valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without Valentine the earth is	808.3610229492188
25169/28840	I have told you to hope said the	18.479482650756836

25171/28840	My friend my father said Morrel with excitement have a care I again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms	518.5068359375
25172/28840	Weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural	665.52392578125
25173/28840	I must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the	209.99066162109375
25174/28840	Ah said Morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despairah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy	446.5636901855469
25175/28840	No my friend I was wrong to caution you do not fear I will bury my grief so deep in my heart I will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with	83.05632019042969
25176/28840	Adieu my friend adieu   On the contrary said the count after this time you must live with meyou must not leave me and in a week we shall have left France behind	36.34567642211914

25178/28840	Count you render me sadder than before if it be	201.491943359375

25180/28840	And Morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredul	62.38498306274414
25181/28840	What can I say more asked Monte Crist	42.54572296142578
25182/28840	I have confidence in the remedy I propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its	133.01829528808594
25183/28840	Or take care Morrel lest I call you ungr	193.32705688476562
25184/28840	Will you promise me   Yes for I am a man and have suffered like yourself and also contemplated suicide indeed often since misfortune has left me I have longed for the delights of an eternal	159.76708984375
25185/28840	But you are sure you will promise me this said Morrel	88.4148941040039
25186/28840	I not only promise but swear it said Monte Cristo extending his	40.36845397949219
25187/28840	I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of September it is ten years today since I saved your fathers life who wished to	43.57179260253906
25188/28840	Morrel seized the counts hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to	59.05706024169922
25189/28840	In a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that	128.2259063720703
25190/28840	Oh I also swear it   Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his	28.871776580810547
25191/28840	And now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy Haydées apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my	72.21965026855469
25192/28840	Haydée said Morrel what has become of her   She departed last	50.28887939453125
25193/28840	To leave you   To wait for	33.380680084228516
25194/28840	Hold yourself ready then to join me at the ChampsÉlysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my	48.57583999633789
25195/28840	Maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike	100.34520721435547
25196/28840	Dividing the Proceeds   The apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue SaintGermaindesPrés where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious	122.57645416259766
25197/28840	Contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his _incognito_ was strictly	208.11859130859375
25198/28840	His visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oclock though he never spent the night	311.7149963378906
25199/28840	At halfpast three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same	115.40018463134766
25200/28840	At four oclock as we have already stated the mysterious personage	57.948795318603516
25201/28840	Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light	154.31039428710938
25202/28840	No one ever asked her where she was	165.4155731201172
25203/28840	Her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for	306.2062683105469
25204/28840	We need not say she stopped at the first	130.7322540283203
25205/28840	Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no	167.07949829101562
25206/28840	They used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the	520.9129028320312
25207/28840	The lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handker	137.39947509765625
25208/28840	The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten oclock in the morning instead of four in the	52.106712341308594
25209/28840	Almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily	649.6193237304688
25210/28840	Well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the ladys agitation revealed tell me what is the	73.4131851196289
25211/28840	Oh Lucien can I confide in you   Of course you know you can do	41.96750259399414
25212/28840	But what can be the matter Your note of this morning has completely bewildered	239.05340576171875
25213/28840	Come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at	516.645263671875
25214/28840	Lucien a great event has happened said the lady glancing inquiringly at Lucien	105.5023193359375
25215/28840	Danglars left last night   Left	224.48382568359375
25216/28840	Danglars left Where has he gone   I do not	18.030677795410156
25217/28840	Then what did you mean   Stayhe left a letter for	66.65605926513672
25218/28840	A letter   Yes read	97.2917709350586
25219/28840	And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to Debr	19.54196548461914
25220/28840	Debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might	261.4384460449219
25221/28840	No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows   Madame and most faithful	64.0127944946289
25222/28840	Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with bl	55.15287780761719
25223/28840	Debray continued   When you receive this you will no longer have a	55.257041931152344
25224/28840	Oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of	78.56938934326172
25225/28840	I owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me I will give	80.14540100097656
25226/28840	I received this morning five millions which I paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me I put this creditor off till tomorrow and I intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to	179.91213989257812
25227/28840	For women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but I who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived	403.9666442871094
25228/28840	Have you admired the rapidity of my fall Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots I confess I have seen nothing but the fire let us hope you have found some gold among the	184.03038024902344
25229/28840	With this consoling idea I leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes I have already mentioned and above all the liberty I hasten to restore to	160.502197265625
25230/28840	And here madame I must add another word of	95.8617172241211
25231/28840	So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter I philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another mans	169.88848876953125
25232/28840	You were rich when I married you but little	604.419921875
25233/28840	Excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves I do not see why I should weigh my	219.2144317626953
25234/28840	I have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned itwithout any fault of mine I can honestly	616.5753173828125
25235/28840	You madame have only sought to increase your own and I am convinced that you have	53.69858932495117
25236/28840	I leave you therefore as I took yourich but little	923.825927734375

25239/28840	Your very devoted husband   Baron Dangl	57.46299743652344
25240/28840	The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his selfcontrol change color once or	147.44747924804688
25241/28840	When he had ended the perusal he folded the letter and resumed his pensive	224.1569366455078
25242/28840	Well asked Madame Danglars with an anxiety easy to be	50.03534698486328
25243/28840	With what ideas does that letter inspire you   Oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that	71.59445190429688
25244/28840	Certainly but is this all you have to say to me   I do not understand you said Debray with freezing cold	38.13410186767578
25245/28840	He is gone Gone never to return   Oh madame do not think that   I tell you he will never	51.308467864990234
25246/28840	I know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own	183.52586364746094
25247/28840	Debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous	104.74949645996094
25248/28840	Well she said at length do you not answer me   I have but one question to ask youwhat do you intend to do   I was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating	15.31399154663086
25249/28840	Ah then you wish to ask advice of me   Yes I do wish to ask your advice said Madame Danglars with anxious	30.483732223510742
25250/28840	Then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly I would recommend you to	32.197967529296875
25251/28840	Danglars says you are rich and perfectly	31.998689651489258
25252/28840	In my opinion a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars broken contract and	106.40129089355469
25253/28840	The world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of op	499.82843017578125
25254/28840	You have only to remain in Paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the	332.14544677734375
25255/28840	Then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyones mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterested	263.54583740234375
25256/28840	They will know you are deserted and think you also poor for I alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest	300.83990478515625
25257/28840	The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had	105.55741882324219
25258/28840	Deserted she repeated ah yes I am indeed deserted You are right sir and no one can doubt my	279.2109375
25259/28840	These were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to Debr	648.3654174804688

25261/28840	Madame Danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush	92.0650863647461
25262/28840	At length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single	372.1200866699219
25263/28840	Madame said Debray it is nearly six months since we have been	40.78946304321289
25264/28840	You furnished a principal of 100000 franc	222.06991577148438
25265/28840	Our partnership began in the month of	1258.67822265625
25266/28840	In May we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450000 franc	345.7319030761719
25267/28840	In June the profit amounted to 900	2585.008056640625
25268/28840	In July we added 1700000 francsit was you know the month of the Spanish	364.2432556152344
25269/28840	Now madame said Debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still 80000 francs the interest of this money in my	135.23536682128906
25270/28840	But said the baroness I thought you never put the money out to	48.67195510864258
25271/28840	Excuse me madame said Debray coldly I had your permission to do so and I have made use of	24.447656631469727
25272/28840	There are then 40000 francs for your share besides the 100000 you furnished me to begin with making in all 1340000 francs for your	249.67074584960938
25273/28840	Now madame I took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and I was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my	111.43892669677734
25274/28840	There is your moneyhalf in banknotes the other half in checks payable to	1276.0169677734375
25275/28840	Danglars will pay you the amount you may rest	37.782310485839844
25276/28840	Madame Danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank	212.6419219970703
25277/28840	This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the	183.2921905517578
25278/28840	Madame Danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the banknotes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocketbook and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of	461.1466369628906
25279/28840	Now madame said Debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at	58.00312042236328
25280/28840	You will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and I am ready to offer you all I possess on	97.89315795898438
25281/28840	Thank you sirthank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the	84.98176574707031
25282/28840	Debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say As you please mad	76.14212036132812
25283/28840	Bah said Debray when she had left these are fine projects She will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the B	266.79730224609375
25284/28840	Then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid	224.4713897705078
25285/28840	I have 1060000 francs remaining he	315.14208984375

25287/28840	And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame Danglars departure before he left the	65.1323013305664
25288/28840	During this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his	197.81336975097656
25289/28840	Above the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a half with Madame Danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some	186.26422119140625
25290/28840	Mercédès and Albert were in that	19.323022842407227
25291/28840	It was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdens	447.3505554199219
25292/28840	Albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual	736.9443969726562
25293/28840	If he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly	231.33651733398438
25294/28840	50141m       Mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide	154.11627197265625
25295/28840	Amongst the Catalans Mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted	64.5711441040039
25296/28840	So long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new	329.19976806640625
25297/28840	And then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herselfof no one but	340.0862731933594
25298/28840	Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live	228.9061279296875
25299/28840	Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained	996.4544067382812
25300/28840	Excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of	4297.78125
25301/28840	But the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the	261.93719482421875
25302/28840	Mother exclaimed Albert just as Madame Danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please I want capital to build my plans	189.9911346435547
25303/28840	Capitalnothing replied Mercédès with a mournful	12.162779808044434
25304/28840	And I have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3000 franc	284.0578918457031
25305/28840	Alas dear mother said the young man I have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of	47.55217742919922
25306/28840	These 3000 francs are enormous and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the	830.1491088867188
25307/28840	You say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these 3000 francs said Mercédès	57.57951354980469
25308/28840	I think so answered Albert in a firm	28.12357521057129
25309/28840	We will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan at Marse	29.154224395751953
25310/28840	With 200 francs we can reach Marse	417.1561584472656
25311/28840	With 200 francsare you sure Albert   Oh as for that I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are	601.9584350585938
25312/28840	You will take your place in the _coupé_ to Châl	18.625022888183594
25313/28840	You see mother I treat you handsomely for thirtyfive franc	617.3849487304688
25314/28840	Let us put down 120 added Albert	5300.89599609375
25315/28840	You see I am generous am I not mother   But you my poor child   I do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself A young man does not require luxuries besides I know what travelling	127.8045425415039
25316/28840	With a postchaise and valet de chambre   Any way	58.48548126220703
25317/28840	But these 200 francs   Here they are and 200 more	420.61602783203125
25318/28840	See I have sold my watch for 100 francs and the guard and seals for	401.20037841796875
25319/28840	How fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the	127.64344787597656
25320/28840	Still the same story of superfluities Now I think we are rich since instead of the 114 francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of	248.289306640625
25321/28840	But we owe something in this house   Thirty francs but I pay that out of my 150 francsthat is understoodand as I require only eighty francs for my journey you see I am overwhelmed with	190.14971923828125
25322/28840	But whence have you obtained them   Listen to me mother and do not yield too much to	107.84706115722656
25323/28840	And Albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at	384.36639404296875
25324/28840	You cannot imagine mother how beautiful I think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial	133.15443420410156
25325/28840	You are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw   Dear child said Mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her	28.003673553466797
25326/28840	Indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to	242.01654052734375
25327/28840	I am not unhappy while I possess my son   Ah just so said Albert here begins the	147.7637939453125
25328/28840	Well mother I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the Spahis25 added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his selfabas	257.8577880859375
25329/28840	I thought my body was my own and that I might sell	71.12823486328125
25330/28840	I yesterday took the place of	139.1675262451172
25331/28840	I sold myself for more than I thought I was worth he added attempting to smile I fetched 2000 franc	96.16219329833984
25332/28840	Then these 1000 francs said Mercédès shudder	54.1142463684082
25333/28840	Are the half of the sum mother the other will be paid in a	130.79205322265625
25334/28840	Mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her	24.255529403686523
25335/28840	The price of his blood she murm	263.7781982421875
25336/28840	Yes if I am killed said Albert	63.04287338256836
25337/28840	But I assure you mother I have a strong intention of defending my person and I never felt half so strong an inclination to live as I do	109.71211242675781
25338/28840	Mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her	55.94797134399414
25339/28840	Well now you understand mother continued Albert here are more than 4000 francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two	255.2329864501953

25343/28840	Well I will live if you promise me still to hope and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my	54.29838562011719
25344/28840	Then I will go to the governor of Algeria he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier I will tell him my gloomy	168.5371551513672

25348/28840	It is well replied Mercédès with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of	49.38230514526367
25349/28840	But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man I assure you we are or rather we shall be very	46.058658599853516

25355/28840	And so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of	658.391357421875

25360/28840	Well be it solet us part said Mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cash	299.801513671875
25361/28840	Albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the	200.1861572265625
25362/28840	Someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned	129.02963256835938
25363/28840	You Morcerf replied the secretary resting on the	86.0291519165039
25364/28840	Curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_ and he was	178.77203369140625
25365/28840	It was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in	56.91390609741211
25366/28840	Then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf   Pardon me he added with a smile I leave you	71.91045379638672
25367/28840	Mother he said turning towards Mercédès this is	20.880252838134766
25368/28840	Debray secretary of the Minister for the Interior once a friend of	284.4447326660156
25369/28840	How once stammered Debray what do you mean   I say so	21.58051872253418
25370/28840	Debray because I have no friends now and I ought not to have	27.677265167236328
25371/28840	I thank you for having recognized me	55.53717803955078
25372/28840	Debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interloc	110.58635711669922
25373/28840	Believe me dear Albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feelingbelieve me I feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way I can serve you I am	50.94015121459961
25374/28840	In the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from	74.8720474243164
25375/28840	We are leaving Paris and when our journey is paid we shall have 5000 francs	111.25521850585938
25376/28840	This parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran	765.00439453125
25377/28840	That day the ministers clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his illhum	180.70675659179688
25378/28840	But that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the Boulevard de la Madeleine and an income of 50000 liv	37.59615707397461
25379/28840	The next day just as Debray was signing the deed that is about five oclock in the afternoon Madame de Morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the _coupé_ of the diligence which closed upon	55.083152770996094
25380/28840	A man was hidden in Lafittes bankinghouse behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk he saw Mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw Albert	328.1151123046875
25381/28840	Then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with	49.56326675415039
25382/28840	The Lions Den   One division of La Force in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined is called the court of SaintBern	826.4159545898438
25383/28840	The prisoners in their expressive language have named it the Lions Den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers	1541.4876708984375
25384/28840	It is a prison within a prison the walls are double the thickness of the	447.4320983886719
25385/28840	The gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and	823.4359130859375

25388/28840	The court of SaintBernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the	553.77587890625
25389/28840	It is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron	299.1081237792969
25390/28840	In the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the Den might be seen	161.75656127929688
25391/28840	Some of the inmates of the Lions Den were watching the operations of the prisoners toilet with considerable	257.2957763671875
25392/28840	See the prince is pluming himself said one of the	601.0953979492188

25394/28840	His coat looks nearly new and his boots are	1414.9769287109375

25396/28840	What jealousy to tear such clothes   He looks like a bigbug said another dresses in fine	1903.3831787109375
25397/28840	And then to be here so young Oh what larks   Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was	223.81857299804688
25398/28840	Come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with	85.20992279052734

25400/28840	Come said Andrea you are a man void of compassion Ill have you turned	84.30033111572266
25401/28840	This made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud	135.7580108642578
25402/28840	The prisoners then approached and formed a	399.36407470703125

25408/28840	But Andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be	347.99481201171875
25409/28840	It was a Masonic sign Caderousse had taught	308.3182373046875
25410/28840	He was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the ironheeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it	204.49398803710938
25411/28840	Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscienceand the mob	166.22665405273438
25412/28840	The keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the Lions Den to something more substantial than mere	358.48846435546875
25413/28840	Andrea made no resistance although he protested against	1098.969482421875
25414/28840	Suddenly a voice was heard at the w	44.15376663208008
25415/28840	To the visitors room said the same	528.5159301757812
25416/28840	You see someone pays me a	603.0533447265625
25417/28840	Ah my dear sir you will see whether a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person   And Andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in	127.5235366821289
25418/28840	Certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished Andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force had maintained a rigid	897.0121459960938

25423/28840	I will say and do nothing until I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then   Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably	68.44218444824219

25425/28840	He had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and	757.9822998046875
25426/28840	It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visiting	281.0075378417969
25427/28840	Andrea felt his heart leap with	2614.358154296875
25428/28840	It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped	167.64923095703125
25429/28840	Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of	65.86051177978516
25430/28840	Bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other gr	205.58863830566406
25431/28840	Good morning Benedetto said Bertuccio with his deep hollow	124.43255615234375
25432/28840	Youyou said the young man looking fearfully around	81.26466369628906
25433/28840	Do you not recognize me unhappy child   Silencebe silent said Andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for Heavens sake do not speak so loud   You wish to speak with me alone do you not said Bertucc	75.03252410888672
25434/28840	And Bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the w	84.3033447265625
25435/28840	An order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to	50.536441802978516
25436/28840	Then he mentally addedStill my unknown protector I am not	1978.462890625

25438/28840	I understand Bertuccio has been sent by my	57.379844665527344
25439/28840	The keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first	152.7979736328125
25440/28840	The room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous	378.3912658691406
25441/28840	Bertuccio sat down upon the chair Andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper	173.14353942871094
25442/28840	Now said the steward what have you to tell me   And you said	16.458425521850586

25461/28840	Well am I to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying My father my father like Monsieur Pixéré	705.0502319335938
25462/28840	27   Do not let us jest gravely replied Bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced	67.96538543701172
25463/28840	Bah said Andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of Bertuccios manner why not   Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to be the father of such a wretch as	68.28772735595703
25464/28840	And there will be fine doings if you do not take	96.21002197265625
25465/28840	I will say   Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself said Bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that Andrea was moved to the very	83.14314270019531

25470/28840	Come who is my father   I came to tell	18.978742599487305
25471/28840	Ah cried Benedetto his eyes sparkling with	27.62441635131836
25472/28840	Just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to Bertuccio said   Excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the	53.612342834472656
25473/28840	And so closes our interview said Andrea to the worthy steward I wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil   I will return tomorrow said Bertucc	120.31547546386719
25474/28840	Good Gendarmes I am at your	56.987796783447266
25475/28840	Ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of   It shall be done replied Bertucc	65.44640350341797
25476/28840	Andrea extended his hand Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of	194.8739013671875
25477/28840	Thats what I mean said Andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of Bertucc	51.428646087646484
25478/28840	Can I be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad	506.95904541015625
25479/28840	Never mind we shall see Tomorrow then he added turning towards Bertucc	90.04113006591797
25480/28840	The Judge   We remember that the Abbé Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girls	38.350830078125
25481/28840	de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the	26.893840789794922
25482/28840	The assizes also were about to begin and Villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Cader	115.04981231689453
25483/28840	This affair like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in	47.46752166748047
25484/28840	The proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galleyslave on his deathbed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his	175.1062469482422
25485/28840	But the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his selflove which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen	223.3307342529297
25486/28840	The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of Villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming ass	150.41307067871094
25487/28840	He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of	286.24688720703125
25488/28840	And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his	120.82100677490234
25489/28840	Once only had Villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto when the latter was to learn his fathers	50.51944351196289
25490/28840	The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could scarcely	39.31380844116211
25491/28840	His glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that Villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was	154.23727416992188
25492/28840	Villefort became pale he understood the old mans	42.8897590637207
25493/28840	Madame de Villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sons ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a	144.3207550048828
25494/28840	Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the	61.37095642089844
25495/28840	Villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the	106.46711730957031
25496/28840	As he approached it Noirtiers gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his	107.28270721435547
25497/28840	In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible	372.2510681152344
25498/28840	Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten	65.28488159179688
25499/28840	It is well sir replied Villefort from belowit is well have patience but one day longer what I have said I will	99.58905792236328
25500/28840	Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other	43.36835861206055
25501/28840	Villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his	80.33816528320312
25502/28840	The next day Monday was the first sitting of the ass	433.5973815917969
25503/28840	The morning dawned dull and gloomy and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red	224.8769073486328
25504/28840	The magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in	265.02191162109375
25505/28840	He opened the window a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the	199.47789001464844
25506/28840	In the cloverfields beyond the chestnuttrees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning	738.0042724609375
25507/28840	The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort and refreshed his	286.6610412597656
25508/28840	Today he said with an efforttoday the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is	278.1407165527344
25509/28840	Involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtiers room where he had seen him the preceding	95.55152893066406
25510/28840	The curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old	66.6763687133789
25511/28840	His head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and	300.7894287109375
25512/28840	Villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of	350.0909423828125
25513/28840	What are you bringing me said	135.16749572753906
25514/28840	Who has paid me this attention   My mistress	153.88612365722656
25515/28840	She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with	81.8204116821289
25516/28840	Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one dra	68.95714569091797
25517/28840	It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than	72.87018585205078
25518/28840	He then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to	51.8397331237793
25519/28840	Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven oclock has just struck and that the trial commences at	68.32899475097656
25520/28840	Well said Villefort what then   Madame de Villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir   Where to   To the Pal	25.692893981933594

25522/28840	Ah said Villefort with a startling accent does she wish that   The servant drew back and said If you wish to go alone sir I will go and tell my	44.365318298339844
25523/28840	Villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his	65.99664306640625
25524/28840	Tell your mistress he at length answered that I wish to speak to her and I beg she will wait for me in her own	60.685062408447266
25525/28840	Then come to dress and shave	1303.08349609375
25526/28840	The valet reappeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in	496.0605163574219
25527/28840	When he had finished he said   My mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished	96.9952163696289
25528/28840	And Villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his	65.47518157958984
25529/28840	At the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale	158.42706298828125
25530/28840	Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young Edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading	421.35498046875
25531/28840	She was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her	81.79135131835938
25532/28840	de Villefort remained mute and cold as a	44.9043083190918

25534/28840	Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange prelimin	56.74607849121094
25535/28840	Edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the heads of his leaden	146.10728454589844
25536/28840	de Villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear meGo   The child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or	151.14915466308594
25537/28840	His father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his	42.347049713134766
25538/28840	de Villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and	33.52215576171875
25539/28840	Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its	304.07843017578125
25540/28840	A hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly	135.04217529296875
25541/28840	Monsieur she said II do not understand	56.20364761352539
25542/28840	And in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cush	82.65452575683594
25543/28840	I asked you continued Villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my fatherinlaw	41.5025634765625

25659/28840	Has he assassinated anyone then   No on the contrary they wished to assassinate	91.11062622070312

25704/28840	And now prisoner will you consent to tell your name said the	161.61679077148438
25705/28840	The brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to	429.6922912597656
25706/28840	You appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your	128.47494506835938
25707/28840	You wished it to be preceded by all these	120.36810302734375
25708/28840	President how entirely you have read my thoughts said Benedetto in his softest voice and most polite	128.79493713378906
25709/28840	This is indeed the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the	89.68123626708984
25710/28840	The public astonishment had reached its	217.56565856933594
25711/28840	There was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the	241.51943969726562
25712/28840	The audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous pre	1657.630615234375
25713/28840	Well said the president your name   I cannot tell you my name since I do not know it but I know my fathers and can tell it to	28.407508850097656
25714/28840	A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed	153.70675659179688
25715/28840	Repeat your fathers name said the	63.131526947021484

25720/28840	The explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the	127.6122817993164
25721/28840	de Villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and	605.0892333984375
25722/28840	Order was reestablished in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one	186.38487243652344
25723/28840	A lady it was said had just fainted they had supplied her with a smellingbottle and she had	162.90213012695312
25724/28840	They ask my age I tell	857.9850463867188

25726/28840	They ask my name I cannot give it since my parents abandoned	319.41796875
25727/28840	But though I cannot give my own name not possessing one I can tell them my	168.83743286132812
25728/28840	Now I repeat my father is named	148.19981384277344
25729/28840	de Villefort and I am ready to prove	25.58173179626465
25730/28840	There was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the	238.164794921875
25731/28840	All eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a	61.41345977783203
25732/28840	Gentlemen said Andrea commanding silence by his voice and manner I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have	306.28863525390625
25733/28840	But said the irritated president you called yourself Benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claimed Corsica as your	405.3226623535156
25734/28840	I said anything I pleased in order that the solemn declaration I have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the	201.59756469726562
25735/28840	I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of the 27th of September 1817 and that I am the son of the procureur	24.578073501586914

25738/28840	A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of	152.6142578125
25739/28840	But how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the	30.565481185913086
25740/28840	A man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried	126.91847229003906
25741/28840	He was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still	226.3615264892578
25742/28840	The man carried me to the foundling asylum where I was registered under the number	1174.27490234375
25743/28840	Three months afterwards a woman travelled from Rogliano to Paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her son carried me	300.6411437988281
25744/28840	Thus you see though born in Paris I was brought up in Cors	109.54781341552734
25745/28840	There was a moments silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the still	103.97359466552734
25746/28840	Certainly I might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my	492.55633544921875
25747/28840	I increased in wickedness till I committed	1658.0703125
25748/28840	After that I ceased to blaspheme but I cursed my	814.128662109375
25749/28840	That is why I have uttered the words for which you blame me that is why I have filled this whole assembly with	162.76089477539062
25750/28840	If I have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity	189.85057067871094
25751/28840	My mother thought me dead she is not	315.99273681640625
25752/28840	I did not even wish to know her name nor do I know	40.59156799316406
25753/28840	Just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hyster	133.3369598388672
25754/28840	She was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and Madame Danglars was	76.4044189453125
25755/28840	Notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain Villefort rose as he perceived	685.7916259765625
25756/28840	The proofs the proofs said the president remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest	1149.299560546875
25757/28840	The proofs said Benedetto laughing do you want proofs  	40.12385559082031
25758/28840	de Villefort and then ask me for	115.7905502319336
25759/28840	Everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his	218.36355590820312
25760/28840	The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of aston	109.32821655273438
25761/28840	Father said Benedetto I am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them   No no it is useless stammered	43.49416732788086
25762/28840	de Villefort in a hoarse voice no it is useless   How useless cried the president what do you mean   I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes	57.966957092285156
25763/28840	Gentlemen I know I am in the hands of an avenging God We need no proofs everything relating to this young man is	260.6081237792969
25764/28840	A dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in	382.52117919921875
25765/28840	de Villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination What are you no longer in possession of your senses This strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your	115.5709457397461
25766/28840	The procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly	87.05236053466797
25767/28840	I am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may	166.1385498046875
25768/28840	I acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed	118.96123504638672
25769/28840	And as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door	35.98870849609375
25770/28840	The whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian	105.84037017822266
25771/28840	Well said Beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural   _Ma foi_ said ChâteauRenaud I would rather end my career like	44.4715690612793
25772/28840	de Morcerf a pistolshot seems quite delightful compared with this	591.94140625
25773/28840	And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter said Debr	27.587764739990234
25774/28840	She did well to die poor girl   The sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another	704.7036743164062
25775/28840	As for Andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some	87.06448364257812
25776/28840	Well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked Debray of the sergeantatarms slipping a louis into his	69.2813949584961
25777/28840	There will be extenuating circumstances he	550.26318359375
25778/28840	Expiation   Notwithstanding the density of the crowd	773.770751953125
25779/28840	de Villefort saw it open before	44.62065124511719
25780/28840	There is something so aweinspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great	247.36080932617188
25781/28840	Many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during	706.2800903320312
25782/28840	Thus Villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the Palais and	80.13565063476562
25783/28840	Though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his	417.0640563964844
25784/28840	There are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of	649.7073364257812
25785/28840	Those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as	446.7568664550781
25786/28840	It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort left the Pal	30.430301666259766
25787/28840	Every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand	564.76953125
25788/28840	He made his way along the corridors through force of habit he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of Nessus insatiate in	570.5930786132812
25789/28840	Having staggered as far as the Rue Dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the Faubourg SaintHonoré the carriage drove	42.393646240234375
25790/28840	All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already	457.43060302734375
25791/28840	God he murmured not knowing what he saidGodGod Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of	248.6040496826172
25792/28840	Villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against	237.21469116210938
25793/28840	He put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like	122.10159301757812
25794/28840	50189m       Oh he exclaimed as though a redhot iron were piercing his	119.07938385009766
25795/28840	During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented	359.03228759765625
25796/28840	We will flee from Paris and go as far as the earth	173.08755493164062
25797/28840	And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the	62.19960403442383
25798/28840	Faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coach	274.84271240234375
25799/28840	The horses impelled by fear flew towards the	496.7476806640625
25800/28840	Yes yes repeated Villefort as he approached his homeyes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my	226.21533203125
25801/28840	She loves him it was for his sake she has committed these	357.4078674316406
25802/28840	We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her	106.07238006591797
25803/28840	She will repent and no one will know that she has been	135.92694091796875
25804/28840	The events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then I will add them to my list of	215.92422485351562
25805/28840	What will it signify if one two or three more are added My wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with	234.41326904296875
25806/28840	I shall have performed a good action and my heart will be	140.0787811279297
25807/28840	And the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some	48.29207992553711
25808/28840	50191m       The carriage stopped at the door of the	9.045877456665039
25809/28840	Villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their	54.72904968261719
25810/28840	Neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing	249.31182861328125
25811/28840	Noirtiers room he perceived two figures through the halfopen door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on	210.70159912109375
25812/28840	Come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifes room nothing is changed	71.32308197021484
25813/28840	He then closed the door of the	37.89830017089844
25814/28840	No one must disturb us he said I must speak freely to her accuse myself and sayhe approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his	276.97021484375
25815/28840	Not locked he cried that is	441.6733093261719
25816/28840	And he entered the little room in which Edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at	106.40287017822266
25817/28840	With a single glance Villeforts eye ran through the	49.75966262817383
25818/28840	Not here he said doubtless she is in her	98.92539978027344
25819/28840	He rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shudder	162.8987274169922
25820/28840	He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being	38.581321716308594
25821/28840	Who is there answered the voice of her he	183.65457153320312
25822/28840	He thought that voice more feeble than	789.0982666015625
25823/28840	But notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained	217.76898193359375
25824/28840	Villefort burst it open with a violent	163.4626922607422
25825/28840	At the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir Madame de Villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring	88.19475555419922
25826/28840	Héloïse Héloïse he said what is the matter Speak The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards	29.622163772583008
25827/28840	It is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her	40.05582046508789
25828/28840	What more do you want and she fell full length on the	145.5826416015625
25829/28840	Villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden sto	114.41383361816406
25830/28840	Villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the	165.9511260986328
25831/28840	My son he exclaimed suddenly where is my sonEdward Edward and he rushed out of the room still crying Edward Edward The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran	277.2235107421875

25835/28840	A cold perspiration burst out on Villeforts brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered	141.971923828125
25836/28840	In Madame de Villeforts room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the	31.627164840698242
25837/28840	To enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate	114.45458984375
25838/28840	To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the silence of the	318.96697998046875

25842/28840	The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious	171.2294464111328
25843/28840	Through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin	126.88827514648438
25844/28840	Villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lyingno doubt asleepon the	677.9066162109375
25845/28840	The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and	45.59416198730469
25846/28840	He had only to step over the corpse enter the boudoir take the child in his arms and flee far far	304.8801574707031

25916/28840	But does Maximilian go to Rome exclaimed	205.07167053222656

25932/28840	Restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered Julie to Monte Crist	427.5050964355469

25942/28840	The Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage	72.2523422241211

26005/28840	Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the	264.67449951171875

26017/28840	Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a	104.3132553100586
26018/28840	It often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole	371.9976806640625

26025/28840	From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular	116.89100646972656
26026/28840	Not a thought was given to a life which you once Mercédès had the power to render blissful not one hour of peaceful calm was mine but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating	273.78515625

26037/28840	The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of Edmond Dantè	46.13408660888672
26038/28840	I approve of the deed but I must pray for the	114.23992919921875
26039/28840	Your son shall be happy Mercédès repeated the	41.08880615234375
26040/28840	Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly	191.3202362060547
26041/28840	But what are your intentions   Mercédès smiled	15.650178909301758
26042/28840	To say that I shall live here like the Mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe	152.80810546875
26043/28840	I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in	104.4719009399414
26044/28840	However I shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which I found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain	70.9410629272461
26045/28840	Rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of livingthat will signify but little that concerns God you and	1128.592529296875
26046/28840	Mercédès said the count I do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by	70.35218048095703
26047/28840	de Morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and	242.07009887695312
26048/28840	I perceive what you are intending to propose to me but I cannot accept it Edmondmy son would not permit	63.79035186767578
26049/28840	Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de Morcer	35.566925048828125
26050/28840	I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to	59.431365966796875

26052/28840	I have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that I am become passive in the hands of the Almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an	179.8788604736328
26053/28840	I live because it is not ordained for me to	58.21078872680664
26054/28840	If succor be sent to me I will accept	134.5569610595703
26055/28840	Ah madame said Monte Cristo you should not talk thus It is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free	66.63053894042969
26056/28840	Alas exclaimed Mercédès if it were so if I possessed freewill but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to	135.2216339111328
26057/28840	Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her	48.415977478027344
26058/28840	Will you not even say you will see me again he	104.62445831298828
26059/28840	On the contrary we shall meet again said Mercédès pointing to heaven with solemn	24.459190368652344

26061/28840	And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count Mercédès rushed up the stairs and	49.438499450683594
26062/28840	Monte Cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the qu	65.3464584350586
26063/28840	But Mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dantè	24.37845230102539
26064/28840	The Past   The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès probably never to behold her	82.3876953125
26065/28840	Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Crist	65.50772094726562
26066/28840	Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before	208.5165252685547
26067/28840	More than this the conversation which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with	47.86170196533203
26068/28840	A man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior	1192.565673828125
26069/28840	He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame	113.24291229248047
26070/28840	I cannot have deceived myself he said I must look upon the past in a false	115.83544921875
26071/28840	The reason why I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the	165.7865447998047
26072/28840	The past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we	712.7542114257812
26073/28840	My position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received	135.98236083984375

26075/28840	Too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks to behold Dantè	174.81524658203125
26076/28840	Hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse   As he thus reasoned Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la Caiss	972.240234375
26077/28840	It was the same through which twentyfour years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and	200.0009765625
26078/28840	And yet they were the same murmured Monte Cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so	150.32408142089844
26079/28840	He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue SaintLaurent and advanced to the Consigne it was the point where he had	88.80030059814453
26080/28840	A pleasureboat with striped awning was going	16608.16015625
26081/28840	Monte Cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good	146.69927978515625
26082/28840	The weather was magnificent and the excursion a	403.0381164550781
26083/28840	The sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming	943.736328125
26084/28840	Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantè	810.841796875
26085/28840	Clear sky swiftflitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the Château dIf seemed like the phantom of a mortal	226.4359130859375
26086/28840	As they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice   Sir we are at the	77.223876953125
26087/28840	Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayon	128.5574951171875
26088/28840	The journey had seemed very long to Dantès but Monte Cristo found it equally	60.00844192504883
26089/28840	Each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the	196.81285095214844
26090/28840	50219m       There had been no prisoners confined in the Château dIf since the revolution of July it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of	74.36002349853516
26091/28840	A concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of	334.5838928222656
26092/28840	The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other	153.45811462402344
26093/28840	The concierge who attended him had only been there since	241.94834899902344
26094/28840	He again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow	121.29671478271484
26095/28840	His eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had	139.08645629882812
26096/28840	Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of	164.7726287841797
26097/28840	Monte Cristo shuddered Antoine had been his jail	143.48587036132812
26098/28840	The count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concier	82.5943603515625
26099/28840	Would you like to hear the story sir   Yes relate it said Monte Cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own	93.36915588378906
26100/28840	This dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of	118.58025360107422
26101/28840	Another person was confined in the Château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad	64.42192077636719
26102/28840	Ah indeedmad repeated Monte Cristo and what was his mania   He offered millions to anyone who would set him at	148.19960021972656
26103/28840	Monte Cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firm	49.25804901123047
26104/28840	He thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria offered the	169.9304656982422
26105/28840	Could the prisoners see each other he	176.20254516601562
26106/28840	Oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the	251.3248291015625
26107/28840	And which of them made this passage   Oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an	134.79835510253906
26108/28840	However be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his	257.1732177734375
26109/28840	Do you see it and the man held the torch to the	58.819583892822266
26110/28840	50223m       Ah yes I see said the count in a voice hoarse from	29.75444221496582
26111/28840	The result was that the two men communicated with one another how long they did so nobody	241.03152465820312
26112/28840	One day the old man fell ill and	395.175537109375
26113/28840	Now guess what the young one did   Tell	261.4693603515625
26114/28840	He carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead	90.04082489013672
26115/28840	Did you ever hear of such an idea   Monte Cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his	78.25431060791016
26116/28840	The jailer continued   Now this was his	131.28892517089844
26117/28840	They never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannonball to the feet and then threw them into the	236.93374633789062
26118/28840	The count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of	126.71402740478516
26119/28840	No he muttered the doubt I felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for	885.78076171875
26120/28840	And the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards   Oh no of course	197.64610290527344
26121/28840	_Ma foi_ yes though he was in his own	57.73047637939453
26122/28840	What do you mean   The report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the Bonapart	41.66353988647461
26123/28840	Then the count added aloud Was his name ever known   Oh yes but only as	91.11084747314453
26124/28840	Oh Villefort Villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours   Do you wish to see anything more sir said the concier	59.813438415527344
26125/28840	Yes especially if you will show me the poor abbés	41.892757415771484
26126/28840	repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his	67.86528015136719
26127/28840	Wait said Monte Cristo I wish to take one final glance around this	52.43185806274414
26128/28840	This is fortunate said the guide I have forgotten the other	187.47723388671875
26129/28840	I will leave you the torch	123.61756134033203
26130/28840	No take it away I can see in the	70.16798400878906
26131/28840	They said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his	54.03487777709961
26132/28840	He spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the	365.4270935058594
26133/28840	Scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by	183.94369506835938
26134/28840	Then he looked around him and really recognized his	168.35162353515625
26135/28840	Yes he said there is the stone upon which I used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the	82.62138366699219
26136/28840	Oh those figures how well I remember them I made them one day to calculate the age of my father that I might know whether I should find him still living and that of Mercédès to know if I should find her still	65.8494644165039
26137/28840	After finishing that calculation I had a minutes	2052.098876953125
26138/28840	I did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the	226.23939514160156
26139/28840	He saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of Mercédè	51.54585266113281
26140/28840	Oh God thou hast preserved my memory I thank thee I thank thee   At this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall the guide was coming Monte Cristo went to meet	75.95249938964844
26141/28840	Follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another	251.92091369628906

26143/28840	The first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had	85.19854736328125
26144/28840	The sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his	124.9333267211914
26145/28840	This is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained un	130.35235595703125

26159/28840	I do not knowI only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners	170.4108428955078
26160/28840	And have you them yet   No sir I sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but I have still something	201.5012664794922
26161/28840	What is it asked the count impatient	45.5809211730957
26162/28840	A sort of book written upon strips of	3920.623291015625

26164/28840	I will run for it sir and the guide went	183.98641967773438

26170/28840	Ah he exclaimed here is my	72.64828491210938

26215/28840	Morrel accompanied the count to the	89.2376480102539
26216/28840	The white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chim	262.61553955078125

26218/28840	Peppino   At the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgiou a man travelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed the little town of Aquapend	168.60791015625
26219/28840	He was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting	188.5543212890625
26220/28840	This man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under	247.17747497558594
26221/28840	He might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a	84.52058410644531
26222/28840	Another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other Italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of Figaro served all possible linguistic	1114.1295166015625
26223/28840	_Allegro_ he called out to the postilions at every	1028.065185546875

26225/28840	Old Pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in	248.88101196289062
26226/28840	The traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of Thomson  French which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in	56.94501495361328
26227/28840	It was situated in the Via dei Banchi near	353.3263244628906
26228/28840	In Rome as everywhere else the arrival of a postchaise is an	171.51348876953125
26229/28840	Now as these street Arabs of Rome more fortunate than those of Paris understand every language more especially the French they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of Thomson 	408.289794921875
26230/28840	The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson  French that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers	44.150516510009766
26231/28840	He reached it before the carriage	228.4119873046875

26234/28840	An attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first	207.24850463867188
26235/28840	Whom shall I announce said the	2581.0712890625
26236/28840	A door opened through which the attendant and the baron	137.40353393554688
26237/28840	The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a	22.97304344177246
26238/28840	The clerk continued to write for the next five minutes the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motion	127.37744140625
26239/28840	Then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy   Ah ha he said here you are Peppino   Yes was the laconic	68.97470092773438
26240/28840	You have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman   There is no great merit due to me for we were informed of	152.8690185546875
26241/28840	_Pardieu_ he has come to draw but I dont know how much   You will know presently my	47.34280776977539
26242/28840	Very well only do not give me false information as you did the other	107.09447479248047
26243/28840	What do you meanof whom do you speak Was it the Englishman who carried off 3000 crowns from here the other day   50237m       No he really had 3000 crowns and we found	92.22269439697266
26244/28840	I mean the Russian prince who you said had 30000 livres and we only found 22	357.3921813964844
26245/28840	In that case he must either have paid his debts   A Russian do that   Or spent the money   Possibly after	202.6962432861328
26246/28840	But you must let me make my observations or the Frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the	304.5670166015625
26247/28840	Peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the attendant had gone	162.86532592773438
26248/28840	At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming count	209.23533630371094

26250/28840	On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo   Why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this   I told you we were informed	17.138315200805664
26251/28840	Then why do you apply to me   That I may be sure I have the right	31.627044677734375

26253/28840	Danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the	44.02530288696289
26254/28840	According to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the	50.53523635864258
26255/28840	Guides are useful people who will turn their hands to	1043.6142578125
26256/28840	Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of	14.135005950927734
26257/28840	The _cicerone_ reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coach	38.211936950683594
26258/28840	Will your excellency visit Saint Peters asked the _cicerone	52.56438446044922
26259/28840	I did not come to Rome to see said Danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile I came to touch and he rapped his pocketbook in which he had just placed a	46.348384857177734
26260/28840	Then your excellency is going   To the	18.266109466552734
26261/28840	Casa Pastrini said the _cicerone_ to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly	50.924217224121094
26262/28840	Danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his	91.95785522460938
26263/28840	Peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of _morra_ with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of Orviet	421.1864318847656
26264/28840	The next morning Danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at	84.65594482421875
26265/28840	He breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the Eternal City ordered posthorses at	361.5379638671875
26266/28840	But Danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting	94.54397583007812
26267/28840	The horses only arrived at two oclock and the _cicerone_ did not bring the passport till	32.96399688720703
26268/28840	All these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of Signor Pastrinis the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi were also not	206.14845275878906
26269/28840	The baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excell	135.8026123046875
26270/28840	As Danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your high	115.164306640625
26271/28840	Which road asked the postilion in	586.0924072265625
26272/28840	Signor Pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped	148.85740661621094
26273/28840	Danglars intended travelling to Venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to Vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of	111.10211181640625
26274/28840	He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began to	140.7436981201172
26275/28840	Danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next	102.90220642089844
26276/28840	_Non capisco_ do not understand was the	3714.82568359375

26278/28840	I will stop at the first postinghouse said Danglars to	86.31122589111328
26279/28840	He still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights	85.50244903564453
26280/28840	He was luxuriously stretched in a good English calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven	320.510986328125
26281/28840	But the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was _Non capisco	218.04287719726562
26282/28840	50241m       Danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting	43.22444152832031
26283/28840	Danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his	133.56362915039062
26284/28840	He intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the	288.8544921875
26285/28840	Danglars astonished opened the door but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled	67.3670425415039
26286/28840	Eh he said to the postilion eh _mio caro_   This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalc	315.45977783203125
26287/28840	Come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going   _Dentro la testa_ answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing	129.23345947265625
26288/28840	Danglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant Put in your head He was making rapid progress in	956.6578369140625

26291/28840	Danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the	36.95783615112305
26292/28840	Can I have been intercepted by French telegrams to the pontifical authorities   He resolved to end his	246.74752807617188
26293/28840	Where are you taking me he	97.14055633544922
26294/28840	_Dentro la testa_ replied the same voice with the same menacing	1049.9703369140625
26295/28840	Danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that	39.75876235961914
26296/28840	Decidedly said Danglars with the perspiration on his forehead I must be under	83.1343002319336
26297/28840	And he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to	84.85887145996094
26298/28840	He then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the	180.845703125
26299/28840	He understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to	243.6652374267578
26300/28840	Oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my	827.95068359375
26301/28840	The carriage continued to roll on with frightful	321.5509948730469
26302/28840	An hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road	227.14251708984375
26303/28840	At length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling	63.37701416015625
26304/28840	He remembered those interesting stories so little believed in Paris respecting Roman bandits he remembered the adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry Mademoiselle Eugé	88.40010070800781
26305/28840	Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel	3191.383056640625
26306/28840	On the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular	188.43099975585938
26307/28840	On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it	43.746315002441406
26308/28840	At the same time the door was	25.8714656829834
26309/28840	Danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak Italian he understood it very	115.50401306152344
26310/28840	More dead than alive he looked around	144.4093475341797
26311/28840	Four men surrounded him besides the post	319.04241943359375
26312/28840	_Di quà_ said one of the men descending a little path leading out of the Appian	517.8836669921875
26313/28840	Danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following	52.337398529052734
26314/28840	Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentin	152.87966918945312
26315/28840	After walking for about ten minutes during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the	103.88819885253906
26316/28840	He wished to speak but his tongue refused to	134.3343048095703
26317/28840	_Avanti_ said the same sharp and imperative	1516.751220703125
26318/28840	This time Danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speakers meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the	193.8934326171875
26319/28840	This guide was our friend Peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open	475.4847412109375
26320/28840	Peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy	527.84423828125
26321/28840	The voice and gesture of the man who followed Danglars ordered him to do the	41.999141693115234
26322/28840	There was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditt	77.31057739257812
26323/28840	Danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by	233.35345458984375
26324/28840	Notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna he slid down like Peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his	352.469482421875
26325/28840	As he touched the ground he opened his	19.76658821105957
26326/28840	50245m       The path was wide but	39.08489227294922
26327/28840	Peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a	223.72808837890625
26328/28840	Two other men descended after Danglars forming the rearguard and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two	277.0570068359375
26329/28840	The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the	117.82767486572266
26330/28840	A sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left	108.0631103515625
26331/28840	A friend a friend said Peppino but where is the captain   There said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched	97.89268493652344
26332/28840	Fine spoil captain fine spoil said Peppino in Italian and taking Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling	142.8694305419922
26333/28840	Is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading Plutarchs _Life of Alexander	561.8709106445312
26334/28840	At this rather impertinent order Peppino raised his torch to the face of Danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes	138.12942504882812
26335/28840	His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous	890.3851318359375
26336/28840	The man is tired said the captain conduct him to his	68.93120574951172
26337/28840	Oh murmured Danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards I see glistening in the	81.87325286865234
26338/28840	The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor	137.4553680419922
26339/28840	He no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led	1305.377197265625
26340/28840	At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six	65.57954406738281
26341/28840	Then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the	75.44798278808594
26342/28840	The cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the	2268.527587890625
26343/28840	A bed of dried grass covered with goatskins was placed in one	871.5665893554688
26344/28840	Danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of	261.4671325683594
26345/28840	Oh God be praised he said it is a real bed   This was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of	105.9617691040039
26346/28840	He had not done so for ten years	33.6939811706543
26347/28840	_Ecco_ said the guide and pushing Danglars into the cell he closed the door upon	131.6254119873047
26348/28840	A bolt grated and Danglars was a	85.6508560180664
26349/28840	If there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of	44.88010787963867

26351/28840	These recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquill	89.38196563720703
26352/28840	Since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at	48.207759857177734
26353/28840	They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be rans	153.79965209960938
26354/28840	He remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his own price at 8000 crown	200.8887176513672
26355/28840	Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48000 livres he would then have about 5050000 francs	391.7608947753906
26356/28840	With this sum he could manage to keep out of	240.1708221435547

26358/28840	But in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into	649.8526000976562
26359/28840	Yes yes he murmured I am in the hands of the brigands of whom Albert de Morcerf	25.664901733398438
26360/28840	His first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was	120.32328033447266
26361/28840	He borrowed this from _Don Quixote_ the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly	902.0989379882812
26362/28840	No he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his	64.70616912841797
26363/28840	They were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little notecase containing his letter of credit for 5050000 franc	284.0054626464844
26364/28840	Singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocket	286.2422180175781
26365/28840	As I was saying last night they intend me to be rans	1388.358642578125
26366/28840	Hello here is my watch Let me see what time it	85.880859375
26367/28840	Danglars watch one of Breguets repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past	588.2695922851562
26368/28840	Without this Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his	51.99862289428711
26369/28840	Should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it The last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o	243.55313110351562
26370/28840	During all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his	46.634925842285156
26371/28840	50249m       Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over	31.992698669433594
26372/28840	Faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his	235.86007690429688
26373/28840	At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and Danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door	175.56900024414062
26374/28840	He was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and a flat nose his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his	1283.443359375
26375/28840	But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting	1240.4488525390625
26376/28840	He got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his	39.113807678222656
26377/28840	Danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his	28.306110382080078
26378/28840	Danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goatskin and did not breathe another	199.95272827148438
26379/28840	Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another band	229.45680236816406
26380/28840	Danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his	172.48291015625
26381/28840	It was indeed Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chickpeas stewed with	740.8256225585938
26382/28840	Near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a flask of Orviet	1389.95166015625
26383/28840	Danglars watched these preparations and his mouth	49.79166793823242
26384/28840	Come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other and he tapped gently at the	55.26326370239258
26385/28840	_On y va_ coming exclaimed Peppino who from frequenting the house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its idi	789.3958740234375
26386/28840	Then he added aloud Yes sir I am hungryvery	204.56536865234375
26387/28840	And your excellency wants something to eat   At once if possible   Nothing easier said Pepp	52.10329818725586
26388/28840	Here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest	978.6095581054688
26389/28840	Although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed	601.2318115234375
26390/28840	That is not the custom excellency said Pepp	48.82782745361328
26391/28840	A bad reason replied Danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but I am	229.82472229003906
26392/28840	Let me have some dinner   At once What would your excellency like   And Peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of Dangl	58.95067596435547
26393/28840	Have you kitchens here   Kitchensof coursecomplete	20686.58203125

26395/28840	You mentioned a fowl I think   Yes a f	140.9165496826172
26396/28840	Peppino turning around shouted A fowl for his excellency His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and halfnaked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his	266.3329772949219
26397/28840	I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris murmured Dangl	33.740821838378906
26398/28840	Here your excellency said Peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the wormeaten table which with the stool and the goatskin bed formed the entire furniture of the	100.39129638671875
26399/28840	Danglars asked for a knife and	68.0031509399414
26400/28840	Here excellency said Peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood	359.1915588378906
26401/28840	Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the f	30.818382263183594
26402/28840	Pardon me excellency said Peppino placing his hand on the bankers shoulder people pay here before they	102.31204986572266
26403/28840	They might not be satisfied and   Ah ha thought Danglars this is not so much like Paris except that I shall probably be skinned Never mind Ill fix that all	190.1237030029297
26404/28840	I have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy I should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at	273.50970458984375
26405/28840	There he said throwing a louis	52.85445022583008
26406/28840	Peppino picked up the louis and Danglars again prepared to carve the f	51.64435958862305
26407/28840	Stay a moment your excellency said Peppino rising you still owe me	40.8948974609375
26408/28840	I said they would skin me thought Danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said Come how much do I owe you for this fowl   Your excellency has given me a louis on	53.45931625366211
26409/28840	A louis on account for a fowl   Certainly and your excellency now owes me 4999 lou	253.10272216796875
26410/28840	Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic	64.8857421875
26411/28840	Very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when Peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other	110.69361877441406
26412/28840	Is it not a joke said Dangl	36.78152847290039
26413/28840	We never joke replied Peppino solemn as a Qu	270.3260803222656
26414/28840	Stay here is another louis for	95.60653686523438
26415/28840	Then that will make only 4998 louis more said Peppino with the same	554.0545654296875
26416/28840	I shall get them all in	88.54884338378906
26417/28840	Oh as for that said Danglars angry at this prolongation of the jestas for that you wont get them at	146.59906005859375
26418/28840	Go to the devil You do not know with whom you have to deal   50253m       Peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the f	43.54047393798828
26419/28840	Danglars threw himself upon his goatskin and Peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and	439.40460205078125
26420/28840	Though Danglars could not see Peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his	67.76830291748047
26421/28840	He was certainly eating and noisily too like an illbred	547.1454467773438
26422/28840	Peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat	157.97354125976562
26423/28840	Danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another halfhour which appeared to him like a	82.62693786621094
26424/28840	He again arose and went to the	31.117515563964844
26425/28840	Come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they	82.6924057006836
26426/28840	Nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you	30.733352661132812

26428/28840	Now look here I want something to eat To eatdo you hear   Are you hungry   Come you understand	125.71599578857422
26429/28840	What would your excellency like to eat   A piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed	118.2593002319336
26430/28840	Four thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight louis said Peppino You have paid two louis in	198.06460571289062

26432/28840	But you only asked 100000 francs for a fowl   We have a fixed price for all our	119.60600280761719
26433/28840	It signifies nothing whether you eat much or littlewhether you have ten dishes or oneit is always the same	1078.3231201171875

26435/28840	Oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit	133.24867248535156
26436/28840	And what am I to pay with brute said Danglars	108.07393646240234
26437/28840	Do you suppose I carry 100000 francs in my pocket   Your excellency has 5050000 francs in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at 100000 francs apiece and half a fowl for the 5	51.79368591308594
26438/28840	The bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just	62.31770324707031
26439/28840	Come he said if I pay you the 100000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease   Certainly said Pepp	34.55657958984375

26442/28840	Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper Peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed	60.76074981689453
26443/28840	Here he said here is a draft at	137.58102416992188
26444/28840	Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had	139.36317443847656
26445/28840	As for Peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his	94.14324188232422
26446/28840	The Pardon   The next day Danglars was again hungry certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of	149.91970825195312
26447/28840	The prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his	128.2747039794922
26448/28840	But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten	178.57420349121094
26449/28840	He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called	270.6312255859375

26451/28840	He thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for Pepp	61.322105407714844
26452/28840	Here I am your excellency said Peppino with an eagerness which Danglars thought favorable to	30.381935119628906
26453/28840	What do you want   Something to	59.94178009033203
26454/28840	Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near	389.12384033203125
26455/28840	Then give me water cried Danglars endeavoring to parry the	77.7728042602539
26456/28840	Oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellencythere has been such a	347.02777099609375
26457/28840	Come thought Danglars it is the same old	52.050655364990234
26458/28840	And while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with pers	192.89813232421875
26459/28840	Come my friend said Danglars seeing that he made no impression on Peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine   I have already told you that we do not sell at	25.746057510375977
26460/28840	Well then let me have a bottle of the least	140.05052185058594
26461/28840	And what is that   Twentyfive thousand francs a	30.931964874267578

26463/28840	It is possible such may be the masters	745.9036254882812
26464/28840	The masterwho is he   The person to whom you were conducted	99.04670715332031
26465/28840	And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Dangl	42.60541915893555
26466/28840	You sent for me he said to the	41.9101676940918

26468/28840	What then   How much do you require for my ransom   Merely the 5000000 you have about	98.22756958007812
26469/28840	Danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his	116.44684600830078
26470/28840	But this is all I have left in the world he said out of an immense	44.66497802734375
26471/28840	If you deprive me of that take away my life	193.4259033203125
26472/28840	We are forbidden to shed your	303.70733642578125
26473/28840	And by whom are you forbidden   By him we	205.85122680664062
26474/28840	You do then obey someone   Yes a	227.7549591064453
26475/28840	I thought you said you were the chief   So I am of these men but there is another over	93.44263458251953
26476/28840	And did your superior order you to treat me in this way  	69.57381439208984
26477/28840	Come said Danglars will you take a million  	12.066390037536621
26478/28840	Two millionsthreefour Come four I will give them to you on condition that you let me	322.36053466796875
26479/28840	Why do you offer me 4000000 for what is worth 5000000 This is a kind of usury banker that I do not	460.7051086425781
26480/28840	Take all thentake all I tell you and kill me   Come come calm	276.94580078125
26481/28840	You will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to	112.60112762451172
26482/28840	But when I have no more money left to pay you asked the infuriated Dangl	64.9482650756836
26483/28840	But you say you do not wish to kill me  	14.772624015808105
26484/28840	And yet you will let me perish with hunger   Ah that is a different	34.13718032836914
26485/28840	Danglars raving threw himself on the goats	96.81256103515625
26486/28840	Danglars meditated an escape but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually	358.3963623046875
26487/28840	His resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some	338.8334045410156
26488/28840	They sent him a magnificent supper and took his	718.02587890625
26489/28840	From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he	136.68014526367188
26490/28840	At the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50000 francs	57.89957809448242
26491/28840	Three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not	1050.5081787109375
26492/28840	Sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of	71.36080932617188
26493/28840	On the fourth he was no longer a man but a living	53.27593994140625
26494/28840	He had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his	236.73138427734375
26495/28840	Then he entreated Peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him 1000 francs for a mouthful of	168.76844787597656
26496/28840	On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the	45.1577033996582
26497/28840	Are you not a Christian he said falling on his	53.475135803222656
26498/28840	Do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of Heaven is a brother Oh my former friends my former friends he murmured and fell with his face to the	81.6318359375
26499/28840	Yes those who have died of	58.214839935302734
26500/28840	Danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his	25.297155380249023
26501/28840	He struck his forehead on the ground and gro	84.78872680664062
26502/28840	Yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than I have but then they must have been martyrs at	87.6480712890625
26503/28840	Do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused Danglars hair to stand on	257.7466735839844
26504/28840	His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone	102.51407623291016
26505/28840	Of what must I repent stammered Dangl	68.30120849609375
26506/28840	Of the evil you have done said the	80.5464859008789
26507/28840	Oh yes oh yes I do indeed	254.8968048095703
26508/28840	And he struck his breast with his emaciated	977.8440551757812
26509/28840	Then I forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the	85.73937225341797
26510/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo said Danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and	47.05942153930664
26511/28840	You are mistakenI am not the Count of Monte Crist	12.864544868469238
26512/28840	Rise said the count your life is safe the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplicesone is mad the other	109.78465270996094
26513/28840	Keep the 50000 francs you have leftI give them to	49.660770416259766
26514/28840	The 5000000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown	1262.0509033203125
26515/28840	And now eat and drink I will entertain you	351.8117370605469
26516/28840	Vampa when this man is satisfied let him be	175.8068389892578
26517/28840	Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits	118.73567962646484
26518/28840	According to the counts directions Danglars was waited on by Vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of Italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the postchaise left him leaning against a	65.3353042602539
26519/28840	He remained there all night not knowing where he	197.9003448486328
26520/28840	When daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream he was thirsty and dragged himself towards	113.67030334472656
26521/28840	As he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely	98.25230407714844
26522/28840	The Fifth of October   It was about six oclock in the evening an opalcolored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue	200.6697540283203
26523/28840	The heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the	824.9364013671875
26524/28840	A delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the Mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the	572.2188720703125
26525/28840	A light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles and from Tunis to	923.6149291992188
26526/28840	The vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the	252.50143432617188
26527/28840	It advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of	1061.57080078125
26528/28840	The yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young	204.4882354736328
26529/28840	Standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a	78.67267608642578
26530/28840	Is that Monte Cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy	151.36502075195312
26531/28840	Yes your excellency said the captain we have reached	21.321958541870117
26532/28840	We have reached it repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable	81.14350891113281
26533/28840	Then he added in a low tone Yes that is the	86.30476379394531
26534/28840	And then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by	105.62574768066406
26535/28840	A few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the	88.74413299560547
26536/28840	Your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself   What signal   The captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it	126.01493835449219
26537/28840	Ah yes he said as if awaking from a	104.13792419433594
26538/28840	The captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the	137.40032958984375
26539/28840	Ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little	93.94203186035156
26540/28840	The gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxsw	594.2252807617188
26541/28840	The traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms	151.40538024902344
26542/28840	The rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their	854.7554321289062
26543/28840	50265m       Give way said the	29.085853576660156
26544/28840	The eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided	282.68975830078125
26545/28840	In an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine	283.3233337402344
26546/28840	Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men they will carry you ashore The young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat the sea immediately rose to his	92.25831604003906
26547/28840	Ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for	68.61062622070312
26548/28840	The young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm	346.9329528808594
26549/28840	Thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite	191.36715698242188
26550/28840	Yes you see I am as exact as you	24.881290435791016
26551/28840	But you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as Calypso said to Telem	1797.6937255859375
26552/28840	Come I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and	99.98394012451172
26553/28840	Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a	76.39290618896484
26554/28840	Already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the	48.6782112121582
26555/28840	Oh yes said the count you are looking for the	32.39151382446289
26556/28840	Yes I paid them nothing and yet they are	88.767578125
26557/28840	Never mind that Maximilian said Monte Cristo	18.386024475097656
26558/28840	I have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all	322.92022705078125
26559/28840	Morrel looked at the count with	11.699494361877441
26560/28840	Count he said you are not the same here as in	40.012393951416016
26561/28840	How so   Here you	185.02967834472656

26565/28840	You are wrong Morrel I was really	137.2594757080078
26566/28840	Then you forget me so much the	33.176025390625
26567/28840	How so   Yes for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena He who is about to die salutes	170.92990112304688
26568/28840	Then you are not consoled asked the count	136.9164276123047

26570/28840	Do you understand the meaning of my words You cannot take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless	297.52960205078125
26571/28840	When I ask you if you are consoled I speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no	54.90986251831055
26572/28840	Well Morrel let us both examine the depths of your	99.67091369628906
26573/28840	Count said Morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth I come to die in the arms of a	56.869659423828125
26574/28840	Certainly there are people whom I	112.36212158203125
26575/28840	I love my sister JulieI love her husband Emmanuel but I require a strong mind to smile on my last	85.73143005371094
26576/28840	My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting I could not bear to see her	90.87749481201172
26577/28840	Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house with his	267.7449645996094
26578/28840	No I feel that I have reached the goal and I will go no	55.91444396972656

26582/28840	Oh count I shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of	541.803955078125
26583/28840	Morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count	39.71187210083008
26584/28840	My friend continued Morrel you named the fifth of October as the end of the period of waitingtoday is the fifth of October he took out his watch it is now nine oclockI have yet three hours to	186.57943725585938
26585/28840	Be it so said the count	129.10841369628906
26586/28840	Morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived	78.62789916992188
26587/28840	He felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his	241.90602111816406
26588/28840	Morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he	484.7754211425781

26590/28840	He sat down and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to	28.850093841552734
26591/28840	They were in the marvellous diningroom before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and	173.48692321777344
26592/28840	Morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed	106.32836151123047
26593/28840	Let us talk like men he said looking at the	74.6778335571289
26594/28840	Go on   Count said Morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than	161.17111206054688

26597/28840	I am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die   Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tender	26.272254943847656
26598/28840	Yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for	649.3109130859375

26604/28840	Thanks the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer is sweet to my	151.570068359375
26605/28840	Do you then regret nothing   No replied Mor	45.715091705322266

26623/28840	Yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure	107.9244384765625
26624/28840	He placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret	105.01626586914062
26625/28840	This box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the	235.0989990234375
26626/28840	It was a mixed mass of blue red and	329.4387512207031
26627/28840	The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to Morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon	133.72900390625
26628/28840	It was then observable that the substance was green	529.7822875976562
26629/28840	This is what you asked for he said and what I promised to give	62.83474349975586
26630/28840	I thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of Monte Crist	21.005298614501953
26631/28840	The count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden	410.9338073730469
26632/28840	What are you going to do my friend asked Morrel arresting his	34.51640701293945
26633/28840	Well the fact is Morrel I was thinking that I too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself   Stay said the young	68.02919006347656

26635/28840	In your case it would be a	76.15773010253906
26636/28840	Adieu my noble and generous friend adieu I will go and tell Valentine what you have done for	61.235084533691406
26637/28840	And slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the counts hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by Monte Crist	273.9119873046875

26639/28840	By degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Mor	117.2108154296875
26640/28840	Seated opposite to him Monte Cristo watched him in the shadow and Morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the	29.683706283569336
26641/28840	An overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the	398.7796936035156
26642/28840	50273m       Friend he cried I feel that I am dying thanks   He made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside	48.189292907714844
26643/28840	Then it appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a	51.04482650756836
26644/28840	At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging	163.06317138671875
26645/28840	Morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every	1111.0418701171875
26646/28840	A change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleid	886.6145629882812
26647/28840	Enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding	551.3126831054688
26648/28840	He wished once again to press the counts hand but his own was imm	194.1015625

26650/28840	Involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a wellknown form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself envelop	305.55499267578125
26651/28840	The count had just opened a	73.44697570800781
26652/28840	Immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last	275.3885803222656
26653/28840	Then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two	81.61237335205078
26654/28840	Pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of	864.8277587890625

26711/28840	A short time ago while making researches in the Royal Library for my History of Louis	1353.795166015625
26712/28840	I stumbled by chance upon the Memoirs of	2133.3955078125
26713/28840	dArtagnan printedas were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence more or less long in the Bastilleat Amsterdam by Pierre	794.9846801757812

26762/28840	DArtagnan was a woman and still more a	40.736236572265625
26763/28840	She wept abundantly andlet us speak it to the praise of	605.8508911132812

26768/28840	DArtagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of Me	461.1688537597656
26769/28840	DArtagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and	60.80089569091797
26770/28840	This time DArtagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse	62.32444763183594
26771/28840	The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as I have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of	265.2677001953125
26772/28840	Now as a halfsmile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily	206.74560546875
26773/28840	Nevertheless DArtagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed	59.08271789550781
26774/28840	He fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to fortyfive years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and wellshaped	172.58937072753906
26775/28840	He was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt	370.5018310546875
26776/28840	This doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmante	897.0942993164062
26777/28840	DArtagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future	67.61216735839844
26778/28840	This time there could be no doubt DArtagnan was really	37.59273910522461
26779/28840	Unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious	252.7548828125
26780/28840	But I am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and	153.67897033691406
26781/28840	The stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of DArtagn	48.446598052978516
26782/28840	His quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the	37.93623352050781

26787/28840	But DArtagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule	93.4997787475586
26788/28840	He drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying Turn turn Master Joker lest I strike you behind   Strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as	324.373046875
26789/28840	Why my good fellow you must be mad Then in a suppressed tone as if speaking to himself This is annoying continued	174.87159729003906

26793/28840	When he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of	53.6123046875
26794/28840	But the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with DArtagnan was not the man ever to cry for	119.88922119140625
26795/28840	The fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length DArtagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a	118.21723937988281

26805/28840	Why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the	178.5748748779297

26823/28840	That is well do as I have directed you	172.00587463378906
26824/28840	What the devil said the host to	24.93548583984375
26825/28840	Can he be afraid of this boy But an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short he bowed humbly and	310.98321533203125
26826/28840	It is not necessary for Milady to be seen by this fellow continued the	76.00434875488281
26827/28840	She will soon pass she is already	379.1404724121094
26828/28840	I had better get on horseback and go and meet	68.63275146484375
26829/28840	I should like however to know what this letter addressed to Tréville	148.1761932373047
26830/28840	And the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the	188.6808624267578
26831/28840	We are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family	512.7612915039062
26832/28840	But we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter	112.87437438964844
26833/28840	In the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry reascended to his wifes chamber and found DArtagnan just recovering his	122.64111328125
26834/28840	His interlocutor whose head appeared through the carriage window was a woman of from twenty to twoandtwenty	137.49005126953125
26835/28840	We have already observed with what rapidity DArtagnan seized the expression of a count	33.52118682861328
26836/28840	He perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which DArtagnan had hitherto	155.76283264160156
26837/28840	She was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alab	350.5205383300781

26839/28840	His Eminence then orders me said the	1337.232666015625
26840/28840	To return instantly to England and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves	113.26715850830078
26841/28840	And as to my other instructions asked the fair	340.8296203613281
26842/28840	They are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the	51.96480941772461
26843/28840	Very well and youwhat will you do   II return to	59.70396423339844
26844/28840	What without chastising this insolent boy asked the	2000.303466796875
26845/28840	The stranger was about to reply but at the moment he opened his mouth DArtagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the	35.03135299682617
26846/28840	This insolent boy chastises others cried he and I hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as	307.4242248535156
26847/28840	Will not escape him replied the stranger knitting his	264.8998718261719
26848/28840	No before a woman you would dare not fly I presume   Remember said Milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin	186.42514038085938
26849/28840	You are right cried the gentleman begone then on your part and I will depart as quickly on	235.8657989501953
26850/28840	And bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his	138.97702026367188
26851/28840	The two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gall	836.5243530273438
26852/28840	Pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his	236.84779357910156
26853/28840	Base coward false gentleman cried DArtagnan springing forward in his turn after the	94.77937316894531
26854/28840	But his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exert	166.91903686523438
26855/28840	Yes a base coward murmured DArtagnan but sheshe was very	125.51713562011719
26856/28840	Milady faltered DArtagnan and fainted a second	133.8100128173828
26857/28840	Ah its all one said the host I have lost two customers but this one remains of whom I am pretty certain for some days to	137.2095489501953
26858/28840	It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in DArtagnans	154.41697692871094
26859/28840	The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his	298.7982177734375
26860/28840	Hence it resulted when DArtagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabb	113.4486083984375
26861/28840	As to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding	232.59547424316406
26862/28840	But this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly	353.2303161621094
26863/28840	But after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter   Yes where is this letter cried DArtagn	53.99343490600586
26864/28840	In the first place I warn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find	28.155704498291016
26865/28840	His threat completed the intimidation of the	2353.2197265625
26866/28840	After the king and the cardinal	56.14525604248047
26867/28840	de Tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by	164.94361877441406
26868/28840	There was to be sure Father Joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence as the cardinals familiar was	396.1165771484375
26869/28840	Throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost	571.7225341796875
26870/28840	Does the letter contain anything valuable demanded the host after a few minutes of useless	418.53350830078125
26871/28840	Zounds I think it does indeed cried the Gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at	139.10728454589844
26872/28840	It contained my fortune   Bills upon Spain asked the disturbed	1437.9854736328125
26873/28840	Bills upon his Majestys private treasury answered DArtagnan who reckoning upon entering into the kings service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a	558.503662109375
26874/28840	The devil cried the host at his wits	278.81805419921875
26875/28840	But its of no importance continued DArtagnan with natural assurance its of no	555.79541015625
26876/28840	The money is nothing that letter was	467.5470886230469
26877/28840	I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost	51.05052185058594
26878/28840	He would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained	423.54119873046875
26879/28840	A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding	163.2770538330078
26880/28840	That letter is not lost cried	436.8443298339844
26881/28840	No it has been stolen from	84.48282623291016
26882/28840	Stolen By whom   By the gentleman who was here	149.64552307128906
26883/28840	He came down into the kitchen where your doublet	99.58654022216797
26884/28840	I would lay a wager he has stolen	107.0324935913086
26885/28840	Do you think so answered DArtagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cup	148.52529907226562
26886/28840	The fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this	183.4182586669922

26891/28840	Thus the dealer to whom DArtagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his	74.988525390625
26892/28840	Thus DArtagnan entered Paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his	202.73326110839844
26893/28840	This chamber was a sort of garret situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs near the	239.9127197265625

26895/28840	Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the Louvre inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of	127.93245697021484
26896/28840	de Tréville which proved to be in the Rue du VieuxColombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by DArtagnana circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his	149.15887451171875
26897/28840	After this satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at Meung without remorse for the past confident in the present and full of hope for the future he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the	123.18782806396484

26902/28840	His insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor which he had climbed four steps at a	625.9909057617188
26903/28840	He was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father Henry	133.26760864257812
26904/28840	This was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth so that when the illustrious companion of the great Henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his	144.38958740234375
26905/28840	Thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it	305.0411071777344
26906/28840	de Tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that Louis	129.06028747558594
26907/28840	one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and Tréville nextor even perhaps before	164.788818359375

26911/28840	In short up to this period nothing had been wanting to Tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his	163.1804656982422
26912/28840	made Tréville the captain of his Musketeers who were to Louis	67.63716125488281
26913/28840	in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his Ordinaries had been to Henry	3896.31689453125
26914/28840	and his Scotch Guard to Louis	27638.97265625
26915/28840	On his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this	127.09053039550781
26916/28840	When he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis	399.7437744140625
26917/28840	had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of France became desirous that he too should have his	266.8348388671875
26918/28840	He had his Musketeers therefore as Louis	207.0339813232422
26919/28840	had his and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring not only from all the provinces of France but even from all foreign states the most celebrated swords	362.79827880859375
26920/28840	It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis	71.24595642089844
26921/28840	to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their	672.1258544921875
26922/28840	Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own	626.9605712890625
26923/28840	While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own	1318.5992431640625
26924/28840	We learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these	478.5162048339844
26925/28840	Tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his	178.11013793945312
26926/28840	He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand Duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his Eminence curl with	715.01513671875

26932/28840	de Tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the kingand then for himself and his own	104.23668670654297
26933/28840	For the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the	248.9813232421875
26934/28840	In no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his	1722.9794921875

26941/28840	The court of his hôtel situated in the Rue du VieuxColombier resembled a camp from by six oclock in the morning in summer and eight oclock in	219.3588409423828
26942/28840	From fifty to sixty Musketeers who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number paraded constantly armed to the teeth and ready for	452.14617919921875
26943/28840	In the antechamber upon long circular benches reposed the elect that is to say those who were	210.02792358398438
26944/28840	In this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night while	2961.0126953125
26945/28840	de Tréville in his office contiguous to this antechamber received visits listened to complaints gave his orders and like the king in his balcony at the Louvre had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and	193.322265625
26946/28840	The day on which DArtagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his	281.2564697265625
26947/28840	It is true that this provincial was a Gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of DArtagnan had the reputation of not being easily	129.92578125
26948/28840	When he had once passed the massive door covered with long squareheaded nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with	258.61346435546875

26950/28840	Arrived at the staircase it was still	238.91015625
26951/28840	There were four Musketeers on the bottom steps amusing themselves with the following exercise while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the	324.6809997558594

26953/28840	These three others fenced against him with their agile	3534.716064453125

26956/28840	In five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intacta piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of	594.8285522460938
26957/28840	However difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished	370.2642822265625
26958/28840	He had seen in his provincethat land in which heads become so easily heateda few of the preliminaries of duels but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in Gascon	473.620849609375
26959/28840	He believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which Gulliver afterward went and was so frightened and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the antech	477.3700866699219
26960/28840	On the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the	170.1828155517578

26962/28840	But if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antech	239.30442810058594
26963/28840	There to his great astonishment DArtagnan heard the policy which made all Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry	223.93856811523438
26964/28840	That great man who was so revered by DArtagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked	179.2793731689453

26967/28840	They looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of	114.89110565185547
26968/28840	de Tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his	199.0135955810547

26972/28840	At this demand DArtagnan gave his name very modestly emphasized the title of compatriot and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moments audience of	308.2560729980469

26975/28840	The center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general	134.4453582763672
26976/28840	A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rap	1288.7222900390625
26977/28840	This Musketeer had just come off guard complained of having a cold and coughed from time to time affected	408.36279296875
26978/28840	It was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and DArtagnan more than	102.15084075927734
26979/28840	What would you have said the Musket	81.03914642333984
26980/28840	It is a folly I admit but still it is the	220.07452392578125
26981/28840	Besides one must lay out ones inheritance	3613.21484375
26982/28840	Ah Porthos cried one of his companions dont try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal	295.27545166015625
26983/28840	It was given to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday near the gate	271.6154479980469
26984/28840	No upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman I bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name Porth	131.85382080078125
26985/28840	Yes about in the same manner said another Musketeer that I bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old	222.01158142089844
26986/28840	Its true though said Porthos and the proof is that I paid twelve pistoles for	112.63114929199219
26987/28840	The wonder was increased though the doubt continued to	1864.992919921875
26988/28840	Is it not true Aramis said Porthos turning toward another Musket	71.78765869140625
26989/28840	This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of Aram	90.41289520263672
26990/28840	He was a stout man of about two or threeandtwenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn	268.3614501953125
26991/28840	His delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink	521.2766723632812
26992/28840	Habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great	461.828369140625
26993/28840	He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the	336.1792907714844
26994/28840	This affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the bald	1270.0772705078125
26995/28840	They continued to admire it but said no more about it and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another	186.12625122070312
26996/28840	What do you think of the story Chalaiss esquire relates asked another Musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to	505.6356201171875
26997/28840	And what does he say asked Porthos in a selfsufficient	111.69210052490234
26998/28840	He relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort the _âme damnée_ of the cardinal disguised as a Capuchin and that this cursed Rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked Monsieur de Laigues like a ninny as he	734.1297607421875
26999/28840	A ninny indeed said Porthos but is the matter certain   I had it from Aramis replied the Musket	147.23033142089844
27000/28840	Indeed   Why you knew it Porthos said Aram	15.484415054321289
27001/28840	Let us say no more about	78.19496154785156
27002/28840	Say no more about it Thats _your_ opinion replied Porth	212.0688934326172
27003/28840	Say no more about it _Peste_ You come to your conclusions	280.94964599609375
27004/28840	You unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today Let us say no more about	125.22038269042969
27005/28840	Well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied Aramis	68.28189849853516
27006/28840	This Rochefort cried Porthos if I were the esquire of poor Chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with	236.9394073486328
27007/28840	And youyou would pass rather a sad quarterhour with the Red Duke replied Aram	1706.5087890625

27011/28840	You very well know Porthos that I continue to study theology for that	118.53802490234375
27012/28840	He will be one as he says cried Porthos he will be one sooner or	53.98112106323242
27013/28840	He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another Musket	284.7884826660156
27014/28840	What is he waiting for asked	264.893798828125
27015/28840	Only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of	83.55603790283203
27016/28840	Aramis my good friend this time you are wrong interrupted Porth	26.372032165527344
27017/28840	Your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if Monsieur de Tréville heard you you would repent of speaking	374.56988525390625
27018/28840	Are you going to give me a lesson Porthos cried Aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like	133.91616821289062

27046/28840	To save yourselves to scamper away to fleethat is good for the kings Musketeers   Porthos and Aramis trembled with	206.92689514160156
27047/28840	de Tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak	104.4889907836914
27048/28840	They stamped upon the carpet with their feet they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their	201.3039093017578

27053/28840	de Tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his aud	446.6205749511719
27054/28840	At these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphem	296.34942626953125

27057/28840	Well my Captain said Porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against	239.61660766601562
27058/28840	But we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and Athos grievously wounded was very little	202.30662536621094
27059/28840	Well Captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again	734.9567260742188
27060/28840	And we did not surrenderno They dragged us away by	683.3743896484375
27061/28840	As for Athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him	81.46415710449219

27065/28840	I did not know that replied	39.74559020996094
27066/28840	de Tréville in a somewhat softened	124.70050048828125

27074/28840	de Tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that Athos whatever might be his selfcommand allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was	77.6109390258789
27075/28840	The door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of Athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to	149.34376525878906
27076/28840	A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapest	94.5304946899414
27077/28840	de Tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of Athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were	160.79014587402344

27079/28840	de Tréville the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet he not thinking to shut the door against anyone and all crowded round the wounded	136.28285217285156
27080/28840	But all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hô	189.76214599609375
27081/28840	He pushed through the crowd approached Athos still insensible and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly he required as the first and most urgent thing that the Musketeer should be carried into an adjoining	161.53948974609375
27082/28840	de Tréville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis who bore their comrade in their	75.73648071289062
27083/28840	Behind this group walked the surgeon and behind the surgeon the door	678.8391723632812

27086/28840	An instant after Porthos and Aramis reentered the surgeon and	47.29543685913086
27087/28840	de Tréville alone remaining with the	433.3712463378906
27088/28840	The injured man had recovered his	510.9620361328125
27089/28840	The surgeon declared that the situation of the Musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of	228.4801788330078
27090/28840	de Tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except DArtagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a Gascon remained in his	38.685279846191406
27091/28840	When all had gone out and the door was closed	66.90095520019531
27092/28840	de Tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young	110.301025390625
27093/28840	The event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his	161.61053466796875
27094/28840	He inquired what was the will of his persevering	575.5939331054688
27095/28840	DArtagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past	65.54293060302734
27096/28840	Pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but I had wholly forgotten	276.4233093261719
27097/28840	But what help is there for it A captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary	184.92665100097656
27098/28840	Soldiers are big children but as I maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed   DArtagnan could not restrain a	85.7974853515625
27099/28840	de Tréville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the	149.00411987304688
27100/28840	I respected your father very much said	379.97064208984375
27101/28840	What can I do for the son Tell me quickly my time is not my	204.15628051757812
27102/28840	It is indeed a favor young man replied	229.9656982421875
27103/28840	de Tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to	65.50956726074219
27104/28840	But his majestys decision is always necessary and I inform you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than	311.6118469238281
27105/28840	DArtagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the Musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of	463.3645324707031
27106/28840	de Tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as I have said I will do something for you young	109.10438537597656
27107/28840	Our recruits from Béarn are not generally very rich and I have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since I left the	358.0902099609375
27108/28840	I dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you   DArtagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said I ask alms of no	69.4004898071289
27109/28840	Oh thats very well young man continued	601.313232421875
27110/28840	I know these airs I myself came to Paris with four crowns in my purse and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me I was not in a condition to purchase the Lou	102.4768295288086
27111/28840	Thanks to the sale of his horse he commenced his career with four more crowns than	132.13792419433594
27112/28840	de Tréville possessed at the commencement of	67.25064086914062
27113/28840	You ought I say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a	325.45489501953125
27114/28840	I will write a letter today to the Director of the Royal Academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to	301.57080078125
27115/28840	Our bestborn and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain	720.6729125976562
27116/28840	You will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and	3544.46826171875
27117/28840	You will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether I can be of further service to	71.84033203125
27118/28840	DArtagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this	150.126220703125
27119/28840	Alas sir said he I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to	68.63218688964844
27120/28840	de Tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor Béarn	712.218017578125
27121/28840	I had one sir and thank God such as I could wish cried DArtagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from	196.6642608642578
27122/28840	He then related the adventure of Meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted	318.16387939453125
27123/28840	This is all very strange said	77.7089614868164
27124/28840	de Tréville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud   Yes sir I certainly committed that imprudence but why should I have done otherwise A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my	208.898681640625
27125/28840	Judge if I should not put myself under its	203.55691528320312
27126/28840	Flattery was at that period very current and	1350.6505126953125
27127/28840	de Tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a	311.2304992675781
27128/28840	Was he not a finelooking man  	98.44580078125
27129/28840	He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he	302.4363098144531
27130/28840	You know not the subject of their conversation   He gave her a box told her not to open it except in	129.32998657226562
27131/28840	Was this woman English   He called her Mil	358.48675537109375
27132/28840	It is he it must be he murmured Tré	64.8418197631836
27133/28840	Oh sir if you know who this man is cried DArtagnan tell me who he is and whence he	39.25703811645508
27134/28840	I will then release you from all your promiseseven that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers for before everything I wish to avenge	183.58599853515625
27135/28840	If you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the	60.885929107666016
27136/28840	Do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like	419.6202087402344
27137/28840	That will not prevent me replied DArtagnan if ever I find	28.94820785522461
27138/28840	In the meantime said Tréville seek him notif I have a right to advise	165.92138671875
27139/28840	All at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden	133.96400451660156
27140/28840	He was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected	650.105224609375
27141/28840	I know he is a Gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for	71.31808471679688
27142/28840	The king and the cardinal are the best of friends their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive	494.1053771972656
27143/28840	I am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by	196.33004760742188
27144/28840	Be assured that I am devoted to both these allpowerful masters and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king and also the cardinalone of the most illustrious geniuses that France has ever	135.64443969726562
27145/28840	Now young man regulate your conduct accordingly and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us	393.75054931640625
27146/28840	I will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my	416.93560791015625
27147/28840	I hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend for you are the only young man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to	39.486812591552734
27148/28840	Tréville said to himself If the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failedhe who knows how bitterly I execrate himto tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at	430.38946533203125
27149/28840	Therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as I suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his Eminence in	202.6983642578125
27150/28840	DArtagnan answered with the greatest simplicity I came to Paris with exactly such	119.35128784179688
27151/28840	My father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourselfwhom he considered the first three personages in	345.70947265625
27152/28840	de Tréville to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no	249.6915740966797
27153/28840	I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his	64.37616729736328
27154/28840	But I still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all	117.58560943603516
27155/28840	de Tréville was surprised to the greatest	69.35559844970703
27156/28840	So much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his	1632.6593017578125
27157/28840	The more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive	106.78020477294922
27158/28840	Nevertheless he pressed DArtagnans hand and said to him You are an honest youth but at the present moment I can only do for you that which I just now	48.88933563232422
27159/28840	My hôtel will be always open to	414.0338134765625
27160/28840	Hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you	144.67822265625
27161/28840	That is to say replied DArtagnan that you will wait until I have proved myself worthy of	34.854923248291016
27162/28840	Well be assured added he with the familiarity of a Gascon you shall not wait	71.95057678222656
27163/28840	And he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own	49.912410736083984
27164/28840	I promised you a letter for the director of the	39.849918365478516
27165/28840	de Tréville smiled at this flourish and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of	232.1768341064453
27166/28840	While he was doing this DArtagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the Musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they	109.91240692138672
27167/28840	de Tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to	48.45549392700195
27168/28840	But at the very moment when DArtagnan stretched out his hand to receive it	20.260480880737305
27169/28840	de Tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying Sblood he shall not escape me this time   And who asked	263.6168518066406
27170/28840	The devil take the madman murmured	169.79220581054688
27171/28840	de Trévilles private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a how	1065.3248291015625
27172/28840	Excuse me said DArtagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but I am in a	30.912368774414062
27173/28840	Scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped	130.98995971679688
27174/28840	You are in a hurry said the Musketeer as pale as a	75.45150756835938
27175/28840	Under that pretense you run against me You say Excuse me and you believe that is sufficient Not at all my young	156.09982299804688
27176/28840	Do you fancy because you have heard Monsieur de Tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us Undeceive yourself comrade you are not Monsieur de Tré	79.05741882324219
27177/28840	My faith replied DArtagnan recognizing Athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own	87.25865936279297
27178/28840	I did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally I said Excuse	620.8158569335938
27179/28840	It appears to me that this is quite	38.62769317626953
27180/28840	I repeat to you however and this time on my word of honorI think perhaps too oftenthat I am in haste great	227.01344299316406
27181/28840	Leave your hold then I beg of you and let me go where my business calls	81.35662841796875
27182/28840	Monsieur said Athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a	54.20039367675781
27183/28840	DArtagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at Athoss last remark he stopped	185.45603942871094
27184/28840	_Morbleu_ monsieur said he however far I may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners I warn	71.5781021118164
27185/28840	Ah If I were not in such haste and if I were not running after someone said DArtagn	31.88114356994629
27186/28840	Monsieur Maninahurry you can find me without running_me_ you understand   And where I pray you   Near the CarmesDesch	715.7970581054688
27187/28840	At what hour   About	310.0409240722656
27188/28840	About noon That will do I will be	822.1572875976562
27189/28840	Endeavor not to make me wait for at quarter past twelve I will cut off your ears as you	112.57599639892578
27190/28840	Good cried DArtagnan I will be there ten minutes before	28.355270385742188
27191/28840	And he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him	256.934814453125
27192/28840	But at the street gate Porthos was talking with the soldier on	94.68826293945312
27193/28840	Between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to	433.05560302734375
27194/28840	DArtagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between	38.352935791015625
27195/28840	But DArtagnan had reckoned without the	91.28861999511719
27196/28840	As he was about to pass the wind blew out Porthoss long cloak and DArtagnan rushed straight into the middle of	38.39081954956055
27197/28840	DArtagnan hearing the Musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of	110.63140106201172
27198/28840	He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of Porthosthat is to say exactly upon the bald	403.19476318359375
27199/28840	Alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff	354.6566162109375
27200/28840	Vainglorious as he was Porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least	359.5733337402344
27201/28840	One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the	263.3768615722656
27202/28840	Bless me cried Porthos making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of DArtagnan who was wriggling about his back you must be mad to run against people in this	215.13543701171875
27203/28840	Excuse me said DArtagnan reappearing under the shoulder of the giant but I am in such hasteI was running after someone and   And do you always forget your eyes when you run asked Porth	65.78450012207031
27204/28840	No replied DArtagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes I can see what other people cannot	59.50832748413086
27205/28840	Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger Monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub Musketeers in this	198.80873107910156
27206/28840	Chastised Monsieur said DArtagnan the expression is	87.00123596191406
27207/28840	It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the	133.38682556152344
27208/28840	Ah _pardieu_ I know full well that you dont turn your back to	77.1259536743164
27209/28840	And the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing	472.59912109375
27210/28840	Porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after DArtagn	49.694454193115234
27211/28840	Presently presently cried the latter when you havent your cloak	319.61419677734375
27212/28840	At one oclock then behind the	264.16900634765625
27213/28840	Very well at one oclock then replied DArtagnan turning the angle of the	36.070255279541016
27214/28840	But neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some	279.9294738769531
27215/28840	He began to reflect upon the events that had passed they were numerous and inausp	87.38145446777344
27216/28840	It was scarcely eleven oclock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with	30.344234466552734
27217/28840	de Tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which DArtagnan had left him a little caval	26.07539176940918
27218/28840	Sure of being killed by Athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porth	51.053627014160156
27219/28840	The only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at	234.99073791503906
27220/28840	He had good cause to do so the pain I gave him must have been atro	132.0808563232422
27221/28840	As to Porthos that is certainly droll but I am not the less a giddy	66.09493255615234
27222/28840	Ah cursed Gascon that I am I get from one hobble into	1019.0277709960938
27223/28840	Friend DArtagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance I would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the	140.46939086914062
27224/28840	You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of	303.39801025390625
27225/28840	To be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a	931.4623413085938
27226/28840	Look at Aramis now Aramis is mildness and grace person	545.27099609375
27227/28840	Well did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a coward No certainly not and from this moment I will endeavor to model myself after	356.7737731933594
27228/28840	de Tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see	77.18805694580078
27229/28840	DArtagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious	145.10533142089844
27230/28840	All four besides immediately broke off their	1718.4805908203125
27231/28840	He was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon	159.66671752929688
27232/28840	This appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his	119.74873352050781
27233/28840	Aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gas	59.57570266723633
27234/28840	He perceived his mistake but the friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young Musketeer with affected	322.2327880859375
27235/28840	You make the demand badly replied Aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation I refuse it on account of the	596.5484619140625
27236/28840	The fact is hazarded DArtagnan timidly I did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aram	45.859439849853516
27237/28840	He had his foot upon it that is all and I thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was	112.05206298828125
27238/28840	And you were deceived my dear sir replied Aramis coldly very little sensible to the rep	121.42066955566406
27239/28840	No upon my honor cried his Majestys Guards	2315.754638671875
27240/28840	You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have	77.69117736816406
27241/28840	Now here Montaran we will do better than thatlet each take a	666.484619140625
27242/28840	Perfectly just cried the other two Guardsmen the judgment of King Solomon Aramis you certainly are full of wisdom   The young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other	348.1478576660156
27243/28840	In a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three Guardsmen and the Musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the Guardsmen going one way and Aramis	612.8912963867188
27244/28840	Ah monsieur interrupted Aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man	44.89692306518555
27245/28840	What the devil Paris is not paved with cambric   Monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said DArtagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific	393.2242736816406
27246/28840	Monsieur what I say to you about the matter said Aramis is not for the sake of seeking a	37.8568229675293
27247/28840	Thank God I am not a bravo And being a Musketeer but for a time I only fight when I am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by	134.87576293945312
27248/28840	Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief   Why did you so awkwardly let it fall   I have said monsieur and I repeat that the handkerchief did not fall from my	80.69110870361328
27249/28840	And thereby you have lied twice monsieur for I saw it	171.17457580566406
27250/28840	Ah you take it with that tone do you Master Gascon Well I will teach you how to behave	182.89608764648438
27251/28840	And I will send you back to your Mass book Master Abb	271.3703918457031
27252/28840	Draw if you please and instantly   Not so if you please my good friendnot here at	58.78596115112305
27253/28840	I wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to	119.64057159423828
27254/28840	I agree monsieur but do not be too	133.17759704589844
27255/28840	Take your handkerchief whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of	62.83450698852539
27256/28840	At two oclock I shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of Monsieur de Tré	24.352920532226562
27257/28840	There I will indicate to you the best place and	179.8942108154297
27258/28840	THE KINGS MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINALS GUARDS     DArtagnan was acquainted with nobody in	34563.28515625
27259/28840	He went therefore to his appointment with Athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should	203.174072265625
27260/28840	He reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more	90.650146484375
27261/28840	He hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of Athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him	381.5757141113281
27262/28840	He flattered himself he should be able to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover Porthos with	234.23838806152344
27263/28840	In addition to this DArtagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart Endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and Monsieur de Tré	111.0865478515625
27264/28840	When DArtagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery Athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve oclock was	103.60726165771484
27265/28840	He was then as punctual as the Samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to	465.7040710449219
27266/28840	Athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by	537.6563110351562
27267/28840	de Trévilles surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the	480.2548522949219
27268/28840	Monsieur said Athos I have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which I am astonished as it is not at all their	59.269771575927734
27269/28840	You know no one but Monsieur de Tréville he	24.88514518737793
27270/28840	Well but then continued Athos speaking half to himself if I kill you I shall have the air of a boys	152.39842224121094
27271/28840	Not too much so replied DArtagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very	74.76070404052734
27272/28840	Very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly I can tell	747.0322875976562
27273/28840	But I will take the left handit is my custom in such	74.05974578857422
27274/28840	Do not fancy that I do you a favor I use either hand	1306.6419677734375
27275/28840	And it will be even a disadvantage to you a lefthanded man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for	224.01983642578125
27276/28840	I regret I did not inform you sooner of this	133.1244659423828
27277/28840	You have truly monsieur said DArtagnan bowing again a courtesy for which I assure you I am very	31.848915100097656
27278/28840	You confuse me replied Athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you	86.23072814941406
27279/28840	Ah sblood how you have hurt me My shoulder quite	3792.00146484375
27280/28840	If you would permit me said DArtagnan with tim	42.02220916748047
27281/28840	What monsieur   I have a miraculous balsam for woundsa balsam given to me by my mother and of which I have made a trial upon	181.39378356933594
27282/28840	Well   Well I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you and at the end of three days when you would be curedwell sir it would still do me a great honor to be your	121.6025390625
27283/28840	DArtagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his	109.58594512939453
27284/28840	_Pardieu_ monsieur said Athos thats a proposition that pleases me not that I can accept it but a league off it savors of the	67.99322509765625
27285/28840	Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of Charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his	270.6329040527344
27286/28840	Unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known I say that we were to fight and our combat would be	146.8252410888672
27287/28840	I think these fellows will never	242.923095703125
27288/28840	There is another word which pleases me cried Athos with a gracious nod to DArtagn	41.30217361450195
27289/28840	That did not come from a man without a	70.51886749267578
27290/28840	Monsieur I love men of your kidney and I foresee plainly that if we dont kill each other I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your	188.86097717285156
27291/28840	We will wait for these gentlemen so please you I have plenty of time and it will be more	75.44110870361328
27292/28840	Ah here is one of them I	48.157318115234375
27293/28840	In fact at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos	46.928401947021484
27294/28840	What cried DArtagnan is your first witness Monsieur Porthos   Yes that disturbs you   By no	48.49571228027344
27295/28840	DArtagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos and perceived Aram	33.140602111816406
27296/28840	It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said Ath	53.69400405883789
27297/28840	My faith replied DArtagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon	245.4667510986328
27298/28840	In the meantime Porthos had come up waved his hand to Athos and then turning toward DArtagnan stood quite	47.52799987792969
27299/28840	Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his	368.27789306640625
27300/28840	Ah ah said he what does this mean   This is the gentleman I am going to fight with said Athos pointing to DArtagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same	19.507150650024414
27301/28840	Why it is with him I am also going to fight said Porth	37.2232666015625
27302/28840	But not before one oclock replied DArtagn	21.815317153930664
27303/28840	And I also am to fight with this gentleman said Aramis coming in his turn onto the	72.30713653564453
27304/28840	But not until two oclock said DArtagnan with the same calm	14.380615234375
27305/28840	But what are you going to fight about Athos asked Aram	25.604389190673828
27306/28840	And you Porthos   Faith I am going to fightbecause I am going to fight answered Porthos redd	30.20064926147461
27307/28840	Athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied We had a short discussion upon	403.0980529785156
27308/28840	Oh ours is a theological quarrel replied Aramis making a sign to DArtagnan to keep secret the cause of their	126.23524475097656
27309/28840	Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of DArtagn	33.24571228027344
27310/28840	Augustine upon which we could not agree said the Gas	99.73185729980469
27311/28840	Decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured Ath	159.7517852783203
27312/28840	And now you are assembled gentlemen said DArtagnan permit me to offer you my	47.21150588989258
27313/28840	At this word _apologies_ a cloud passed over the brow of Athos a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos and a negative sign was the reply of Aram	71.86907196044922
27314/28840	You do not understand me gentlemen said DArtagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the	63.06527328491211
27315/28840	And now gentlemen I repeat excuse me but on that account only andon guard   At these words with the most gallant air possible DArtagnan drew his	94.32923126220703
27316/28840	The blood had mounted to the head of DArtagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against Athos Porthos and Aram	28.270645141601562
27317/28840	The sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ard	331.1705017089844
27318/28840	That is true Monsieur replied DArtagnan and whether drawn by myself or another I assure you I shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a	76.50040435791016
27319/28840	I will therefore fight in my doublet like	164.2989044189453
27320/28840	Come come enough of such compliments cried Porth	263.2339782714844
27321/28840	Remember we are waiting for our	322.353759765625
27322/28840	Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted Aram	207.4897918701172
27323/28840	For my part I think what they say is very well said and quite worthy of two	144.99673461914062
27324/28840	When you please monsieur said Athos putting himself on	20.723278045654297
27325/28840	I waited your orders said DArtagnan crossing	99.09683227539062
27326/28840	But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the Guards of his Eminence commanded by	494.734130859375
27327/28840	de Jussac turned the corner of the	917.2251586914062
27328/28840	The cardinals Guards cried Aramis and Porthos at the same	47.977115631103516
27329/28840	Sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords   But it was too	175.3620147705078
27330/28840	The two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their	127.0456314086914
27331/28840	If we were to see you fighting I can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent	62.21043395996094
27332/28840	Leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to	718.3944091796875
27333/28840	Gentlemen said Jussac it is with great regret that I pronounce the thing	954.9332275390625
27334/28840	Sheathe then if you please and follow	291.26885986328125
27335/28840	Monsieur said Aramis parodying Jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves but unfortunately the thing is impossibleMonsieur de Tréville has forbidden	107.51055145263672
27336/28840	Pass on your way then it is the best thing to	42.41946029663086
27337/28840	We will charge upon you then said he if you disob	151.33811950683594
27338/28840	There are five of them said Athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a conquered	129.04476928710938
27339/28840	Athos Porthos and Aramis instantly drew near one another while Jussac drew up his	86.32057189941406
27340/28840	This short interval was sufficient to determine DArtagnan on the part he was to	143.418212890625
27341/28840	It was one of those events which decide the life of a man it was a choice between the king and the cardinalthe choice made it must be persisted	95.11980438232422
27342/28840	To fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king	132.3860321044922
27343/28840	All this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a	253.38226318359375
27344/28840	Turning towards Athos and his friends Gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you	54.85179138183594
27345/28840	You said you were but three but it appears to me we are	165.0855712890625
27346/28840	But you are not one of us said Porth	11.614026069641113
27347/28840	Thats true replied DArtagnan I have not the uniform but I have the	66.6156997680664
27348/28840	My heart is that of a Musketeer I feel it monsieur and that impels me	76.9207992553711
27349/28840	Withdraw young man cried Jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed DArtagnans	339.9286804199219
27350/28840	You may retire we consent to	261.2603454589844
27351/28840	Decidedly you are a brave fellow said Athos pressing the young mans	88.80106353759766
27352/28840	Come come choose your part replied Juss	3749.635986328125
27353/28840	Well said Porthos to Aramis we must do	11.772247314453125
27354/28840	Monsieur is full of generosity said Ath	64.27647399902344
27355/28840	But all three reflected upon the youth of DArtagnan and dreaded his inexper	547.2777099609375
27356/28840	We should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed Athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four	118.0601806640625
27357/28840	Try me gentlemen said he and I swear to you by my honor that I will not go hence if we are	49.70492935180664
27358/28840	What is your name my brave fellow said Ath	28.55535125732422
27359/28840	Well then Athos Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan forward cried Ath	21.458934783935547
27360/28840	Come gentlemen have you decided cried Jussac for the third	372.0509033203125
27361/28840	And what is your choice asked Juss	800.5132446289062
27362/28840	We are about to have the honor of charging you replied Aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the	48.43544387817383
27363/28840	Ah You resist do you cried Juss	5311.1328125
27364/28840	Sblood does that astonish you   And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of	207.72776794433594
27365/28840	Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac a favorite of the card	367.2779541015625
27366/28840	Porthos had Bicarat and Aramis found himself opposed to two	444.0182800292969
27367/28840	As to DArtagnan he sprang toward Jussac	107.92793273925781
27368/28840	This contest at length exhausted Jussacs	5197.703125
27369/28840	Furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make	347.6601257324219
27370/28840	DArtagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his	277.0027160644531
27371/28840	Jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while Jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his	358.8609619140625
27372/28840	DArtagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of	29.659046173095703
27373/28840	Aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warm	58.511756896972656
27374/28840	Nevertheless Aramis was in a good situation and able to defend	66.24275207519531
27375/28840	Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterh	314.4356994628906
27376/28840	Porthos had received a thrust through his arm and Bicarat one through his	437.8117370605469
27377/28840	But neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnest	278.5274353027344
27378/28840	Athos wounded anew by Cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a	781.619384765625
27379/28840	He only changed his sword hand and fought with his left	98.0008544921875
27380/28840	According to the laws of dueling at that period DArtagnan was at liberty to assist whom he	98.14615631103516
27381/28840	While he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from Ath	150.48861694335938
27382/28840	Athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask	312.2442932128906
27383/28840	DArtagnan interpreted it with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of Cahusac crying To me Monsieur Guardsman I will slay you   Cahusac	668.7403564453125
27384/28840	It was time for Athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his	154.4187469482422
27385/28840	Sblood cried he to DArtagnan do not kill him young man I beg of	38.88294982910156
27386/28840	I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and sound	140.77725219726562
27387/28840	Disarm him onlymake sure of his	8243.21875
27388/28840	Thats it Very well done   The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly twenty paces from	205.64207458496094
27389/28840	DArtagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but DArtagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon	99.34981536865234
27390/28840	DArtagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes Cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his	109.50811767578125
27391/28840	At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for	128.31631469726562
27392/28840	There only then remained Porthos and Bic	2585.98193359375
27393/28840	Porthos made a thousand flourishes asking Bicarat what oclock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brothers having just obtained a company in the regiment of Navarre but jest as he might he gained	834.7018432617188
27394/28840	Bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell	220.41751098632812
27395/28840	The watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinal	575.8141479492188
27396/28840	Athos Aramis and DArtagnan surrounded Bicarat and required him to	224.74644470214844
27397/28840	Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh Bicarat wished to hold out but Jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to	559.8704223632812
27398/28840	But there are four against you leave off I command	294.0997314453125
27399/28840	Ah if you command me thats another thing said Bic	609.4981079101562
27400/28840	As you are my commander it is my duty to	54.015132904052734
27401/28840	And springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist	267.7027282714844
27402/28840	Bravery is always respected even in an	1190.670654296875
27403/28840	The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with their swords and returned them to their she	405.62469482421875
27404/28840	Then assisted by Bicarat the only one left standing they bore Jussac Cahusac and one of Aramiss adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the	969.0669555664062
27405/28840	The fourth as we have said was	149.1795196533203
27406/28840	They then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of	351.0109558105469
27407/28840	They walked arm in arm occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every Musketeer they met so that in the end it became a triumphal	343.7294006347656
27408/28840	The heart of DArtagnan swam in delirium he marched between Athos and Porthos pressing them tender	60.99847412109375
27409/28840	If I am not yet a Musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of	42.63689041137695
27410/28840	de Tréville scolded his Musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king	363.03485107421875
27411/28840	de Tréville hastened to report himself at the Lou	76.35568237304688
27412/28840	The king was closeted with the cardinal and	124.80668640136719
27413/28840	de Tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that	55.19102478027344
27414/28840	de Tréville attended the kings gaming	1986.0074462890625
27415/28840	The king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent	86.794677734375
27416/28840	de Tréville at a distance   Come here Monsieur Captain said he come here that I may growl at	97.23954772949219
27417/28840	Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints against your Musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his Eminence is indisposed Ah these Musketeers of yours are very devilsfellows to be	215.74545288085938
27418/28840	No sire replied Tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire Ill be their	314.1879577636719
27419/28840	And that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majestys	53.96338653564453
27420/28840	But what are they to do The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend	145.882568359375
27421/28840	But dont fancy that I am going to take you on your bare	101.30404663085938
27422/28840	I am called Louis the Just Monsieur de Tréville and by and by by and by we will	137.6247100830078
27423/28840	Ah sire it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your	97.0145492553711
27424/28840	Wait then monsieur wait said the king I will not detain you	41.92414855957031
27425/28840	In fact fortune changed and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagneif we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our	324.64227294921875
27426/28840	Ah I had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain	133.55796813964844
27427/28840	de Tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window Well monsieur continued he you say it is his Eminences Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers   Yes sire as they always	75.92613983154297
27428/28840	And how did the thing happen Let us see for you know my dear Captain a judge must hear both	304.1922607421875
27429/28840	Good Lord In the most simple and natural manner	229.8734893798828
27430/28840	The party was to take place at	73.35527038574219
27431/28840	Ah ah You incline me to think so said the	174.51675415039062
27432/28840	There is no doubt they went thither to fight	225.88990783691406
27433/28840	I do not accuse them sire but I leave your Majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carm	168.2293243408203
27434/28840	Yes Tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in France two heads to	173.3506317138672
27435/28840	But all this will come to an end Tréville will come to an	69.22677612304688
27436/28840	You say then that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the Musketeers   I say that it is probable that things have fallen out so but I will not swear to it s	98.09664916992188
27437/28840	You know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes Louis	173.17251586914062
27438/28840	to be named the Just   You are right Tréville but they were not alone your Musket	107.1864242553711
27439/28840	Why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory   Yes sire as complete as that of the Bridge of	255.76841735839844
27440/28840	Four men one of them wounded and a youth say you   One hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to your	198.9020233154297
27441/28840	How does he call himself   DArtagnan sire he is the son of one of my oldest friendsthe son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil	51.0807991027832
27442/28840	And you say this young man behaved himself well Tell me how Trévilleyou know how I delight in accounts of war and	1563.8963623046875
27443/28840	twisted his mustache proudly placing his hand upon his	1914.2391357421875
27444/28840	Sire resumed Tréville as I told you Monsieur dArtagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer he was dressed as a	32.4425163269043
27445/28840	The Guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they	177.999755859375
27446/28840	So you may plainly see Tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked   That is true sire there can be no more doubt on that	95.1791000366211
27447/28840	They called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a Musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your Majesty and that therefore he would remain with Messieurs the Musket	152.14553833007812
27448/28840	Well he did remain with them and your Majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so	670.868408203125
27449/28840	He who wounded Jussac cried the king he a boy Tréville thats impossible   It is as I have the honor to relate it to your	141.0357208251953
27450/28840	Jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom   Well sire for once he found his	227.64498901367188
27451/28840	I will see this young man TrévilleI will see him and if anything can be donewell we will make it our	69.41690826416016
27452/28840	When will your Majesty deign to receive him   Tomorrow at midday Tré	135.77320861816406
27453/28840	Shall I bring him alone   No bring me all four	96.32524108886719
27454/28840	I wish to thank them all at	85.33858489990234
27455/28840	Devoted men are so rare Tréville by the back	327.7206115722656
27456/28840	It is useless to let the cardinal	53.966861724853516
27457/28840	You understand Trévillean edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after	340.4523010253906
27458/28840	But this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a	249.74241638183594
27459/28840	It is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinals Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur dArtagn	86.92634582519531
27460/28840	That is true said the king but never mind Tréville come still by the back	86.08331298828125
27461/28840	Tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of	272.52398681640625
27462/28840	That evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded	173.2261962890625
27463/28840	As they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but DArtagnan with his Gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden	68.40557098388672
27464/28840	By eight oclock in the morning he was at the apartment of Ath	21.33208656311035
27465/28840	DArtagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go	42.16482162475586
27466/28840	As the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the	63.76468276977539
27467/28840	Athos invited DArtagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine oclock in the morning as it then scarcely was till	80.34123229980469
27468/28840	The two Musketeers were already there and were playing	130.60650634765625
27469/28840	DArtagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without	146.58193969726562
27470/28840	Unfortunately for DArtagnan among the spectators was one of his Eminences Guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging	107.73470306396484
27471/28840	He believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor It is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a Musketeer	162.9140167236328
27472/28840	DArtagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent	105.9812240600586
27473/28840	_Pardieu_ resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman I have said what I have	99.23575592041016
27474/28840	And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied DArtagnan in a low voice I beg you to follow	39.96223449707031
27475/28840	And when asked the Guardsman with the same jeering	214.4054718017578
27476/28840	And you know who I am without doubt   I I am completely ignorant nor does it much disquiet	128.8935546875
27477/28840	Youre in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so	147.89956665039062
27478/28840	What is your name   Bernajoux at your	254.09779357910156
27479/28840	Well then Monsieur Bernajoux said DArtagnan tranquilly I will wait for you at the	48.383609771728516
27480/28840	Do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out	135.27891540527344
27481/28840	You must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the	107.13987731933594
27482/28840	Thats true said the Guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young	253.56065368652344
27483/28840	Indeed the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world DArtagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not rep	148.40841674804688
27484/28840	Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game and Athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the Guardsman of his Eminence stopped outside the	60.80022430419922
27485/28840	An instant after the Guardsman descended in his	351.4386901855469
27486/28840	Never mind be content I will do my	165.72828674316406
27487/28840	On guard   But said he whom DArtagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the Abbey	147.89645385742188
27488/28840	What you say is full of sense replied DArtagnan but unfortunately I have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve	84.2835693359375
27489/28840	On guard then monsieur on guard   Bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him	200.02432250976562
27490/28840	In an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to	163.5231170654297
27491/28840	But DArtagnan had on the preceding day served his apprentices	91.4373550415039
27492/28840	Fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a	367.3516845703125
27493/28840	He freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the	429.7109375
27494/28840	DArtagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon DArtagnans	363.09320068359375
27495/28840	As however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of	322.0366516113281
27496/28840	But Athos Porthos and Aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them	110.06932830810547
27497/28840	Thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the Red Duke as Aramis had called him often took part with the kings Musketeers in these quarrel	215.07432556152344
27498/28840	Of three Guardsmen of the company of	425.5964660644531
27499/28840	Dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel of	305.2331848144531
27500/28840	de Tréville crying To the rescue Musketeers To the rescue As usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their	246.33042907714844
27501/28840	The _mêlée_ became general but strength was on the side of the Musket	129.929931640625
27502/28840	de la Trémouilles people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with	548.417236328125
27503/28840	As to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad	31.45001792907715
27504/28840	Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of	290.1416015625
27505/28840	de la Trémouilles domestics in daring to make a _sortie_ upon the kings Musket	942.549560546875
27506/28840	The proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven oclock	140.49009704589844
27507/28840	DArtagnan and his companions remembered their audience and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too	165.22598266601562
27508/28840	Besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of	202.5555419921875
27509/28840	de Tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh	111.87513732910156
27510/28840	Quick to the Louvre said he to the Louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the	41.003517150878906
27511/28840	We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the affair of yesterday and the two will pass off	121.1392593383789
27512/28840	de Tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the Louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the Musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of	61.95140838623047
27513/28840	de Tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become	394.0621337890625
27514/28840	Had his Majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday   No your Excellency replied the valet de chambre the Master of the Hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a	196.0658416748047
27515/28840	At first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after	76.49325561523438
27516/28840	And the king has seen the cardinal asked	101.96260070800781
27517/28840	In all probability he has replied the valet for I saw the horses harnessed to his Eminences carriage this morning and when I asked where he was going they told me To	120.08867645263672
27518/28840	He is beforehand with us said	186.50694274902344
27519/28840	Gentlemen I will see the king this evening but as to you I do not advise you to risk doing	132.6820526123047
27520/28840	This advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute	110.2757339477539
27521/28840	de Tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for	260.2894592285156
27522/28840	de Tréville thought it best to be first in making the	244.7341766357422
27523/28840	He sent one of his servants to	121.36920928955078
27524/28840	de la Trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinals Guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making _sortie_ against the kings Musket	568.739990234375
27525/28840	de la Trémouillealready prejudiced by his esquire whose relative as we already know Bernajoux wasreplied that it was neither for	3390.396728515625
27526/28840	de Tréville nor the Musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to	197.62527465820312
27527/28840	Now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion	689.3617553710938
27528/28840	de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it	284.7345886230469
27529/28840	This was to go himself to	158.78530883789062
27530/28840	He repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be	797.2711181640625
27531/28840	The two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least	456.1494140625
27532/28840	Both were men of courage and honor and as	348.14569091796875
27533/28840	de la Trémouillea Protestant and seeing the king seldomwas of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social	2156.220458984375
27534/28840	This time however his address although polite was cooler than	3355.71337890625
27535/28840	de Tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and I am come to endeavor to clear up this	75.31901550292969
27536/28840	de la Trémouille but I warn you that I am well informed and all the fault is with your Musket	153.20843505859375
27537/28840	You are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said Tréville not to accept the proposal I am about to make to	73.68937683105469
27538/28840	How is Monsieur Bernajoux your esquires relative   Why monsieur very ill indeed In addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad	345.99163818359375
27539/28840	But has the wounded man retained his senses   Perfect	124.49066162109375
27540/28840	Does he talk   With difficulty but he can	220.48751831054688
27541/28840	Well monsieur let us go to	17.740581512451172
27542/28840	Let us adjure him in the name of the God before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the	201.6617889404297
27543/28840	I will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will	45.665035247802734
27544/28840	de la Trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to	590.3087768554688
27545/28840	Both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man	41.26879119873047
27546/28840	The latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost	64.82039642333984
27547/28840	de la Trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to	453.06060791015625
27548/28840	de Tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested	152.52362060546875
27549/28840	de la Trémouille to interrogate him	1187.6875
27550/28840	Placed between life and death as Bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had	267.2313537597656
27551/28840	He wished Bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of	9640.74609375
27552/28840	de la Trémouille returned to his hôtel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at	484.4740905761719
27553/28840	de Tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist	33418.03515625
27554/28840	It may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminences Guardsmen had	564.0820922851562
27555/28840	The king had not yet returned from	255.50062561035156
27556/28840	Our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his Majesty was	106.96202850341797
27557/28840	At his announcement DArtagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his	72.4121322631836
27558/28840	The coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his	312.00616455078125
27559/28840	His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must	111.72831726074219
27560/28840	He was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his	241.51242065429688
27561/28840	At the first glance DArtagnan judged that the mind of the king was storm	56.31602478027344
27562/28840	This disposition visible as it was in his Majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his	992.2776489257812
27563/28840	In royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at	93.84071350097656
27564/28840	The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step	80.518798828125
27565/28840	DArtagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew Athos Porthos and Aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or lookingindeed as if he had never seen them	54.54762649536133
27566/28840	de Tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his Majesty grumbling entered his	103.26741790771484
27567/28840	Matters go but badly said Athos smiling and we shall not be made Chevaliers of the Order this	125.27144622802734
27568/28840	de Tréville and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me	66.33792114257812
27569/28840	The four young men waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour twenty minutes and seeing that	64.90941619873047
27570/28840	de Tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to	112.37401580810547
27571/28840	de Tréville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his Majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his	182.9853057861328
27572/28840	This however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his Majestys	343.3835754394531
27573/28840	Bad monsieur bad replied the king I am	72.01559448242188
27574/28840	This was in fact the worst complaint of Louis	173.4199981689453
27575/28840	who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say Monsieur Soandso let us weary ourselves	234.6399383544922
27576/28840	How Your Majesty is bored Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today   A fine pleasure indeed monsieur Upon my soul everything degenerates and I dont know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no	244.87660217285156
27577/28840	We started a stag of ten	4550.61865234375
27578/28840	We chased him for six hours and when he was near being takenwhen	433.4291076660156

27580/28840	I shall be obliged to give up hunting as I have given up haw	354.6804504394531
27581/28840	Ah I am an unfortunate king Monsieur de Tréville I had but one gerfalcon and he died day before	144.36253356933594
27582/28840	Indeed sire I wholly comprehend your	1908.1905517578125
27583/28840	The misfortune is great but I think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercel	2041.26318359375
27584/28840	And not a man to instruct	78.68378448486328

27587/28840	He knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a prefacea sort of excitation to encourage himselfand that he had now come to his point at	119.92735290527344
27588/28840	And in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty asked	131.05198669433594

27590/28840	Is it thus you perform your charge monsieur continued the king without directly replying to de Trévilles	442.29437255859375
27591/28840	de Tréville calmly on the contrary I come to demand it of	99.30856323242188
27592/28840	Ah This is something new replied the	241.08795166015625
27593/28840	Tell me now can you deny all this   And who told you this fine story sire asked Tréville	86.17350769042969
27594/28840	Who has told me this fine story monsieur Who should it be but he who watches while I sleep who labors while I amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroadin France as in Europe   Your Majesty probably refers to God said	452.488037109375

27601/28840	The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Trémouille from the duke	193.914794921875

27617/28840	Till then God preserve your Majesty   However ill the king might sleep	1837.7403564453125
27618/28840	He had ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the	73.92274475097656
27619/28840	He took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the	278.4974365234375

27626/28840	In fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the kings closet opened and	102.03861999511719
27627/28840	The duke came straight up to him and said Monsieur de Tréville his Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hô	72.59831237792969
27628/28840	I have told him the truth that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that I was ready to offer you my	52.39162063598633
27629/28840	Since I have the good fortune to meet you I beg you to receive them and to hold me always as one of your	40.656517028808594
27630/28840	de Tréville I was so confident of your loyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than	898.6389770507812
27631/28840	I find that I have not been mistaken and I thank you that there is still one man in France of whom may be said without disappointment what I have said of	49.05762481689453
27632/28840	Tell him all this for me for these are things which a king cannot say for	250.4951171875
27633/28840	Thanks sire thanks said the duke but your Majesty may be assured that it is not thoseI do not speak of Monsieur de Trévillewhom your Majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to	103.10652160644531
27634/28840	Ah You have heard what I said So much the better Duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the	59.293460845947266
27635/28840	Where are your Musketeers I told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you why have you not done so   They are below sire and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid them come	173.29327392578125
27636/28840	Yes yes let them come up	113.84420776367188
27637/28840	It is nearly eight oclock and at nine I expect a	96.83708190917969
27638/28840	At the moment he opened the door the three Musketeers and DArtagnan conducted by La Chesnaye appeared at the top of the	104.99192810058594
27639/28840	Come in my braves said the king come in I am going to scold	136.66860961914062
27640/28840	The Musketeers advanced bowing DArtagnan following closely behind	98.81837463378906
27641/28840	One now and then I dont say much about but seven in two days I repeat it is too many it is far too many   Therefore sire your Majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their	292.093505859375
27642/28840	Quite contrite and repentant Hem said the	4858.80712890625
27643/28840	I place no confidence in their hypocritical	1256.62060546875
27644/28840	In particular there is one yonder of a Gascon	284.2448425292969
27645/28840	DArtagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating	163.92189025878906
27646/28840	Why you told me he was a young man This is a boy Tréville a mere boy Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at Jussac   And those two equally fine thrusts at Bernaj	303.9708557128906
27647/28840	Truly   Without reckoning said Athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of Cahusac I should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your	101.22065734863281
27648/28840	Why he is a very devil this Béarnais _Ventresaintgris_ Monsieur de Tréville as the king my father would have	255.72915649414062
27649/28840	But at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords	1776.3992919921875
27650/28840	Which is to say that the Gascons made a king of me myself seeing that I am my fathers son is it not Tréville Well happily I dont say nay to	120.4574966430664
27651/28840	La Chesnaye go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles and if you can find them bring them to	256.3992614746094

27653/28840	This is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the	78.90037536621094
27654/28840	Poor cardinal Seven men in two days and those of his very best But thats quite enough gentlemen please to understand thats	857.92333984375
27655/28840	You have taken your revenge for the Rue Férou and even exceeded it you ought to be	110.88126373291016
27656/28840	If your Majesty is so said Tréville we	629.7308349609375

27658/28840	Here said he is a proof of my	110.2143325805664
27659/28840	At this epoch the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did not	720.5980224609375

27661/28840	DArtagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scrupleon the contrary thanking his Majesty	155.44956970214844
27662/28840	There said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as I told you I expect someone at	124.75504302978516
27663/28840	I may continue to rely upon it may I not   Oh sire cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majestys	104.19340515136719
27664/28840	Well well but keep whole that will be better and you will be more useful to	120.26908111572266
27665/28840	Ah _pardieu_ Tréville I enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will	187.8610382080078
27666/28840	He will be furious but I dont	91.63835906982422
27667/28840	The king waved his hand to Tréville who left him and rejoined the Musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with DArtagn	42.08646774291992
27668/28840	The cardinal as his Majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the kings gaming	782.6468505859375
27669/28840	The repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at	200.23599243164062
27670/28840	The repast had been ordered by Athos and the lackey furnished by Porth	31.155025482177734
27671/28840	He was a Picard whom the glorious Musketeer had picked up on the Bridge Tournelle making rings and plashing in the	793.5775756835938
27672/28840	Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other	386.0032653808594
27673/28840	The noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won Planchetthat was the name of the	131.1982421875
27674/28840	Nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a Crœs	155.4514923095703
27675/28840	He preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of Planchet faded	405.30413818359375
27676/28840	The bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a	46.573429107666016
27677/28840	Planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of DArtagnan and which DArtagnan from that time made shift to do	51.726715087890625
27678/28840	Athos on his part had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion and who was named Grim	155.42466735839844
27679/28840	He was very taciturn this worthy sign	387.91796875
27680/28840	Be it understood we are speaking of Ath	150.51400756835938
27681/28840	During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions Porthos and Aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him	68.3094482421875
27682/28840	His words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more no embellishments no embroidery no arabes	436.7677001953125
27683/28840	His conversation was a matter of fact without a single	323.5015563964844
27684/28840	Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a	76.84905242919922
27685/28840	He certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to	103.48461151123047
27686/28840	His reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of	310.7247009277344
27687/28840	He had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his	176.75559997558594
27688/28840	He never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary	267.2230529785156
27689/28840	Sometimes Grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the	344.3373718261719
27690/28840	Athos then shrugged his shoulders and without putting himself in a passion thrashed Grim	179.98309326171875
27691/28840	On these days he spoke a	185.72906494140625
27692/28840	Porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of Ath	42.56000900268555
27693/28840	He not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or	834.209228515625
27694/28840	He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself	235.4781036376953
27695/28840	He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his	745.388427734375
27696/28840	He had not so noble an air as Athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid	266.74615478515625
27697/28840	But with his simple Musketeers uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot Athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second	120.46715545654297
27698/28840	Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of	95.29631042480469
27699/28840	An old proverb says Like master like	3406.179443359375
27700/28840	Let us pass then from the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos from Grimaud to Mousqu	41.9002571105957
27701/28840	Mousqueton was a Norman whose pacific name of Boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqu	494.1911315917969
27702/28840	He had entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other	187.46336364746094
27703/28840	Porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully	1227.8564453125
27704/28840	As for Aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the charactera character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its developmenthis lackey was called Baz	166.61900329589844
27705/28840	Thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a church	385.7116394042969
27706/28840	He was a Berrichon thirtyfive or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but	1930.0413818359375
27707/28840	For the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable	4615.0654296875
27708/28840	And now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of	295.000732421875
27709/28840	Athos dwelt in the Rue Férou within two steps of the	56.91518020629883
27710/28840	His apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at	679.5880126953125
27711/28840	It had long been an object of ambition for Porth	58.24299621582031
27712/28840	Porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this	62.02693557739258
27713/28840	One day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of Ath	88.30681610107422
27714/28840	In addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry	388.1857604980469
27715/28840	dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the Order of the King was his	454.7427978515625
27716/28840	Besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the	253.87168884277344
27717/28840	Athos always carried the key of this coffer about him but he one day opened it before Porthos and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and paperslove letters and family papers no	131.90582275390625
27718/28840	Porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the Rue du VieuxColomb	260.7212219238281
27719/28840	With regard to DArtagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey Master Planc	49.61966323852539
27720/28840	He addressed himself then to Porthos to gain information respecting Athos and Aramis and to Aramis in order to learn something of Porth	30.661014556884766
27721/28840	Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed	154.18124389648438
27722/28840	It was said Athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant	205.5708770751953
27723/28840	What could this treachery be All the world was ignorant of	168.28997802734375
27724/28840	As to Porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily	74.84766387939453
27725/28840	Vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a	158.7738037109375
27726/28840	The only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of	296.28924560546875
27727/28840	And you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others   _Pardieu_ I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before	122.78236389160156
27728/28840	But be assured my dear Monsieur dArtagnan that if I had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than	51.929351806640625
27729/28840	The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my	50.7711181640625
27730/28840	I was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he	82.08543395996094
27731/28840	As for myself I neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of Athos who has none any more than I	82.55573272705078
27732/28840	But what the devil You are not a priest you are a Musketeer   A Musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a Musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe	88.00637817382812
27733/28840	Athos and Porthos dragged me into this to occupy	86.07017517089844
27734/28840	I had at the moment of being ordained a little difficulty withBut that would not interest you and I am taking up your valuable	315.48773193359375
27735/28840	Not at all it interests me very much cried DArtagnan and at this moment I have absolutely nothing to	59.446983337402344
27736/28840	Yes but I have my breviary to repeat answered Aramis then some verses to compose which Madame dAiguillon begged of	315.5647888183594
27737/28840	Then I must go to the Rue	35.935298919677734
27738/28840	Honoré in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de Chevre	46.33224105834961
27739/28840	So you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry I am very much in a	14.734957695007324
27740/28840	Aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of	26.964059829711914
27741/28840	Notwithstanding all the pains he took DArtagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three newmade	424.325927734375
27742/28840	He formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the	548.3931884765625
27743/28840	In the meanwhile he looked upon Athos as an Achilles Porthos as an Ajax and Aramis as a	213.9605712890625
27744/28840	As to the rest the life of the four young friends was joyous	170.93502807617188
27745/28840	Athos played and that as a rule	1025.02685546875
27746/28840	Nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six oclock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding	140.55308532714844
27747/28840	On the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious if he lost he disappeared completely for several days after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person but with money in his	247.91201782226562
27748/28840	He was the worst Musketeer and the most unconvivial companion	385.0504455566406
27749/28840	He had always something or other to	401.50372314453125
27750/28840	At other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb	248.308837890625
27751/28840	At this Athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and Porthos would drink swearing that Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé	146.0518341064453

27758/28840	DArtagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that DArtagnan carried into	180.41531372070312
27759/28840	After having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his	237.23922729492188

27762/28840	This manner of acting roused much respect for DArtagnans policy among the Musket	155.37799072265625

27774/28840	One fine morning the king commanded	598.1175537109375

27776/28840	DArtagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his	56.9294548034668
27777/28840	Upon this promise DArtagnan withdrew and the next day he began	102.04051971435547
27778/28840	Then it became the turn of Athos Porthos and Aramis to mount guard with DArtagnan when he was on	35.065696716308594
27779/28840	le Chevalier Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted DArtagn	798.2171630859375

27782/28840	At first Athos supported the association for a time with his own	305.4013366699219
27783/28840	Porthos succeeded him and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a	116.1978530883789
27784/28840	At last it became Aramiss turn who performed it with a good grace and who succeededas he said by selling some theological booksin procuring a few pist	891.0753173828125
27785/28840	Then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to	59.74200439453125

27787/28840	At length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which Porthos went to the gaming	147.7707061767578

27791/28840	He was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought	166.3648681640625
27792/28840	As to DArtagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the	155.3768768310547
27793/28840	He fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month and he set his mind actively to	521.0718994140625
27794/28840	He reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less	1143.2083740234375
27795/28840	The only thing that astonished DArtagnan was that his friends had never thought of	49.22010803222656
27796/28840	DArtagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open	26.777000427246094

27800/28840	Planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to DArtagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with	72.12855529785156
27801/28840	DArtagnan dismissed Planchet and requested his visitor to be	58.38884735107422
27802/28840	There was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which DArtagnan bowed as a sign that he	37.33940505981445

27806/28840	I was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because Monsieur Laporte the queens cloak bearer is her godfather and befriends	216.8760223388672
27807/28840	Well resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her work	228.653564453125
27808/28840	And by whom was your wife abducted   I know nothing surely monsieur but I suspect	130.47341918945312
27809/28840	And who is the person whom you suspect   A man who has pursued her a long	62.808982849121094
27810/28840	The devil   But allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that I am convinced that there is less love than politics in all	37.82665252685547
27811/28840	Less love than politics replied DArtagnan with a reflective air and what do you suspect   I do not know whether I ought to tell you what I	43.871219635009766
27812/28840	Monsieur I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely	51.2393798828125
27813/28840	It is you who have come to	19.10686683654785

27815/28840	Act then as you think proper there is still time to	175.41754150390625
27816/28840	No monsieur no you appear to be an honest young man and I will have confidence in	27.288421630859375
27817/28840	I believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than	81.91179656982422
27818/28840	Ah ah Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de BoisTracy said DArtagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court	160.9598388671875
27819/28840	Of Madame dAiguillon   Still	960.4323120117188

27825/28840	Ah ah It begins to develop itself said DArtagn	181.57135009765625

27828/28840	The cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than	517.7593994140625
27829/28840	He cannot pardon her the history of the Sar	1057.9661865234375
27830/28840	You know the history of the Saraband   _Pardieu_ Know it replied DArtagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going	43.863555908203125
27831/28840	So that now it is no longer hatred but	295.3728942871094

27834/28840	That is likely said DArtagnan but the man who has abducted herdo you know him   I have told you that I believe I know	35.49881362915039
27835/28840	His name   I do not know that what I do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil	40.88032150268555
27836/28840	But you have seen him   Yes my wife pointed him out to me one	62.030662536621094
27837/28840	Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him   Oh certainly he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his	356.4420166015625
27838/28840	A scar on his temple cried DArtagnan and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriagewhy thats my man of Me	215.80584716796875
27839/28840	He is your man do you say   Yes yes but that has nothing to do with	24.5201473236084
27840/28840	On the contrary that simplifies the matter	2990.46826171875

27846/28840	Did he give you any details   He knew none	138.5384063720703
27847/28840	And you have learned nothing from any other quarter   Yes I have received   What   I fear I am committing a great impr	51.40257263183594

27850/28840	Besides by the faith of Bonacieux   You call yourself Bonacieux interrupted DArtagn	61.63941955566406
27851/28840	You said then by the word of Bonacie	166.92015075683594
27852/28840	Pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to	81.60237121582031
27853/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan half rising and bowing you are my landlord   Yes monsieur	26.998321533203125

27855/28840	Finish then what you were about to	43.94647979736328
27856/28840	The citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to DArtagn	15.391754150390625
27857/28840	DArtagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read	47.0555419921875
27858/28840	Do not seek your wife read DArtagnan she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for	54.63966369628906
27859/28840	If you make a single step to find her you are	158.19960021972656
27860/28840	Thats pretty positive continued DArtagnan but after all it is but a	188.75601196289062
27861/28840	I am not a fighting man at all monsieur and I am afraid of the Bast	50.4151725769043
27862/28840	I have no greater regard for the Bastille than	280.7672424316406
27863/28840	If it were nothing but a sword thrust why then   I have counted upon you on this occasion monsie	82.07608795166016
27864/28840	And then I have thought that considering three months lodging about which I have said nothing   Yes yes you have already given me that reason and I find it	94.52838134765625
27865/28840	Whom do I see yonder   Where   In the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a	79.13375091552734

27867/28840	Ah this time cried DArtagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me   Drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the	44.5779914855957
27868/28840	On the staircase he met Athos and Porthos who were coming to see	27.82661247253418
27869/28840	They separated and DArtagnan rushed between them like a	77.84767150878906
27870/28840	Pah Where are you going cried the two Musketeers in a	167.4765625
27871/28840	The man of Meung replied DArtagnan and	125.7140884399414
27872/28840	DArtagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important miss	85.41512298583984

27875/28840	Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of DArtagnan and his yellow	68.72142791748047
27876/28840	Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom	163.03268432617188
27877/28840	They understood then from the few words which escaped from DArtagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him DArtagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their	78.83256530761719

27889/28840	How is that cried Porthos and Aramis in a	24.026159286499023
27890/28840	As to Athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating DArtagnan by a	73.26116180419922
27891/28840	Ah ah You have credit with your landlord then asked Porth	159.6352081298828

27893/28840	We must use and not abuse said Aramis sentent	554.6419067382812
27894/28840	I always said that DArtagnan had the longest head of the four said Athos who having uttered his opinion to which DArtagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed	118.51863861083984
27895/28840	But come what is this about asked Porth	59.353031158447266

27898/28840	He then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the Jolly	181.7837677001953
27899/28840	Your affair is not bad said Athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good	113.83031463623047
27900/28840	Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four	223.72744750976562
27901/28840	But observe cried DArtagnan that there is a woman in the affaira woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her	153.14773559570312

27906/28840	Why does she love what we hate most in the world the Spaniards and the English   Spain is her country replied DArtagnan and it is very natural that she should love the Spanish who are the children of the same soil as	82.8542709350586
27907/28840	As to the second reproach I have heard it said that she does not love the English but an English	69.3664779663086

27913/28840	I was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the	99.02356719970703
27914/28840	And did the mercer rejoined Athos tell you DArtagnan that the queen thought that Buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter    Haberdasher     She is afraid	412.3462829589844
27915/28840	Go on while I endeavor to recall	622.4346313476562
27916/28840	And now I am convinced said DArtagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in	74.52369689941406
27917/28840	The Gascon is full of ideas said Porthos with	35.3637809753418
27918/28840	I like to hear him talk said Athos his dialect amuses	225.9131622314453
27919/28840	Listen to Aramis said his three	156.87928771972656
27920/28840	Yesterday I was at the house of a doctor of theology whom I sometimes consult about my	311.19964599609375
27921/28840	He resides in a quiet quarter continued Aramis his tastes and his profession require	1159.3258056640625
27922/28840	Now at the moment when I left his house   Here Aramis	29.111478805541992
27923/28840	This doctor has a niece continued Aram	746.1710815429688
27924/28840	Ah he has a niece interrupted Porth	134.76171875
27925/28840	Ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied Aramis you shall know	58.77519607543945
27926/28840	We believe like Mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said Ath	3445.094970703125
27927/28840	This niece comes sometimes to see her uncle and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that I was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her	126.22651672363281
27928/28840	Ah She has a carriage then this niece of the doctor interrupted Porthos one of whose faults was a great looseness of	447.5453796386719
27929/28840	A nice acquaintance my friend   Porthos replied Aramis I have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the	102.702392578125
27930/28840	Gentlemen gentlemen cried DArtagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is	140.71583557128906
27931/28840	Let us try not to jest if we	147.16232299804688
27932/28840	All at once a tall dark gentlemanjust like yours DArtagn	214.31069946289062
27933/28840	will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise   He took you for Buckingham cried DArtagn	60.55698013305664
27934/28840	He took her for the queen said DArtagn	20.713804244995117
27935/28840	The Gascon is the devil cried Athos nothing escapes	55.7695426940918
27936/28840	The fact is said Porthos Aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a Musketeer   I wore an enormous cloak said Aram	67.43849182128906
27937/28840	In the month of July The devil said Porth	53.65478515625
27938/28840	Is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized   I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person but the face   I had a large hat said Aram	85.11048126220703
27939/28840	Oh good lord cried Porthos what precautions for the study of theology   Gentlemen gentlemen said DArtagnan do not let us lose our time in j	47.69932556152344
27940/28840	Let us separate and let us seek the mercers wifethat is the key of the	273.345947265625
27941/28840	A woman of such inferior condition Can you believe so said Porthos protruding his lips with	506.7560729980469
27942/28840	She is goddaughter to Laporte the confidential valet of the	587.823486328125
27943/28840	Have I not told you so gentlemen Besides it has perhaps been her Majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so	798.4744873046875
27944/28840	High heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is long	4369.685546875
27945/28840	Well said Porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good	130.95779418945312
27946/28840	Thats useless said DArtagnan for I believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another	111.88836669921875
27947/28840	At this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was	154.75332641601562
27948/28840	Save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cried	164.46688842773438
27949/28840	There are four men come to arrest	277.6470947265625
27950/28840	Save me Save me   Porthos and Aramis	30.286409378051758
27951/28840	A moment cried DArtagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their halfdrawn	113.96913146972656
27952/28840	It is not courage that is needed it is prud	238.9100341796875
27953/28840	And yet cried Porthos we will not leave   You will leave DArtagnan to act as he thinks proper said Ath	30.077857971191406
27954/28840	He has I repeat the longest head of the four and for my part I declare that I will obey	206.8993682861328
27955/28840	At this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four Musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going	201.6365203857422
27956/28840	Come in gentlemen come in called DArtagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and	45.82234573364258
27957/28840	Then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the	166.7613525390625
27958/28840	On the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were	110.78057861328125
27959/28840	Silence   But you promised me whispered the poor mer	475.9256896972656
27960/28840	We can only save you by being free ourselves replied DArtagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with	77.02595520019531
27961/28840	It seems nevertheless   Come gentlemen come said DArtagnan aloud I have no motive for defending Monsie	42.55421447753906
27962/28840	I saw him today for the first time and he can tell you on what occasion he came to demand the rent of my	74.58722686767578
27963/28840	And DArtagnan pushed the halfstupefied mercer among the Guards saying to him You are a shabby old fellow my	581.2291870117188
27964/28840	You come to demand money of meof a Musketeer To prison with him Gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay	196.7067413330078
27965/28840	The officers were full of thanks and took away their	217.9365234375
27966/28840	As they were going down DArtagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their	36.41496276855469
27967/28840	May I not drink to your health and you to mine said DArtagnan filling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of	164.33871459960938
27968/28840	That will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and I accept	332.98687744140625
27969/28840	Then to yours monsieurwhat is your name   Boisren	92.72515106201172
27970/28840	To yours my gentlemen What is your name in your turn if you please   DArtagn	40.66484451293945
27971/28840	And above all others cried DArtagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the	36.04974365234375
27972/28840	The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of DArtagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was	95.93538665771484
27973/28840	What diabolical villainy you have performed here said Porthos when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves	60.5003547668457
27974/28840	DArtagnan you are a great man and when you occupy Monsieur de Trévilles place I will come and ask your influence to secure me an ab	62.84300994873047
27975/28840	Well I am in a maze said Porthos do _you_ approve of what DArtagnan has done   _Parbleu_ Indeed I do said Athos I not only approve of what he has done but I congratulate him upon	49.384281158447266
27976/28840	And now gentlemen said DArtagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos All for one one for allthat is our motto is it not   And yet said Porth	61.67346954345703
27977/28840	Hold out your hand and swear cried Athos and Aramis at	59.496952056884766
27978/28840	Overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless Porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by DArtagnan   All for one one for	152.50433349609375
27979/28840	Thats well Now let us everyone retire to his own home said DArtagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention For from this moment we are at feud with the	142.33688354492188
27980/28840	As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de Jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mouset	112.78275299072266
27981/28840	When in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held	482.0788879394531
27982/28840	Four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first	38.03713607788086
27983/28840	The door is opened to all who	545.6812133789062
27984/28840	It is closed after them and they are arrested so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the _habitués_ of the	82.6866455078125
27985/28840	Bonacieux then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinals	291.8451232910156
27986/28840	It must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which DArtagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this	214.7609405517578
27987/28840	Besides nobody came thither but the three Musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered	325.49993896484375
27988/28840	Athos had even gone so far as to question	70.1404800415039
27989/28840	de Trévillea thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer had very much astonished his	330.7772216796875
27990/28840	de Tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queens eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tear	106.61831665039062
27991/28840	But this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept	260.9227294921875
27992/28840	de Tréville requested Athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his	134.72921752929688
27993/28840	As to DArtagnan he did not budge from his	195.32948303222656
27994/28840	He converted his chamber into an observ	1864.9395751953125
27995/28840	From his windows he saw all the visitors who were	189.75933837890625
27996/28840	Then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the	230.02633666992188
27997/28840	Now what is it they want to know Why they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the	42.785282135009766
27998/28840	DArtagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in	131.23890686035156
27999/28840	In the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise DArtagnans	366.1041564941406
28000/28840	On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux as Athos had just left DArtagnan to report at	42.080631256103516
28001/28840	de Trévilles as nine oclock had just struck and as Planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street	111.04041290283203
28002/28840	The door was instantly opened and shut someone was taken in the mouset	174.5930633544922
28003/28840	DArtagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and	88.242919921875
28004/28840	Cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to st	111.56099700927734
28005/28840	It seems like a woman They search her she resists they use forcethe scoundrels   In spite of his prudence DArtagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on	219.6990509033203
28006/28840	But I tell you that I am the mistress of the house gentlemen I tell you I am Madame Bonacieux I tell you I belong to the queen cried the unfortunate	54.75102996826172
28007/28840	Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for   The voice became more and more indistinct a tumultuous movement shook the	204.04408264160156
28008/28840	The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four	346.8826599121094
28009/28840	Pardon gentlemenpar murmured the voice which could now only be heard in inarticulate	153.4761199951172
28010/28840	They are binding her they are going to drag her away cried DArtagnan to himself springing up from the	128.38156127929688
28011/28840	My sword Good it is by my side Planchet   Monsie	43.61335754394531
28012/28840	Run and seek Athos Porthos and Aram	22.018436431884766
28013/28840	One of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all	141.96292114257812
28014/28840	Tell them to take arms to come here and to run Ah I remember Athos is at Monsieur de Trév	134.8588409423828
28015/28840	But where are you going monsieur where are you going   I am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried DArtagn	20.2188663482666
28016/28840	You put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as I told	182.35189819335938
28017/28840	Oh monsieur Monsieur You will kill yourself cried Planc	26.80949592590332
28018/28840	Hold your tongue stupid fellow said DArtagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest	268.9339294433594
28019/28840	Bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after	270.3599853515625
28020/28840	Then those who dwelt in Bonacieuxs unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of	612.84423828125
28021/28840	DArtagnan was conquerorwithout much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for forms	260.4543151855469
28022/28840	It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery but two or three scratches made by the Gascons blade terrified	321.269775390625
28023/28840	Ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and DArtagnan remained master of the field of	56.39666748046875
28024/28840	The neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was	228.0204315185547
28025/28840	Besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the	155.01040649414062
28026/28840	Bonacieux DArtagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left halffainting upon an arm	69.03449249267578
28027/28840	DArtagnan examined her with a rapid	29.867969512939453
28028/28840	She was a charming woman of twentyfive or twentysix years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and op	126.0208969116211
28029/28840	There however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of	404.99481201171875
28030/28840	The hands were white but without delicacy the feet did not bespeak the woman of	1814.828857421875
28031/28840	Happily DArtagnan was not yet acquainted with such nic	97.68932342529297
28032/28840	From that time DArtagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of M	83.8224105834961
28033/28840	Bonacieux the one he had just picked	126.35833740234375

28035/28840	She extended her hands to him with a	41.350284576416016
28036/28840	Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the	107.7230453491211
28037/28840	Ah monsieur said she you have saved me permit me to thank	21.126760482788086
28038/28840	Madame said DArtagnan I have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place you owe me no	37.83966064453125
28039/28840	Oh yes monsieur oh yes and I hope to prove to you that you have not served an ing	57.75985336303711
28040/28840	My husband in the Bastille cried M	872.6569213867188
28041/28840	Oh my God What has he done Poor dear man he is innocence itself   And something like a faint smile lighted the stillterrified features of the young	354.74505615234375
28042/28840	What has he done madame said DArtagn	16.883955001831055
28043/28840	I believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your	45.27561950683594
28044/28840	But monsieur you know then   I know that you have been abducted mad	34.63285827636719
28045/28840	And by whom Do you know him Oh if you know him tell me   By a man of from forty to fortyfive years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left	57.65724182128906
28046/28840	That is he that is he but his name   Ah his name I do not know	35.2776985168457
28047/28840	And did my husband know I had been carried off   He was informed of it by a letter written to him by the abductor	74.08248901367188
28048/28840	Bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event   He attributed it I believe to a political	163.73167419433594
28049/28840	I doubted from the first and now I think entirely as he	269.1353454589844
28050/28840	Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant   So far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your	58.75631332397461
28051/28840	A second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young	288.6335144042969
28052/28840	But continued DArtagnan how did you escape   I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the	56.318359375
28053/28840	Then as I believed my husband would be at home I hastened	101.47175598144531
28054/28840	To place yourself under his protection   Oh no poor dear man I knew very well that he was incapable of defending me but as he could serve us in other ways I wished to inform	95.64798736572266
28055/28840	Of what   Oh that is not my secret I must not therefore tell	41.14213943481445

28058/28840	I have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home   Yes yes You are right cried the affrighted M	62.761470794677734
28059/28840	Bonacieux let us fly Let us save	147.7047576904297
28060/28840	At these words she passed her arm under that of DArtagnan and urged him forward	101.1556167602539
28061/28840	But whither shall we flywhither escape   Let us first withdraw from this house afterward we shall	222.89389038085938
28062/28840	The young woman and the young man without taking the trouble to shut the door after them descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly turned into the Rue des FossésMonsieurlePrince and did not stop till they came to the Place	149.2622528076172
28063/28840	And now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked DArtagn	17.590394973754883
28064/28840	I am at quite a loss how to answer you I admit said M	438.57354736328125
28065/28840	My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte through my husband in order that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the Louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself	53.619834899902344
28066/28840	But I said DArtagnan can go and inform Monsieur Laport	18.610088348388672
28067/28840	No doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that Monsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against	110.54254913330078
28068/28840	Ah bah said DArtagnan you have at some wicket of the Louvre a _concierge_ who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would   M	60.10498046875
28069/28840	Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young	39.48227310180664
28070/28840	And if I give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it   By my honor by the faith of a gentleman said DArtagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake	58.4853401184082
28071/28840	You appear to be a brave young man besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devoted	45.19147872924805
28072/28840	I will do without a promise and voluntarily all that I can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the	59.07624053955078
28073/28840	Dispose of me then as a	218.61526489257812
28074/28840	But Iwhere shall I go meanwhile   Is there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch you   No I can trust	94.3095703125
28075/28840	Stop said DArtagnan we are near Athoss	23.611522674560547
28076/28840	Who is this Athos   One of my	24.39107894897461
28077/28840	But if he should be at home and see me   He is not at home and I will carry away the key after having placed you in his	39.04389190673828
28078/28840	But if he should return   Oh he wont return and if he should he will be told that I have brought a woman with me and that woman is in his	68.67831420898438
28079/28840	But that will compromise me sadly you	821.4742431640625
28080/28840	Besides we are in a situation to overlook	773.487060546875
28081/28840	Come then let us go to your friends	52.88018798828125
28082/28840	Where does he live   Rue Férou two steps from	134.2253875732422
28083/28840	Let us go   Both resumed their	244.24790954589844
28084/28840	As DArtagnan had foreseen Athos was not	21.444751739501953
28085/28840	He took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced M	337.3426818847656

28088/28840	Now in my turn let me give you my	60.005550384521484
28089/28840	Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre on the side of the Rue de lEchelle and ask for Germ	90.89929962158203
28090/28840	Well and then   He will ask you what you want and you will answer by these two words Tours and Bruxell	164.45254516601562
28091/28840	He will at once put himself at your	136.93600463867188
28092/28840	And what shall I command him   To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte the queens _valet de chambre	27.037059783935547
28093/28840	And when he shall have informed him and Monsieur Laporte is come   You will send him to	30.99732208251953
28094/28840	That is well but where and how shall I see you again   Do you wish to see me again  	24.386520385742188
28095/28840	Well let that care be mine and be at	553.0425415039062
28096/28840	Bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double	119.343994140625
28097/28840	In two bounds he was at the Louvre as he entered the wicket of LEchelle ten oclock	232.56918334960938
28098/28840	All the events we have described had taken place within a half	94.51359558105469
28099/28840	In a few minutes Laporte was at the lodge in two words DArtagnan informed him where M	87.91251373291016
28100/28840	Laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a	544.0277709960938
28101/28840	Hardly however had he taken ten steps before he	186.55300903320312
28102/28840	Young man said he to DArtagnan a	86.77092742919922
28103/28840	What   You may get into trouble by what has taken	55.9312744140625
28104/28840	Have you any friend whose clock is too slow   Well   Go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past	120.0391616821289
28105/28840	In a court of justice that is called an al	790.3853759765625
28106/28840	He took to his heels and was soon at	167.01283264160156
28107/28840	de Trévilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to	133.04925537109375
28108/28840	As DArtagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform	310.5909423828125
28109/28840	de Tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private	1131.73974609375
28110/28840	de Tréville was asking DArtagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an	92.02861022949219
28111/28840	Pardon me monsieur said DArtagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back	22.999216079711914
28112/28840	de Trévilles clock threequarters of an hour but I thought as it was yet only twentyfive minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon	124.859130859375
28113/28840	de Tréville looking at the clock why thats impossible   Look rather monsieur said DArtagnan the clock shows	90.05018615722656
28114/28840	But what can I do for you   Then DArtagnan told	23.666580200195312
28115/28840	de Tréville a long history about the	361.24517822265625
28116/28840	He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which	115.34220123291016
28117/28840	de Tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the	118.96843719482422
28118/28840	As ten oclock was striking DArtagnan left	108.40538787841797
28119/28840	de Tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs DArtagnan remembered he had forgotten his	80.88201904296875
28120/28840	IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS     His visit to	198036.40625
28121/28840	de Tréville being paid the pensive DArtagnan took the longest way homew	890.6759643554688
28122/28840	On what was DArtagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling   He was thinking of M	255.23052978515625
28123/28840	For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of	415.73077392578125
28124/28840	Pretty mysterious initiated in almost all the secrets of the court which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved and this is an irresistible charm to novices in	283.12469482421875
28125/28840	Moreover DArtagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender	165.07101440429688
28126/28840	DArtagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a	172.3419952392578
28127/28840	We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without	474.048095703125

28131/28840	DArtagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at Paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in FlandersSpain yonder woman	185.531494140625
28132/28840	In each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be	232.93211364746094
28133/28840	But we must say at the present moment DArtagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and dis	107.79447174072266
28134/28840	The mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as	276.2781066894531
28135/28840	Bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of	338.3388977050781
28136/28840	We say _almost_ for the idea that a young handsome kind and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love but on the contrary strengthens	173.53439331054688
28137/28840	There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to	557.7339477539062
28138/28840	In the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a womans happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of noth	365.2415771484375
28139/28840	At least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to	288.9170227050781
28140/28840	Then DArtagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted	77.63192749023438
28141/28840	In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercers wife he did not forget his	274.2410583496094
28142/28840	Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain	506.3027038574219
28143/28840	Denis or in the fair of	82.38765716552734
28144/28840	Germain in company with Athos Porthos and Aramis to whom DArtagnan had often remarked	12.804401397705078
28145/28840	Then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a	158.4435272216797
28146/28840	Besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties DArtagnan would become the preserver of his	175.40809631347656
28147/28840	Love is the most selfish of all the	107.29084777832031
28148/28840	If DArtagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he	60.77083206176758
28149/28840	But for the moment let us do as did the amorous Gascon we will see after the worthy mercer	482.4884948730469
28150/28840	DArtagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the Rue CherishMidi or ChaseMidi as it was then	1969.4625244140625
28151/28840	This mystery required an explanation at least so DArtagnan declared to	101.41913604736328
28152/28840	He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little M	739.7164916992188

28156/28840	Paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a	238.15821838378906
28157/28840	Eleven oclock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg	121.3709487915039
28158/28840	From a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the	828.1864013671875
28159/28840	Arrived at the end of the lane DArtagnan turned to the	32.10667037963867
28160/28840	The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandon	127.01207733154297
28161/28840	This something was enveloped in a cloak and DArtagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a	60.61308288574219
28162/28840	Further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned	185.35614013671875
28163/28840	Shall I go and offer her my services thought	252.82275390625
28164/28840	By her step she must be young perhaps she is	221.12716674804688
28165/28840	Oh yes But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her	566.0523071289062
28166/28840	If I should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an	68.57720184326172
28167/28840	Meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and	715.816162109375
28168/28840	There were but three hôtels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied the other belonging to Aramis	185.658935546875
28169/28840	_Pardieu_ said DArtagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted _pardieu_ it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friends	155.84701538085938
28170/28840	But on my soul it looks	265.1135559082031
28171/28840	Ah my dear Aramis this time I shall find you	20.70882225036621
28172/28840	And DArtagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a	62.41238784790039
28173/28840	The young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet	202.29611206054688
28174/28840	DArtagnan believed this cough to be a	208.86231994628906
28175/28840	This is all very fine dear Aramis murmured DArtagn	17.058513641357422
28176/28840	Ah Monsieur Hypocrite I understand how you study	2946.205078125
28177/28840	The three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside	197.1797637939453
28178/28840	Ah ah said the listener not through doors but through windows Ah this visit was	1996.657470703125
28179/28840	We shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escal	920.763671875
28180/28840	Very pretty   But to the great astonishment of DArtagnan the shutter remained	87.64576721191406
28181/28840	Still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in	145.94859313964844
28182/28840	DArtagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his	65.8028793334961
28183/28840	He was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard	624.492431640625
28184/28840	The young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little	254.80662536621094
28185/28840	It may be judged whether DArtagnan looked or listened with av	221.05430603027344
28186/28840	Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the	47.46196365356445
28187/28840	Besides the eyes of the Gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the	137.18389892578125
28188/28840	DArtagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handker	54.55380630493164
28189/28840	She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded	1358.4373779296875
28190/28840	This immediately recalled to DArtagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of M	71.87151336669922
28191/28840	Bonacieux which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aram	40.771934509277344
28192/28840	What the devil could that handkerchief signify   Placed where he was DArtagnan could not perceive the face of Aram	71.81063079833984
28193/28840	We say Aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the	119.56665802001953
28194/28840	At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to	76.5047836303711
28195/28840	Then some words were spoken by the two	150.60418701171875
28196/28840	The woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of DArtagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late DArtagnan had already recognized M	75.94971466064453
28197/28840	Bonacieux The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of DArtagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that M	116.60875701904297
28198/28840	But was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards This was a question the young man asked himself whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted	225.3299560546875
28199/28840	There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither M	891.8353881835938
28200/28840	Bonacieux was going that was to follow	204.58615112304688
28201/28840	This method was so simple that DArtagnan employed it quite naturally and	146.4862823486328
28202/28840	But at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her M	105.3227767944336
28203/28840	Bonacieux uttered a little cry and	199.76898193359375
28204/28840	It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her	271.4124450683594
28205/28840	He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the	71.97621154785156

28277/28840	Ah I wish I had never seen you cried DArtagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over	227.2982177734375
28278/28840	Bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of DArtagnan who had not relinquished hers well I will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost	74.97994232177734
28279/28840	Who knows when I shall be at liberty that I may not satisfy your curiosity   And will you make the same promise to my love cried DArtagnan beside himself with	52.8210563659668

28321/28840	But you will remain you are not afraid said DArtagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lac	57.699100494384766
28322/28840	Be easy monsieur said Planchet you do not know me	19.599040985107422

28325/28840	It appears that the method I have adopted with this boy is decidedly the	290.06732177734375
28326/28840	I shall use it again upon	833.5527954101562
28327/28840	And with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day DArtagnan directed his course toward	93.82303619384766

28330/28840	de Tréville it was important that he should be informed of what was	32.78774642944336
28331/28840	DArtagnan resolved to try and enter the Lou	23.242849349975586
28332/28840	His costume of Guardsman in the company of	725.7571411132812
28333/28840	He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the New	70.44778442382812
28334/28840	He had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his	152.80715942382812
28335/28840	As he gained the top of the Rue Guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck	111.40513610839844
28336/28840	Of the two persons who composed this group one was a man and the other a	74.33502960205078
28337/28840	The woman had the outline of M	509.8903503417969
28338/28840	Bonacieux the man resembled Aramis so much as to be mistaken for	133.8390350341797
28339/28840	Besides the woman wore that black mantle which DArtagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a Musket	88.6187973022461
28340/28840	The womans hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his	103.25786590576172
28341/28840	Both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being	503.1031188964844
28342/28840	That was DArtagnans road as he was going to the Lou	25.822696685791016
28343/28840	He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really M	177.7921905517578
28344/28840	Bonacieux and that the man was Aram	51.180274963378906
28345/28840	He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his	537.4248657226562
28346/28840	He felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a	237.56149291992188
28347/28840	Bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know Aramis and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of Aram	49.62172317504883
28348/28840	DArtagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercers pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him	128.374267578125
28349/28840	He considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed	8807.9189453125
28350/28840	Blood and anger mounted to his face he was resolved to unravel the	252.01522827148438

28352/28840	He passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the	283.9074401855469
28353/28840	DArtagnan stopped before them and they stopped before	23.08843994140625
28354/28840	What do you want monsieur demanded the Musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to DArtagnan that he was deceived in one of his conject	42.93028259277344
28355/28840	No monsieur it is not Aramis and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon	66.70199584960938

28364/28840	The Musketeer advanced two steps and pushed DArtagnan aside with his	37.45905685424805
28365/28840	DArtagnan made a spring backward and drew his	30.992290496826172

28372/28840	You know what it is to love my	154.80801391601562
28373/28840	Pardon me and then tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace   You are a brave young man said Buckingham holding out his hand to DArtagnan who pressed it	46.90268325805664
28374/28840	You offer me your services with the same frankness I accept	105.61174774169922

28376/28840	Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles	240.9560089111328
28377/28840	Fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any	146.073974609375
28378/28840	As for DArtagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the PommedePin where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting	135.6423797607422
28379/28840	Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their	112.7791976928711
28380/28840	Meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Lou	74.77165222167969

28382/28840	Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without	45.306026458740234
28383/28840	Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of	65.50181579589844

28386/28840	Bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the Louvre that was	96.41535949707031

28391/28840	She then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a	109.37847900390625
28392/28840	Nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the Duke of Buckingham did not experience an instant of	100.16287994384766
28393/28840	One of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of	368.63580322265625
28394/28840	Brave rash and enterprising this was not the first time he had risked his life in such	132.50254821777344

28398/28840	For two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense but once free and placed in communication with Laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days	274.3040771484375
28399/28840	Buckingham left alone walked toward a	5569.98046875
28400/28840	At thirtyfive which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or	232.79507446289062
28401/28840	It was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud Anne of Austria and in making himself loved by dazzling	187.77999877929688
28402/28840	At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman	39.19130325317383
28403/28840	Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a	348.3331604003906
28404/28840	It was the queen   Anne of Austria was then twentysix or twentyseven years of age that is to say she was in the full splendor of her	30.58639144897461
28405/28840	Her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and	139.50730895996094
28406/28840	Her mouth was small and rosy and although her underlip like that of all princes of the House of Austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its	943.7921142578125

28413/28840	Besides I have lost nothing by this journey because I see	71.25829315185547
28414/28840	Yes replied Anne but you know why and how I see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my	131.0894317626953
28415/28840	I see you to tell you that everything separates usthe depths of the sea the enmity of kingdoms the sanctity of	316.3587646484375

28420/28840	My Lord cried the queen you forget that I have never said that I love	65.70026397705078

28422/28840	Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet Mark I see you	576.0409545898438

28427/28840	Duke said the queen blushing never speak of that	108.07707977294922
28428/28840	Then you were about to tell me allthe isolation of your life the griefs of your	61.7720947265625
28429/28840	You leaned upon my armupon this madame I felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me I trembled from head to	336.1616516113281
28430/28840	Oh Queen Queen You do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like	440.8020324707031

28432/28840	For that night madame that night you loved me I will swear	193.31729125976562
28433/28840	At the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which I had to reply I called for	194.02236938476562
28434/28840	And any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal but my love came out from it more ardent and more	882.0039672851562
28435/28840	You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris you believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to	100.41288757324219

28440/28840	The king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clam	354.59405517578125

28445/28840	I have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to Paris I know that	106.18998718261719

28448/28840	All these proofs of love which you would give me are almost	164.31576538085938

28457/28840	And the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and	85.71389770507812
28458/28840	Oh my God cried Anne of Austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to	67.1761474609375
28459/28840	I do not tell you this madame to terrify you no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me I take no heed of such	82.50304412841797

28476/28840	Anne of Austria reentered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding a rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with	123.43531799316406
28477/28840	Here my Lord here said she keep this in memory of	1309.41748046875
28478/28840	Buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his	241.57229614257812

28480/28840	Your hand madame your hand and I depart   Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon Estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail	170.6943359375
28481/28840	Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said Within six months if I am not dead I shall have seen you again madameeven if I have to overturn the	343.0999450683594
28482/28840	And faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the	58.526180267333984
28483/28840	Bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the Lou	48.807159423828125

28487/28840	The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their musk	189.18617248535156
28488/28840	Thence introduced into a halfsubterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest	809.7865600585938
28489/28840	The officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very	135.27638244628906
28490/28840	At the end of half an hour or thereabouts a clerk came to put an end to his tortures but not to his anxiety by giving the order to conduct	103.24092864990234
28491/28840	Ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells but they did not do so with	522.1749877929688
28492/28840	The commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the	41.390960693359375
28493/28840	The two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear	72.26219177246094
28494/28840	The commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do	56.195072174072266
28495/28840	This commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the	945.79736328125
28496/28840	His head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his	231.3907928466797

28498/28840	The accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux that he was fiftyone years old a retired mercer and lived Rue des Fossoyeurs	963.9821166992188
28499/28840	The commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public	281.8137512207031
28500/28840	He complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to comedeeds and power which none could thwart with	1835.3199462890625
28501/28840	After this second part of his discourse fixing his hawks eye upon poor Bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his	603.9946899414062
28502/28840	The reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when	2389.6689453125
28503/28840	Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady of the Linen to her	1075.267578125
28504/28840	Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme coward	773.52392578125
28505/28840	The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumer	124.19515228271484
28506/28840	Bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to	183.48117065429688
28507/28840	But Monsieur Commissary said he calmly believe that I know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be	124.30890655517578
28508/28840	Indeed asked the commissary with an air of	33.11199188232422

28510/28840	Of high treason cried Bonacieux terrified of high treason How is it possible for a poor mercer who detests Huguenots and who abhors Spaniards to be accused of high treason Consider monsieur the thing is absolutely	733.5208740234375
28511/28840	What you _had_ one What have you done with her then if you have her no longer   They have abducted her monsie	98.73944091796875
28512/28840	They have abducted her Ah   Bonacieux inferred from this Ah that the affair grew more and more	1607.1739501953125
28513/28840	They have abducted her added the commissary and do you know the man who has committed this deed   I think I know	90.33747863769531
28514/28840	Who is he   Remember that I affirm nothing Monsieur the Commissary and that I only	100.1567611694336
28515/28840	Whom do you suspect Come answer	6128.82568359375
28516/28840	Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity	244.18165588378906
28517/28840	Had he better deny everything or tell everything By denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow by confessing all he might prove his good	429.1730041503906
28518/28840	I suspect said he a tall dark man of lofty carriage who has the air of a great	244.0480194091797
28519/28840	He has followed us several times as I think when I have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her	62.663265228271484
28520/28840	The commissary now appeared to experience a little uneas	113.7124252319336
28521/28840	Oh as to his name I know nothing about it but if I were ever to meet him I should recognize him in an instant I will answer for it were he among a thousand	43.14900588989258
28522/28840	The face of the commissary grew still	139.236572265625
28523/28840	You should recognize him among a thousand say you continued	520.074951171875
28524/28840	That is to say cried Bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say   You have answered that you should recognize him said the commiss	67.0273666381836
28525/28840	That is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your	208.604736328125
28526/28840	But I have not told you that I know him cried Bonacieux in	51.00588607788086
28527/28840	I told you on the contrary   Take away the prisoner said the commissary to the two	26.5491943359375
28528/28840	Where must we place him demanded the	509.3363037109375
28529/28840	Which   Good Lord In the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with	194.80868530273438
28530/28840	Alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful	122.91205596923828
28531/28840	They believe me her accomplice and will punish me with	197.9755859375

28533/28840	Bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so	70.7919692993164
28534/28840	He sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal t	184.42576599121094
28535/28840	All at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified	354.8369445800781
28536/28840	He believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them	81.06805419921875
28537/28840	Your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and I advise you to tell the whole truth for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the	152.6269989013672
28538/28840	Why I am ready to tell everything cried Bonacieux at least all that I	104.16792297363281
28539/28840	Interrogate me I entreat you   Where is your wife in the first place   Why did not I tell you she had been stolen from me   Yes but yesterday at five oclock in the afternoon thanks to you she	43.58559036254883
28540/28840	Oh unfortunate creature Monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault I	154.59629821777344
28541/28840	What was the aim of that visit   To beg him to assist me in finding my	131.85015869140625
28542/28840	I believed I had a right to endeavor to find	58.94868469238281
28543/28840	I was deceived as it appears and I ask your	85.09209442138672
28544/28840	And what did Monsieur dArtagnan reply   Monsieur dArtagnan promised me his assistance but I soon found out that he was betraying	28.23872184753418
28545/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond	182.5919647216797
28546/28840	dArtagnan has abducted my wife Come now what are you telling me   Fortunately Monsieur dArtagnan is in our hands and you shall be confronted with	62.7596435546875
28547/28840	By my faith I ask no better cried Bonacieux I shall not be sorry to see the face of an	81.23615264892578

28549/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan said the commissary addressing Athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and Monsie	27.119935989379883
28550/28840	But cried Bonacieux this is not Monsieur dArtagnan whom you show	35.19837951660156
28551/28840	What Not Monsieur dArtagnan exclaimed the commiss	27.642436981201172
28552/28840	Not the least in the world replied Bonacie	194.9282684326172
28553/28840	What is this gentlemans name asked the commiss	36.89500427246094
28554/28840	I cannot tell you I dont know	16.960874557495117
28555/28840	How You dont know him  	34.5337028503418
28556/28840	Did you never see him   Yes I have seen him but I dont know what he calls	16.267112731933594
28557/28840	But that is not a mans name that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his	71.8751449584961
28558/28840	That is my name said Athos	89.20853424072266
28559/28840	But you said that your name was DArtagn	25.382295608520508
28560/28840	Somebody said to me You are Monsieur dArtagnan I answered You think so My guards exclaimed that they were sure of	124.4410400390625
28561/28840	I did not wish to contradict them besides I might be	60.38469696044922
28562/28840	Monsieur you insult the majesty of	170.48080444335938
28563/28840	You see monsieur that you say it	73.01992797851562
28564/28840	But I tell you Monsieur Commissary cried Bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the	50.876766204833984
28565/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rentand even better on that account ought I to know	155.03074645996094
28566/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at	37.900390625
28567/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is in Monsieur Dessessarts Guards and this gentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Trévilles Musket	109.47000122070312
28568/28840	Look at his uniform Monsieur Commissary look at his uniform   Thats true murmured the commissary _pardieu_ thats	48.32594299316406
28569/28840	At this moment the door was opened quickly and a messenger introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille gave a letter to the commiss	65.26683044433594
28570/28840	How What do you say Of whom do you speak It is not of my wife I hope   On the contrary it is of	36.36809158325195
28571/28840	The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux Let them be guarded more closely than	150.6293182373047
28572/28840	And yet said Athos with his habitual calmness if it be Monsieur dArtagnan who is concerned in this matter I do not perceive how I can take his	21.972393035888672
28573/28840	Do as I bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute	248.57940673828125
28574/28840	You understand   Athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while	82.26164245605469
28575/28840	Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a	258.96490478515625
28576/28840	They locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the	128.16233825683594
28577/28840	Bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed	728.6341552734375
28578/28840	In the evening about nine oclock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his	27.66411590576172
28579/28840	These steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards	56.35376739501953
28580/28840	Follow me said an officer who came up behind the	92.84858703613281
28581/28840	Follow you cried Bonacieux follow you at this hour Where my God   Where we have orders to lead	170.6686248779297
28582/28840	It is nevertheless the only one we can	100.12195587158203
28583/28840	Ah my God my God murmured the poor mercer now indeed I am lost And he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without	295.8077392578125
28584/28840	He passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horse	83.07097625732422
28585/28840	They made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling	124.89991760253906
28586/28840	The carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral	351.4090270996094
28587/28840	Through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all but true Parisian as he was Bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the	342.43603515625
28588/28840	At the moment of arriving at	177.87521362304688
28589/28840	Paulthe spot where such as were condemned at the Bastille were executedhe was near fainting and crossed himself	711.5394897460938
28590/28840	He thought the carriage was about to stop	60.69389343261719
28591/28840	Farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of	222.6495819091797
28592/28840	One thing however reassured him he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his	116.78799438476562
28593/28840	But when he saw the carriage take the way to La Grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the Hôtel de Ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with	87.92278289794922
28594/28840	He wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his	153.77911376953125
28595/28840	If they meant to execute him at La Grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of	241.2764434814453
28596/28840	Indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without	290.1631774902344
28597/28840	There remained then no other place to fear but the Traitors Cross the carriage was taking the direct road to	761.7596435546875
28598/28840	This time there was no longer any doubt it was at the Traitors Cross that lesser criminals were	787.239013671875
28599/28840	Bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of	163.7094268798828
28600/28840	Paul or of the Place de Grêve it was at the Traitors Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end He could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet	276.2188415527344
28601/28840	When he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage	22.780731201171875
28602/28840	This was more than poor Bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and f	103.55164337158203
28603/28840	THE MAN OF MEUNG     The crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was	549.141845703125
28604/28840	The carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the Rue	143.32046508789062
28605/28840	Honoré turned into the Rue des Bons Enfants and stopped before a low	33.42684555053711
28606/28840	The door opened two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported	202.25750732421875
28607/28840	They carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antech	78.91015625
28608/28840	All these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was	222.2117462158203
28609/28840	He had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a	402.55120849609375
28610/28840	His ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore	225.3822784423828
28611/28840	He remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed	59.70145797729492
28612/28840	At this movement which nobody opposed he resumed a little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the	187.38650512695312
28613/28840	At length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his	48.55859375
28614/28840	At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the	111.59994506835938
28615/28840	Yes Monsieur Officer stammered the mercer more dead than alive at your	321.44952392578125
28616/28840	And he moved out of the way to let the mercer	506.7596740722656
28617/28840	The latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be	61.90236282348633
28618/28840	It was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of	156.476318359375
28619/28840	A square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of La Rochelle occupied the center of the	301.5656433105469
28620/28840	Although this man was scarcely thirtysix or thirtyseven years of age hair mustaches and royal all began to be	309.4383239746094
28621/28840	This man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the	82.29075622558594
28622/28840	At first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they	81.75753784179688
28623/28840	The poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the	96.32239532470703
28624/28840	Is this that Bonacieux asked he after a moment of	144.16668701171875
28625/28840	Give me those papers and leave	581.2508544921875
28626/28840	The officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and	146.8578643798828
28627/28840	Bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the Bast	678.823974609375
28628/28840	From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mer	188.5907440185547
28629/28840	At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was	176.4884490966797
28630/28840	That head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will	153.71751403808594
28631/28840	You are accused of high treason said the cardinal	272.9775085449219
28632/28840	So I have been told already monseigneur cried Bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but I swear to you that I know nothing about	72.11559295654297
28633/28840	You have conspired with your wife with Madame de Chevreuse and with my Lord Duke of	76.4788818359375
28634/28840	Indeed monseigneur responded the mercer I have heard her pronounce all those	603.3760986328125
28635/28840	And on what occasion   She said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of Buckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the	44.91407012939453
28636/28840	She said that cried the cardinal with	333.94537353515625
28637/28840	Yes monseigneur but I told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his Eminence was incapable   Hold your tongue You are stupid replied the	87.52432250976562
28638/28840	Thats exactly what my wife said monseign	214.74362182617188
28639/28840	Do you know who carried off your wife   No monseign	37.681392669677734
28640/28840	You have suspicions nevertheless   Yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to Monsieur the Commissary and I no longer have	61.07878112792969
28641/28840	Did you know that   No monseign	21.629297256469727
28642/28840	I learned it since I have been in prison and that from the conversation of Monsieur the Commissaryan amiable	101.7568588256836
28643/28840	Then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her	52.79159164428711
28644/28840	Absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the Lou	41.962528228759766
28645/28840	At one oclock this morning she had not	49.67117691040039
28646/28840	My God What can have become of her then   We shall know be	74.05730438232422
28647/28840	Nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows	74.97726440429688
28648/28840	But monseigneur I know nothing about them I have never seen	18.64388084411621
28649/28840	When you went to fetch your wife from the Louvre did you always return directly home   Scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses I conducted	241.78445434570312
28650/28840	And how many were there of these linen drapers   Two monseign	213.1060028076172
28651/28840	And where did they live   One in Rue de Vaugirard the other Rue de la Har	84.63309478759766
28652/28840	Did you go into these houses with her   Never monseigneur I waited at the	61.392791748046875
28653/28840	And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone   She gave me none she told me to wait and I	158.63577270507812
28654/28840	You are a very complacent husband my dear Monsieur Bonacieux said the	58.967010498046875
28655/28840	He calls me his dear Monsieur said the mercer to	478.74853515625

28663/28840	Let him come in then said the cardinal	62.56139373779297
28664/28840	The officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying	78.3223648071289
28665/28840	To your Eminence murmured Bonacieux rolling his eyes round in aston	199.56619262695312
28666/28840	Five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage	184.82254028320312
28667/28840	Place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till I send for	70.27396392822266
28668/28840	No monseigneur no it is not he cried Bonacieux no I was	82.92474365234375
28669/28840	This is quite another man and does not resemble him at	52.59104537963867
28670/28840	Monsieur is I am sure an honest	36.35853576660156
28671/28840	Take away that fool said the	250.15516662597656
28672/28840	The officer took Bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two	37.12171173095703
28673/28840	The newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed They have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal	233.700439453125
28674/28840	The queen and the duke cried Richel	57.12665939331055
28675/28840	Are you sure of it   Perfectly	34.91121292114258
28676/28840	Who told you of it   Madame de Lannoy who is devoted to your Eminence as you	127.24212646484375
28677/28840	Why did she not let me know sooner   Whether by chance or mistrust the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all	335.5597839355469
28678/28840	Well we are beaten Now let us try to take our	48.421852111816406
28679/28840	I will assist you with all my heart monseigneur be assured of	25.156620025634766
28680/28840	How did it come about   At half past twelve the queen was with her women   Where   In her bedchamber   Go	70.26296997070312
28681/28840	When someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laund	93.39346313476562
28682/28840	And then   The queen immediately exhibited strong emotion and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale   And then and then   She then arose and with altered voice Ladies said she wait for me ten minutes I shall soon	236.9577178955078
28683/28840	She then opened the door of her alcove and went	67.16189575195312
28684/28840	Why did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly   Nothing was certain besides her Majesty had said Ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the	379.0368957519531
28685/28840	How long did the queen remain out of the chamber   Threequarters of an	79.37267303466797
28686/28840	None of her women accompanied her   Only Donna Estaf	6356.74560546875
28687/28840	Did she afterward return   Yes but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again	143.34095764160156
28688/28840	And when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her  	174.89137268066406
28689/28840	Does Madame de Lannoy know what was in that casket   Yes the diamond studs which his Majesty gave the	679.4804077148438
28690/28840	And she came back without this casket  	99.59233093261719
28691/28840	Madame de Lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to Buckingham   She is sure of	218.61952209472656
28692/28840	How can she be so   In the course of the day Madame de Lannoy in her quality of tirewoman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the	307.98779296875
28693/28840	And then the queen   The queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be	240.96429443359375
28694/28840	He must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or	149.72496032714844
28695/28840	And the goldsmith   The goldsmith has heard nothing of	373.6959228515625
28696/28840	Well well Rochefort all is not lost and perhapsperhaps everything is for the	198.88211059570312
28697/28840	The fact is that I do not doubt your Eminences genius   Will repair the blunders of his agentis that it   That is exactly what I was going to say if your Eminence had let me finish my	153.8182830810547
28698/28840	Meanwhile do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of Buckingham are now concealed   No monseigneur my people could tell me nothing on that	49.7920036315918
28699/28840	You monseigneur   Yes or at least I	25.048189163208008
28700/28840	They were one in the Rue de Vaugirard	55.639251708984375
28701/28840	25 the other in the Rue de la Harpe	278.2966003417969
28702/28840	Does your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested   It will be too late they will be	84.84162902832031
28703/28840	But still we can make sure that they are	119.71116638183594
28704/28840	Take ten men of my Guardsmen and search the two houses	864.0762329101562
28705/28840	And Rochefort went hastily out of the	62.32581329345703
28706/28840	The cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third	64.00811767578125
28707/28840	Bring the prisoner in again said the	223.27589416503906
28708/28840	Bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer	172.6568603515625
28709/28840	You have deceived me said the cardinal stern	139.48057556152344
28710/28840	I cried Bonacieux I deceive your Eminence   Your wife in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe did not go to find linen drap	338.8083801269531
28711/28840	Then why did she go just God   She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of	70.43357849121094
28712/28840	Yes cried Bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes thats	211.2469482421875
28713/28840	I told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those in houses that had no signs but she always laughed at	396.2501525878906
28714/28840	The cardinal has touched me with his hand I have touched the hand of the great man cried Bonacie	50.1683464050293
28715/28840	The great man has called me his friend   Yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemn	121.56085968017578
28716/28840	Here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon	68.58773040771484
28717/28840	I pardon you monseigneur said Bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasant	228.8395538330078
28718/28840	But you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged you are the master and I could not have the least word to	78.12657928466797
28719/28840	Pardon you monseigneur You cannot mean that   Ah my dear Monsieur Bonacieux you are generous in this	52.056427001953125
28720/28840	I see it and I thank you for	18.04697608947754
28721/28840	Thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too mal	194.50303649902344
28722/28840	Farewell then or rather _au revoir_ for I hope we shall meet	251.64739990234375
28723/28840	Whenever Monseigneur wishes I am always at at his Eminences	297.3120422363281
28724/28840	That will be frequently I assure you for I have found something extremely agreeable in your	166.63894653320312
28725/28840	Oh Monseigneur   _Au revoir_ Monsieur Bonacieux _au revoir_   And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which Bonacieux replied by bowing to the	53.710819244384766
28726/28840	Bonacieux and then when Bonacieuxs cries were no longer audible Good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for	161.2177734375
28727/28840	As he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and Rochefort	115.77928924560547
28728/28840	Well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the	67.61420440673828
28729/28840	Well said the latter a young woman of about twentysix or twentyeight years of age and a man of from thirtyfive to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence but the woman left last night and the man this	116.54271697998047
28730/28840	It was they cried the cardinal looking at the clock and now it is too late to have them	73.58859252929688
28731/28840	The duchess is at Tours and the duke at Boulog	30.825069427490234
28732/28840	It is in London they must be	92.24828338623047
28733/28840	What are your Eminences orders   Not a word of what has	155.0362091064453
28734/28840	Let the queen remain in perfect security let her be ignorant that we know her	338.0123596191406
28735/28840	Let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or	116.39022064208984
28736/28840	Send me the keeper of the seals Ségu	328.3116760253906
28737/28840	And that man what has your Eminence done with him   What man asked the	96.58201599121094
28738/28840	I have done with him all that could be	29.052553176879883
28739/28840	I have made him a spy upon his	53.5566291809082
28740/28840	The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and	89.8721694946289
28741/28840	Left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special	214.87185668945312
28742/28840	The officer entered for the fourth	198.96188354492188
28743/28840	Tell Vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a	123.44396209716797
28744/28840	An instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and	699.8907470703125
28745/28840	Vitray said he you will go with all speed to	147.53477478027344
28746/28840	You must not stop an instant on the	64.77847290039062
28747/28840	You will deliver this letter to Mil	114.83704376220703
28748/28840	Here is an order for two hundred pistoles call upon my treasurer and get the	154.46072387695312
28749/28840	You shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission	244.70709228515625
28750/28840	The messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and	53.14670181274414
28751/28840	Here is what the letter contained   MILADY Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be	494.01348876953125
28752/28840	He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs get as near to him as you can and cut off	451.3620910644531
28753/28840	As soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform	555.5391845703125
28754/28840	MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD     On the day after these events had taken place Athos not having reappeared	5943.3046875
28755/28840	de Tréville was informed by DArtagnan and Porthos of the	17.326799392700195
28756/28840	As to Aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to Rouen on family	145.8157958984375
28757/28840	de Tréville was the father of his	98.65072631835938
28758/28840	The lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own	71.34426879882812
28759/28840	He repaired then instantly to the office of the _lieutenantcriminel	1219.591064453125
28760/28840	The officer who commanded the post of the Red Cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos was then lodged in Fort lEvê	511.1535339355469
28761/28840	Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux	380.1870422363281
28762/28840	We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each	187.47821044921875
28763/28840	Athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that DArtagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was Athos and not DArtagn	50.3870735168457
28764/28840	He added that he did not know either	112.64478302001953
28765/28840	Bonacieux that he had never spoken to the one or the other that he had come at about ten oclock in the evening to pay a visit to his friend	25.092517852783203
28766/28840	dArtagnan but that till that hour he had been at	108.05362701416016
28767/28840	Twenty witnesses added he could attest the fact and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was	1357.0408935546875
28768/28840	de la Trémouille commanded a little	3531.88232421875
28769/28840	Athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the Louvre with the	37.626834869384766
28770/28840	It was precisely at this moment that	49.396610260009766
28771/28840	de Tréville on leaving the residence of the _lieutenantcriminel_ and the governor of Fort lEvêque without being able to find Athos arrived at the	167.8873748779297
28772/28840	de Tréville had the right of entry at all	85.0175552368164
28773/28840	It is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than	355.1558532714844
28774/28840	One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of Austria for M	346.05499267578125
28775/28840	These two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with Spain the quarrel with England or the embarrassment of the	194.6568603515625
28776/28840	In his eyes and to his conviction M	573.3750610351562
28777/28840	de Chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrig	138.31932067871094
28778/28840	At the first word the cardinal spoke of M	202.32620239257812
28779/28840	de Chevreusewho though exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city had come to Paris remained there five days and outwitted the policethe king flew into a furious	810.419677734375
28780/28840	Capricious and unfaithful the king wished to be called Louis the Just and Louis the Ch	716.8323364257812
28781/28840	Posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by	2460.068115234375
28782/28840	But when the cardinal added that not only M	571.1331176757812
28783/28840	could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queens apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless	257.1120300292969
28784/28840	And yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of	66.62237548828125
28785/28840	de Tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable	561.7008056640625
28786/28840	Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the kings countenance	149.64715576171875
28787/28840	de Tréville felt himself something like Samson before the Philist	2088.546630859375
28788/28840	had already placed his hand on the knob of the door at the noise of	59.27519607543945
28789/28840	You arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble I have learned some fine things concerning your Musket	190.33450317382812
28790/28840	And I said Tréville coldly I have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gowns	481.6241760253906
28791/28840	I have the honor to inform your Majesty continued	168.626708984375
28792/28840	Athos said the king mechanically yes certainly I know that	189.2805633544922
28793/28840	Let your Majesty remember said Tréville that Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so	209.55514526367188
28794/28840	_A propos_ monseigneur continued Tréville addressing the cardinal Monsieur de Cahusac is quite recovered is he not   Thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with	92.98128509521484
28795/28840	We all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our	138.230712890625
28796/28840	A written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his Majesty and the illtreated people have drawn up the following which I have the honor to present to your	449.7578430175781
28797/28840	And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman replied Tréville haught	149.60107421875
28798/28840	Come come Tréville hold your tongue said the	216.38702392578125
28799/28840	If his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my Musketeers said Tréville the justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so well known that I demand an	84.70633697509766
28800/28840	In the house in which the judicial inquiry was made continued the impassive cardinal there lodges I believe a young Béarnais a friend of the Musket	362.612548828125
28801/28840	I mean a young man whom you patronize Monsieur de Tré	20.9788875579834
28802/28840	Yes your Eminence it is the	62.0854606628418
28803/28840	Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel   To Athos to a man double his age interrupted Tré	170.2102508544922
28804/28840	Besides DArtagnan passed the evening with	50.352970123291016
28805/28840	Well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with	112.99919891357422
28806/28840	Does your Eminence doubt my word said Tréville with a brow flushed with	225.81248474121094
28807/28840	At what hour did he leave your hôtel   At half past tenan hour after the	536.0216064453125
28808/28840	Well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of Tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but Athos _was_ taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoye	96.90303802490234
28809/28840	Is one friend forbidden to visit another or a Musketeer of my company to fraternize with a Guard of Dessessarts company   Yes when the house where he fraternizes is	2267.066650390625
28810/28840	That house is suspected Tréville said the king perhaps you did not know it   Indeed sire I did	60.94260025024414
28811/28840	Was it not this DArtagnan who wounded Jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the CarmesDéchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vex	392.6209716796875
28812/28840	Yes sire yes it is the same and your Majesty has a good	131.08311462402344
28813/28840	Come how shall we decide said the	73.26228332519531
28814/28840	That concerns your Majesty more than me said the	770.1303100585938
28815/28840	But his Majesty has judges and these judges will	6820.7216796875
