1/3605	Nothing could turn him from his	210.03672790527344
2/3605	Honoré and in the Place du PalaisCardinal they found the twelve invited Musketeers walking about in expectation of their	516.6895751953125
3/3605	There only they explained to them the matter in	336.2634582519531
4/3605	DArtagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings Musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a	92.53486633300781
5/3605	Athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to Aramis and the third to Porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an	209.77569580078125
6/3605	DArtagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal	111.88106536865234
7/3605	Although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by	95.37991333007812
8/3605	His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the	275.3679504394531
9/3605	Still further De Wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his Eminence and DArtagnan knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his	110.07520294189453
10/3605	If De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable I may consider myself almost as a condemned man said DArtagnan shaking his	116.28414916992188
11/3605	But why has he waited till now Thats all plain	1053.528564453125
12/3605	Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup	818.362548828125
13/3605	Fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a	57.56002426147461
14/3605	Nevertheless Monsieur de Trévilles company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all France and before whom the queen is without power and the king without	149.9002685546875
15/3605	DArtagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you   He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antech	58.80620193481445
16/3605	He placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the	71.0452880859375
17/3605	In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards who recognized DArtagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded Jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular	151.98355102539062
18/3605	This smile appeared to DArtagnan to be of bad aug	60.42058181762695
19/3605	The usher returned and made a sign to DArtagnan to follow	22.882509231567383
20/3605	It appeared to the young man that the Guards on seeing him depart chuckled among	1309.722900390625
21/3605	He traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and	176.12393188476562
22/3605	The usher introduced him and retired without speaking a	262.2286376953125
23/3605	DArtagnan remained standing and examined this	48.41685485839844
24/3605	DArtagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his	381.4290771484375
25/3605	He saw then that he was with a	139.25735473632812
26/3605	At the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written Mirame a Tragedy in Five Acts and raised his	934.7776489257812
27/3605	A TERRIBLE VISION     The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a	400.0925598144531
28/3605	No one had a more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu and DArtagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a	61.63789367675781
29/3605	He however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence without too much assurance but also without too much	154.51686096191406
30/3605	Monsieur said the cardinal are you a DArtagnan from Béarn   Yes monseigneur replied the young	42.29033660888672
31/3605	It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital   Yes monseign	39.26559066772461
32/3605	You came through Meung where something befell	2898.690673828125
33/3605	I dont very well know what but still	252.56019592285156
34/3605	Monseigneur said DArtagnan this was what happened to me   Never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate	29.400676727294922
35/3605	You were recommended to Monsieur de Tréville were you not   Yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at Meung   The letter was lost replied his Eminence yes I know	45.350162506103516
36/3605	Since that time many things have happened to	61.945796966552734
37/3605	You were walking one day behind the Chartreux when it would have been better if you had been	161.78431701660156
38/3605	Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of Forges they stopped on the road but you continued	352.983642578125
39/3605	That is all very simple you had business in	206.46119689941406
40/3605	Monseigneur said DArtagnan quite confused I went   Hunting at Windsor or elsewherethat concerns	789.0636596679688
41/3605	I know because it is my office to know	83.09209442138672
42/3605	On your return you were received by an august personage and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave	203.74111938476562
43/3605	DArtagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too	47.46448516845703
44/3605	The day after that you received a visit from Cavois resumed the	700.638427734375
45/3605	He went to desire you to come to the	91.69186401367188
46/3605	You have not returned that visit and you were	153.55825805664062
47/3605	Monseigneur I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Emin	291.8495788574219
48/3605	As a proof remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very	79.82179260253906
49/3605	That was the very evening when the abduction of M	314.4527893066406
50/3605	DArtagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her	73.65431213378906
51/3605	In short continued the cardinal as I have heard nothing of you for some time past I wished to know what you were	49.81785202026367
52/3605	You must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the	105.92973327636719
53/3605	That continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect to	288.7029113769531
54/3605	I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation but you did not	55.800052642822266
55/3605	Fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear	74.66206359863281
56/3605	Sit down there before me DArtagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen	185.03868103027344
57/3605	And the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he ob	68.89151763916016
58/3605	You are brave Monsieur dArtagnan continued his Eminence you are prudent which is still	44.67807388305664
59/3605	I like men of head and	819.8444213867188
60/3605	By men of heart I mean men of	578.8154907226562
61/3605	But young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy	176.26431274414062
62/3605	Alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while I am	76.52930450439453
63/3605	Yes thats true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more I dont	206.26300048828125
64/3605	Yet you have need I believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if I mistake not you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your	118.5255355834961
65/3605	I am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said DArtagn	30.743732452392578
66/3605	There are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of	115.60710906982422
67/3605	Now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my Guards and a company after the campaign   Ah monseign	270.6351013183594
68/3605	You accept it do you not   Monseigneur replied DArtagnan with an embarrassed	17.367036819458008
69/3605	How You refuse cried the cardinal with aston	187.6644287109375
70/3605	I am in his Majestys Guards monseigneur and I have no reason to be	190.071044921875
71/3605	But it appears to me that my Guardsmineare also his Majestys Guards and whoever serves in a French corps serves the	2699.901123046875
72/3605	Monseigneur your Eminence has ill understood my	585.9297485351562
73/3605	You want a pretext do you not I	594.2411499023438
74/3605	Well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which I offer youso much for the	938.8148803710938
75/3605	As regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know Monsieur dArtagnan that I have received heavy and serious complaints against	167.3944091796875
76/3605	You do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings	1003.679931640625
77/3605	In fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers I have here a whole pile which concerns	82.03465270996094
78/3605	I know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to	162.86904907226562
79/3605	Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of	65.69734954833984
80/3605	Monseigneur your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary I think I have not proved myself worthy of your	63.16443634033203
81/3605	The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed monseign	82.37488555908203
82/3605	I shall serve under the eye of your Eminence and if I have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor	103.92130279541016
83/3605	Everything is best in its time monseign	215.41506958007812
84/3605	Hereafter perhaps I shall have the right of _giving_ myself at present I shall appear to sell	146.2493438720703
85/3605	That is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympath	107.25243377685547
86/3605	Monseigneur   Well well said the cardinal I dont wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our	61.1663932800293
87/3605	We owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself Monsieur dArtagnan for from the moment I withdraw my hand from behind you I would not give an _obolus_ for your	71.14730072021484
88/3605	I will try to do so monseigneur replied the Gascon with a noble	27.082317352294922
89/3605	Remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said Richelieu significantly that it was I who came to seek you and that I did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling	70.33209228515625
90/3605	I shall entertain whatever may happen said DArtagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your Eminence for that which you now do for	68.40312194824219
91/3605	Well let it be then as you have said Monsieur dArtagnan we shall see each other again after the	16.473323822021484
92/3605	Remain neutral monseigneur if you find that I act as becomes a gallant	516.805908203125
93/3605	Young man said Richelieu if I shall be able to say to you at another time what I have said to you today I promise you to do	24.46478271484375
94/3605	This last expression of Richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed DArtagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a	165.80242919921875
95/3605	The cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened	260.2286376953125
96/3605	He opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed	67.17650604248047
97/3605	DArtagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to	30.087642669677734
98/3605	Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required Athos would no more give him his handAthos would renounce	125.6977767944336
99/3605	It was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds	285.4790344238281
100/3605	DArtagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow	68.0411605834961
101/3605	With a word DArtagnan reassured them and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the PalaisCard	129.80929565429688
102/3605	Returned home with Athos Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but DArtagnan confined himself to telling them that	112.73247528076172
103/3605	de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had	69.98716735839844
104/3605	And you were right cried Aramis and Porthos with one	36.37445068359375
105/3605	Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered	80.96482849121094
106/3605	But when they were alone he said You have done that which you ought to have done DArtagnan but perhaps you have been	31.27838706970215
107/3605	DArtagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited	77.37382507324219
108/3605	The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for	94.61432647705078
109/3605	DArtagnan went to take leave of	20.08148193359375
110/3605	At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day	284.00872802734375
111/3605	de Tréville contented himself with asking DArtagnan if he could do anything for him but DArtagnan answered that he was supplied with all he	41.680885314941406
112/3605	That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of	1487.78564453125
113/3605	Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of	366.5038146972656
114/3605	de Tréville who had been accustomed to associate	115.26786804199219
115/3605	They were parting to meet again when it pleased God and if it pleased	561.33447265625
116/3605	That night then was somewhat riotous as may be	1154.817626953125
117/3605	In such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme care	392.144775390625
118/3605	At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the Musketeers hastening to the hôtel of	193.21075439453125

120/3605	Each of the captains then led his company to the Louvre where the king held his	129.684326171875
121/3605	The king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty	932.1497192382812

124/3605	The review over the Guards set forward alone on their march the Musketeers waiting for the king which allowed Porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux O	266.44781494140625
125/3605	The procurators wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine	752.5686645507812
126/3605	She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus she made him a sign to dismount and come to	110.34637451171875

145/3605	THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE     The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis	2569.050537109375
146/3605	and one of the great military enterprises of the	145.05911254882812
147/3605	It is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in	253.39918518066406
148/3605	The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were	1259.6533203125
149/3605	Let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the	490.58807373046875

154/3605	La Rochelle which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities was then the focus of dissensions and	871.4190673828125
155/3605	Moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English and by closing it against England our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Gu	265.58221435546875

160/3605	On his side Buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of England was moved by interests exactly like those of the	483.50250244140625

180/3605	From the time of his arrival in Paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or	74.57962036132812

189/3605	Now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a	97.76347351074219
190/3605	DArtagnan had a quick eye and a prompt	69.94364166259766
191/3605	He comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly	169.2133331298828
192/3605	He determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another mus	63.23884582519531
193/3605	The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the	51.29020690917969
194/3605	At the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his	40.74528884887695
195/3605	DArtagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the	38.894325256347656
196/3605	DArtagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single	60.55787658691406

202/3605	The ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus	528.7694702148438

215/3605	At nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to	237.76742553710938
216/3605	The guards were under arms and DArtagnan took his place in the midst of his	17.54468536376953
217/3605	Monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments	131.3032684326172
218/3605	Dessessart captain of the Guards as well as the	1440.8463134765625
219/3605	At the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to DArtagnan that	66.45491027832031
220/3605	Dessessart made him a sign to	670.5335693359375
221/3605	He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive	121.41567993164062
222/3605	Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in	61.85371017456055
223/3605	Thanks my captain replied DArtagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant	59.27963638305664
224/3605	In fact the Rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days	295.76751708984375
225/3605	The matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bast	2039.5224609375
226/3605	At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice and said I want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended	168.647216796875
227/3605	As to the man to be depended upon I have him under my hand monsieur said	91.81790924072266

229/3605	Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said DArtagnan raising his	71.06402587890625
230/3605	Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed	522.2457275390625
231/3605	DArtagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the	224.61764526367188
232/3605	It was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the	318.2465515136719
233/3605	DArtagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two Guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed	168.1762237548828
234/3605	They arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bast	219.943603515625
235/3605	There on turning round DArtagnan perceived that the two soldiers had	24.551729202270508
236/3605	He thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to	153.64886474609375
237/3605	At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bast	302.1461181640625
238/3605	They saw no one and the bastion seemed	449.5933837890625
239/3605	The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around DArtagnan and his	482.99835205078125
240/3605	They knew all they wished to know the bastion was	149.08998107910156
241/3605	A longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless impr	251.2884063720703
242/3605	DArtagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a	61.283546447753906
243/3605	On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the Guardsmen	172.58090209960938
244/3605	A ball had passed through his	126.54851531982422
245/3605	The other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the	195.55137634277344
246/3605	DArtagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were	75.08509826660156
247/3605	One ball struck the head of the alreadywounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of DArtagn	264.3996276855469
248/3605	The young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the	121.20004272460938
249/3605	The idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings	216.87303161621094
250/3605	He resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were	54.53496170043945
251/3605	He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two	458.8792419433594
252/3605	DArtagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the	86.67350006103516
253/3605	As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making	124.56588745117188
254/3605	Fortunately deceived by DArtagnans trick they neglected to reload their	567.9359130859375
255/3605	When they were within ten paces of him DArtagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to	58.983577728271484
256/3605	The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the	225.5202178955078
257/3605	One of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a	179.60887145996094
258/3605	He aimed a terrible blow at DArtagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bast	100.33860778808594
259/3605	As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his	140.48399353027344
260/3605	Meantime DArtagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his	69.96421813964844
261/3605	The conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arqu	567.1500244140625
262/3605	The sword of the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who	1019.2445068359375
263/3605	DArtagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his	25.626075744628906
264/3605	Oh do not kill me cried the band	34.943382263183594
265/3605	Pardon pardon my officer and I will tell you	95.44856262207031
266/3605	Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his	328.58843994140625
267/3605	Yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you	142.35153198242188
268/3605	Wretch cried DArtagnan speak quickly Who employed you to assassinate me   A woman whom I dont know but who is called Mil	60.355533599853516
269/3605	But if you dont know this woman how do you know her name   My comrade knows her and called her	71.39940643310547
270/3605	It was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as I have heard him	149.20761108398438
271/3605	But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair   He proposed to me to undertake it with him and I	93.64903259277344
272/3605	And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise   A hundred lou	58.05801773071289
273/3605	Well come said the young man laughing she thinks I am worth	88.61897277832031
274/3605	A hundred louis Well that was a temptation for two wretches like	231.59400939941406
275/3605	I understand why you accepted it and I grant you my pardon but upon one	172.6734161376953
276/3605	What is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not	96.76428985595703
277/3605	That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his	44.63881301879883
278/3605	But cried the bandit that is only another way of killing	84.39131164550781
279/3605	How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion   You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or I swear you shall die by my	53.36385726928711
280/3605	Pardon monsieur pity In the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his handfor he began to lose his strength with his	94.35099792480469
281/3605	And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love and that I believed that woman dead asked DArtagn	36.85643005371094
282/3605	By that letter which my comrade has in his	160.0013885498047
283/3605	You see then said DArtagnan that I must have that	43.41976547241211
284/3605	Stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of	518.2680053710938
285/3605	I will goI will go   DArtagnan took the soldiers arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his	145.82289123535156
286/3605	It was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from	109.26020812988281
287/3605	Terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that DArtagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt Stop said he I will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as	47.97015380859375
288/3605	Stay where you are I will go	93.11265563964844
289/3605	And with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground DArtagnan succeeded in reaching the second	96.20640563964844
290/3605	There were two means of gaining his objectto search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the	410.036376953125
291/3605	DArtagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy	286.7103576660156
292/3605	A slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to DArtagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his	245.42283630371094
293/3605	DArtagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as	113.89241790771484
294/3605	A leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead	155.7701873779297
295/3605	He left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocket	130.79983520507812
296/3605	If you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from	127.58357238769531
297/3605	Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Mil	185.70913696289062
298/3605	He consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded	169.7117462158203
299/3605	But what were you to do with that woman asked DArtagnan with	27.772375106811523
300/3605	We were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the Place Royale said the wounded	100.279052734375
301/3605	There could be no doubt she owed this information to the	185.2098388671875
302/3605	But amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor M	180.16720581054688
303/3605	Bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of Chaillot like an apparition were now	174.18228149414062
304/3605	Then also as Athos had predicted it became possible to find M	243.9769287109375
305/3605	Bonacieux and a convent was not impregn	90.60775756835938
306/3605	This idea completely restored clemency to his	633.11865234375
307/3605	He turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said Come I will not abandon you	55.3232421875
308/3605	Lean upon me and let us return to the	55.739097595214844
309/3605	Yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged   You have my word said he for the second time I give you your	59.29456329345703
310/3605	The wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but DArtagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his	197.74131774902344
311/3605	The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four	215.9144287109375
312/3605	They were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and	127.22301483154297
313/3605	DArtagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_ which he	425.41302490234375
314/3605	He described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had	181.93508911132812
315/3605	This recital was for him the occasion of veritable	369.0628356933594
316/3605	The whole army talked of this expedition for a day and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon	155.89198303222656
317/3605	Besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of DArtagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had	397.6688537597656
318/3605	In fact DArtagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his	54.03395080566406
319/3605	This tranquillity proved one thingthat DArtagnan did not yet know Mil	79.54396057128906
320/3605	Martin and the fort of La Prée as on their side the French were besieging La Roc	1464.357177734375
321/3605	DArtagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have	182.32669067382812
322/3605	He only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his	118.89153289794922
323/3605	But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything was explained to him by this letter dated from Villeroy  	93.2916259765625
324/3605	They are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite	127.23533630371094
325/3605	I have done this and am monsieur with great respect     Your very humble and obedient servant GODEAU _Purveyor of the Musketeers_     Thats all well cried DArtagn	319.4654846191406
326/3605	They think of me in their pleasures as I thought of them in my	206.8649444580078
327/3605	Well I will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but I will not drink	64.81090545654297
328/3605	And DArtagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from Viller	275.7570495605469
329/3605	One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after	186.0469207763672
330/3605	The hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the	193.75997924804688
331/3605	Planchet waited towel on arm Fourreau uncorked the bottles and Brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decan	2039.0101318359375
332/3605	Of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom Brisemont poured the lees into a glass and DArtagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his	373.73419189453125
333/3605	The guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis and Fort Ne	407.3182678222656
334/3605	The Guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the English sprang to their	673.8809204101562
335/3605	DArtagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their	114.21944427490234
336/3605	But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this	100.7943115234375
337/3605	Cries of Live the king Live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all	278.2570495605469
338/3605	In short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand	568.1113891601562
339/3605	DArtagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and	173.59075927734375
340/3605	de Tréville who detected him at	154.27044677734375
341/3605	The ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers	547.5591430664062
342/3605	_Pardieu_ cried DArtagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner cannot have had time to get cold Can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two Guards whom he introduced to his	121.8687515258789
343/3605	Ah ah said Porthos it appears we are feasting   I hope said Aramis there are no women at your	44.78781509399414
344/3605	Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked Ath	889.507568359375
345/3605	Well _pardieu_ there is yours my dear friend replied DArtagn	36.05430603027344
346/3605	We sent you wine   You know very wellthe wine from the hills of Anj	475.8785095214844
347/3605	Yes I know what brand you are talking	143.7587127685547
348/3605	Well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with	267.1922302246094
349/3605	And so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some Anjou wine said Porth	214.9544677734375
350/3605	Not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your	319.9621887207031
351/3605	On our account said the three Musket	226.93812561035156
352/3605	Did you send this wine Aramis said Ath	114.33644104003906
353/3605	No and you Porthos   No and you Athos   No   If it was not you it was your purveyor said DArtagn	27.979469299316406
354/3605	Our purveyor   Yes your purveyor Godeauthe purveyor of the Musket	180.3218994140625
355/3605	My faith never mind where it comes from said Porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink	91.468017578125
356/3605	No said Athos dont let us drink wine which comes from an unknown	119.6708755493164
357/3605	Did none of you charge your purveyor Godeau to send me some wine   No And yet you say he has sent you some as from us   Here is his letter said DArtagnan and he presented the note to his	116.01675415039062
358/3605	This is not his writing said Ath	66.92877960205078
359/3605	I am acquainted with it before we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the	135.6039581298828
360/3605	A false letter altogether said Porthos we have not been	502.8851013183594
361/3605	DArtagnan said Aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance   DArtagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his	34.26873016357422
362/3605	DArtagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three Musketeers and the two Guards following	208.26174926757812
363/3605	The first object that met the eyes of DArtagnan on entering the room was Brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convuls	280.4363708496094
364/3605	Planchet and Fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was uselessall the features of the dying man were distorted with	191.51712036132812
365/3605	Ah cried he on perceiving DArtagnan ah this is frightful You pretend to pardon me and you poison me   I cried DArtagn	36.012516021728516
366/3605	I wretch What do you say   I say that it was you who gave me the wine I say that it was you who desired me to drink	20.421981811523438
367/3605	I say you wished to avenge yourself on me and I say that it is horrible   Do not think so Brisemont said DArtagnan do not think	60.06853485107422
368/3605	I do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tort	172.1275634765625
369/3605	Frightful frightful murmured Athos while Porthos broke the bottles and Aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent	101.01400756835938
370/3605	Oh my friends said DArtagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these	49.025794982910156
371/3605	Gentlemen continued he addressing the Guardsmen I request you will be silent with regard to this	378.2543640136719
372/3605	Great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon	302.6553039550781
373/3605	Alas said Fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror I wanted to get him out of the way that I might drink	160.7284393310547
374/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan addressing the Guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day I beg of	170.60922241210938
375/3605	The two Guardsmen courteously accepted DArtagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone	182.32321166992188
376/3605	When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their	125.54999542236328
377/3605	In the first place said Athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent	133.34852600097656
378/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan I commit the corpse of this poor devil to your	31.344066619873047
379/3605	Let him be interred in holy	428.2430725097656
380/3605	He committed a crime it is true but he repented of	245.4796142578125
381/3605	And the four friends quit the room leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisem	2059.864501953125
382/3605	The host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which Athos went himself to draw at the	275.4551696777344
383/3605	In a few words Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the	32.04283905029297
384/3605	Well said DArtagnan to Athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the	20.97966766357422
385/3605	Yes yes replied he I perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she   I am sure of	23.076263427734375
386/3605	But the _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder   She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France and has been branded in	219.8971405029297
387/3605	Athos she is your wife I tell you repeated DArtagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each	229.71022033691406
388/3605	Yes but I should think the other must be dead I hanged her so effect	177.68997192382812
389/3605	It was DArtagnan who now shook his head in his	16.466768264770508
390/3605	But in either case what is to be done said the young	25.8482723236084
391/3605	The fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said Ath	233.25387573242188
392/3605	We must extricate ourselves from this	241.3719482421875
393/3605	But how   Listen You must try to see her and have an explanation with	74.08548736572266
394/3605	Say to her Peace or war My word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to	262.5903625488281
395/3605	I like the means well enough said DArtagnan but where and how to meet with her   Time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of	666.5560913085938
396/3605	The more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to	260.877685546875
397/3605	Yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poison	1046.7845458984375
398/3605	God has preserved us hitherto God will preserve us	1231.964599609375
399/3605	Besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but _she_ asked he in an undert	133.73883056640625
400/3605	Madame Bonacieux Ah thats true said Ath	81.54608917236328
401/3605	My poor friend I had forgotten you were in	91.38753509521484
402/3605	I am only temporarily a Musketeer said Aramis hum	144.5676727294922
403/3605	It is some time since we heard from his mistress said Athos in a low	33.26947784423828
404/3605	But take no notice we know all about	106.99652099609375
405/3605	Well said Porthos it appears to me that the means are very	24.919071197509766
406/3605	You say she is in a convent replied Porth	56.3837890625
407/3605	As soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that	1113.702392578125
408/3605	But we must first learn what convent she is	251.26083374023438
409/3605	But I think I have it said Ath	27.55260467529297
410/3605	Dont you say dear DArtagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her   I believe so at	30.3577938079834
411/3605	In that case Porthos will assist	48.98904037475586
412/3605	And how so if you please   Why by your marchioness your duchess your	104.25120544433594
413/3605	Hush said Porthos placing a finger on his	36.214622497558594
414/3605	I believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the	119.82772827148438
415/3605	Then said Aramis I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of	91.19473266601562
416/3605	You And how   By the queens almoner to whom I am very intimately allied said Aramis	554.5377197265625
417/3605	And on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that	160.10195922851562
418/3605	DArtagnan returned to less important affairs and the three Musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their	139.08673095703125
419/3605	Bassompierre and Schomberg against the Duc dAngoulê	5632.45166015625
420/3605	The result was that to prevent	5863.697265625
421/3605	Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to	2152.74609375
422/3605	Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between Leu and Dompierre the Duc dAngoulême on the east from Dompierre to Perigny and	423.632080078125
423/3605	de Schomberg on the south from Perigny to Angout	4847.14892578125
424/3605	The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at Estrée sometimes at Jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of La Pierre in a simple house without any entrench	1200.010986328125
425/3605	So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre the king the Duc dAngoulême and the cardinal	297.9303894042969
426/3605	As soon as this organization was established they set about driving the English from the	985.5186157226562
427/3605	The English who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their	1591.3079833984375
428/3605	The result was that even if the kings troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other Buckingham who only continued in the Isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the	199.600341796875
429/3605	de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive	160.51979064941406
430/3605	Simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre	125.2292251586914
431/3605	Te Deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout	7880.54052734375
432/3605	The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the	129.6877899169922
433/3605	But it must be acknowledged this response was but moment	783.6637573242188
434/3605	An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham named Montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire Spain England and Lor	750.690673828125
435/3605	Still further in Buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised M	1740.2994384765625
436/3605	It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without	415.5888671875
437/3605	All therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of	299.02227783203125
438/3605	The cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of	276.5994873046875
439/3605	If the league which threatened France triumphed all his influence would be	987.450439453125
440/3605	Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre where they had as yet but partisans and he Richelieuthe French minister the national ministerwould be	1344.388916015625
441/3605	The king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the	102.05935668945312
442/3605	He would then be lost and France perhaps with	174.16384887695312
443/3605	Courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre in which the cardinal had established his	318.9922180175781
444/3605	There were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been	336.976806640625
445/3605	It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies	359.29107666015625
446/3605	On their part the Musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous	188.24249267578125
447/3605	This was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of	272.47979736328125
448/3605	de Tréville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the	403.134765625
449/3605	They immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the	409.8315124511719
450/3605	In an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go	97.697021484375
451/3605	The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and Athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice Who goes there   Who goes there yourselves replied one of the horse	111.64066314697266
452/3605	That is not an answer replied Ath	48.36479949951172
453/3605	Who goes there Answer or we	1470.575927734375
454/3605	Beware of what you are about gentlemen said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to	247.81521606445312
455/3605	It is some superior officer making his night rounds said Ath	878.2013549804688
456/3605	What do you wish gentlemen   Who are you said the same voice in the same commanding	56.28595733642578
457/3605	Answer in your turn or you may repent of your	256.91522216796875
458/3605	Kings Musketeers said Athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do	58.2869758605957
459/3605	What company   Company of Tré	298.7297058105469
460/3605	Advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this	112.74629211425781
461/3605	The three companions advanced rather humblyfor all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselvesleaving Athos the post of	518.8616943359375
462/3605	One of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his	91.2659912109375
463/3605	Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced	27.999649047851562
464/3605	Your pardon my officer said Athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good	90.15154266357422
465/3605	Your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his	108.67509460449219
466/3605	But yourself monsieur said Athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me I beg you the proof that you have the right to question	45.048179626464844
467/3605	Your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face	243.9571533203125
468/3605	Monsieur the Cardinal cried the stupefied Musket	63.963966369628906
469/3605	Your name cried his Eminence for the third	272.8745422363281
470/3605	The cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew	55.890960693359375
471/3605	These three Musketeers shall follow us said he in an undert	118.0611343383789
472/3605	I am not willing it should be known I have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell	100.43807220458984
473/3605	We are gentlemen monseigneur said Athos require our parole and give yourself no uneas	97.34110260009766
474/3605	Thank God we can keep a	637.4702758789062
475/3605	The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous	555.7733764648438
476/3605	You have a quick ear Monsieur Athos said the cardinal but now listen to	66.03797149658203
477/3605	It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow me but for my	125.7393798828125
478/3605	Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and Aram	80.77140808105469
479/3605	Yes your Eminence said Athos while the two Musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in	191.09193420410156
480/3605	I know you gentlemen said the cardinal I know	27.011566162109375
481/3605	I know you are not quite my friends and I am sorry you are not so but I know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in	39.38167953491211
482/3605	Monsieur Athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty if we should meet	58.44834518432617
483/3605	The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their	133.31007385253906
484/3605	Well upon my honor said Athos your Eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several illlooking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those	167.52328491210938
485/3605	A quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know I dont like quarrel	380.7892150878906
486/3605	And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in	73.24342346191406
487/3605	What have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his	73.37094116210938
488/3605	My friend Aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your Eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your Eminence orders an escal	482.7920227050781
489/3605	But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the	302.47540283203125
490/3605	Come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody Confess you know I have the right of giving abs	324.5571594238281
491/3605	I did not even draw my sword but I took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the	71.73643493652344
492/3605	It appears that in falling continued Athos with some hesitation he broke his	200.61244201660156
493/3605	Ah ah said the cardinal and you Monsieur Porthos   I monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibitedI seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder is	102.66522979736328
494/3605	Then I admit my patience failed me I drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his	66.8453140258789
495/3605	I only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two	75.4327621459961
496/3605	The devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed _hors de combat_ in a cabaret squabble You dont do your work by	661.8058471679688
497/3605	And pray what was this quarrel about   These fellows were drunk said Athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her	138.03494262695312
498/3605	Force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose   To do her violence without doubt said Ath	92.8065414428711
499/3605	I have had the honor of informing your Eminence that these men were	72.32672882080078
500/3605	And was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of	92.19705200195312
501/3605	We did not see her monseigneur said Ath	19.65740203857422
502/3605	You did not see her Ah very well replied the cardinal	74.29984283447266
503/3605	You did well to defend the honor of a woman and as I am going to the Red Dovecot myself I shall know if you have told me the	117.4528579711914
504/3605	Monseigneur said Athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a	49.236656188964844
505/3605	Judge not rashly says the Gospel replied the	548.4480590820312
506/3605	And now gentlemen thats well continued the	284.2249450683594
507/3605	I know what I wish to know follow	52.90403366088867
508/3605	The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four	91.37415313720703
509/3605	They soon arrived at the silent solitary	588.3060913085938
510/3605	No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the	1399.0108642578125
511/3605	Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to	57.872501373291016
512/3605	A saddled horse was fastened to the window	278.73895263671875
513/3605	The cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar	138.9091033935547
514/3605	A man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of Surgères which was likewise the way to	107.50563049316406
515/3605	You have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the Musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to	105.2064208984375
516/3605	The cardinal alighted the three Musketeers did	151.30679321289062
517/3605	The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shut	41.734413146972656
518/3605	For him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a	329.76300048828125
519/3605	Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the	156.94012451171875
520/3605	The host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chim	57.16919708251953
521/3605	Enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me I shall not be more than half an	24.505332946777344
522/3605	And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to	98.5032730102539
523/3605	Now who was that someone That was the question the three Musketeers put to one	191.12985229492188
524/3605	Then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject Porthos called the host and asked for	281.913330078125
525/3605	Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to	16.48926544189453
526/3605	Athos walked about in a contemplative	2196.282470703125
527/3605	While thinking and walking Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his	244.66485595703125
528/3605	Athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower or	137.25416564941406
529/3605	Listen Milady said the cardinal the affair is	87.33887481689453
530/3605	Sit down and let us talk it	122.81848907470703
531/3605	I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the Musketeer	215.6403350830078
532/3605	A small vessel with an English crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of Charente at Fort La Point	538.5274047851562
533/3605	Fort La Pointe or Fort Vasou was not built until 1672 nearly 50 years	26495.306640625
534/3605	I must go thither tonight   Instantly That is to say when you have received my	71.1656265258789
535/3605	Two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as	171.50326538085938
536/3605	You will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your	41.269100189208984
537/3605	Now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of your Eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that I may not commit an	117.03585052490234
538/3605	There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocut	85.2479248046875
539/3605	It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be	163.39170837402344
540/3605	Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with	61.7540397644043
541/3605	The two Musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Ath	156.98008728027344
542/3605	All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the	156.74888610839844
543/3605	You will go to London continued the	82.87505340576172
544/3605	Arrived in London you will seek	2649.600341796875
545/3605	I must beg your Eminence to observe said Milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his Grace distrusts	420.10150146484375
546/3605	Well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a	311.7386169433594
547/3605	Frankly and loyally repeated Milady with an unspeakable expression of dupl	521.051513671875
548/3605	Yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same	302.3075256347656
549/3605	All this negotiation must be carried on	1106.6939697265625
550/3605	I will follow your Eminences instructions to the	300.93804931640625
551/3605	I only wait till you give	165.5320281982422
552/3605	You will go to Buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him I am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes I will ruin the	74.51570129394531
553/3605	Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made   Yes for I have the	212.0976104736328
554/3605	I must be able to present these proofs for his	317.4429931640625
555/3605	And you will tell him I will publish the report of BoisRobert and the Marquis de Beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a mas	284.596923828125
556/3605	You will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the Great Mogul which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pist	90.58550262451172
557/3605	Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power that Montague is in the Bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not	352.5863037109375
558/3605	You recollect perfectly all I have told you do you not   Your Eminence will judge the ball of Madame the Constable the night at the Louvre the evening at Amiens the arrest of Montague the letter of Madame de Chevre	156.5966339111328
559/3605	Thats it said the cardinal thats	340.0087585449219
560/3605	But resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace France   The duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied Richelieu with great	216.61546325683594
561/3605	Like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady	803.2073364257812
562/3605	If he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says I will answer for it he will look	106.86735534667969
563/3605	And yet said Milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists   If he persists said the	153.1775360107422
564/3605	If he persists His Eminence made a pause and resumed If he persistswell then I shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of	257.7839050292969
565/3605	If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said Milady perhaps I should partake of your confidence as to the	271.9398193359375
566/3605	Well here for example said Richelieu when in 1610 for a cause similar to that which moves the duke King Henry	391.132568359375
567/3605	of glorious memory was about at the same time to invade Flanders and Italy in order to attack Austria on both	636.3501586914062
568/3605	Ay and observeit just occurs to me that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham and their preachers designate him as the Antich	2648.41650390625
569/3605	Well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the d	108.0765609741211
570/3605	The duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidel	516.371826171875
571/3605	No doubt said Milady coolly such a woman may be	360.7550964355469
572/3605	Well such a woman who would place the knife of Jacques Clément or of Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save	901.8894653320312
573/3605	Yes but she would then be the accomplice of an	47.919944763183594
574/3605	Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clément ever known   No for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they	621.488525390625
575/3605	The Palace of Justice would not be burned down for everybody monseign	306.470947265625
576/3605	You think then that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused by chance asked Richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no	121.73795318603516
577/3605	I think nothing I quote a fact that is	174.94308471679688
578/3605	Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier or the Queen Marie de Médicis I should use less precautions than I take being simply called Milady Clar	561.0326538085938
579/3605	What do you require then   I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should think proper to do for the greatest good of	75.2340087890625
580/3605	But in the first place this woman I have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the d	62.478370666503906
581/3605	Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of Gods	196.70205688476562
582/3605	Well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now	81.85717010498047
583/3605	Then if he persists notwithstanding all thisas that is as I have said the limit of my missionI shall have nothing to do but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of	167.9202880859375
584/3605	That is it is it not monseigneur and I shall have nothing else to do   That is it replied the cardinal dry	26.081106185913086
585/3605	Yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for I made them by serving your Emin	187.8324737548828
586/3605	In the first place there is a little _intrigante_ named Bonacie	212.37420654296875
587/3605	She is in the prison of N	274.6028747558594
588/3605	That is to say she was there replied Milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a	60.87771224975586
589/3605	And to which   I dont know the secret has been well	78.80126190185547
590/3605	But _I_ will know   And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is   I can see nothing inconvenient in that said the	118.23577880859375
591/3605	Well now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little Madame Bonacie	134.49069213867188
592/3605	Who is that   Her	71.13963317871094
593/3605	What is his name   Oh your Eminence knows him well cried Milady carried away by her	180.2944793701172
594/3605	He is the evil genius of both of	135.30787658691406
595/3605	Ah ah said the cardinal I know of whom you	48.32771682739258
596/3605	He is a bold fellow said the	29.978357315063477
597/3605	And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be	56.1519775390625
598/3605	I must have said the duke a proof of his connection with	98.23914337158203
599/3605	A proof cried Milady I will have	544.3949584960938
600/3605	Well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and I will send him to the Bast	120.50300598144531
601/3605	So far good monseigneur but afterwards   When once in the Bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low	98.4971694946289
602/3605	Ah _pardieu_ continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity   Monseigneur replied Milady a fair	66.26034545898438
603/3605	Life for life man for man give me one I will give you the	149.34869384765625
604/3605	An infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel   Give me paper a quill and some ink then said the	109.23286437988281
605/3605	There was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing	135.8824920654297
606/3605	Athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the	24.18738555908203
607/3605	Well said Porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation   Hush said Athos speaking in a low	12.607029914855957
608/3605	We have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides I dont prevent you from listening but I must be	141.36199951171875
609/3605	I will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire	120.31742858886719
610/3605	The rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about	814.0560913085938
611/3605	Be easy on that head replied Athos you know I am cool	131.24703979492188
612/3605	Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stove	128.85736083984375
613/3605	A CONJUGAL SCENE     As Athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came	1040.3717041015625
614/3605	He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were and found Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aram	88.84337615966797
615/3605	He cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was	37.95344924926758
616/3605	What has become of Monseigneur Athos asked	48.14904022216797
617/3605	Monseigneur replied Porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not	139.81671142578125
618/3605	And you what have you done Monsieur Porthos   I have won five pistoles of Aram	25.855730056762695

621/3605	The attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the brid	47.53989028930664
622/3605	At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the	57.814579010009766
623/3605	These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to Fort La Pointe and superintend her embark	377.5458679199219
624/3605	The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Ath	104.6571273803711
625/3605	The cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in	159.82058715820312
626/3605	Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two Musketeers and return to Ath	60.98538589477539

628/3605	My officer said Athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forget	101.41260528564453
629/3605	Go up said the host she is still in her	84.59456634521484
630/3605	Athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived Milady putting on her	225.5087127685547
631/3605	He entered the chamber and closed the door behind	16.683834075927734
632/3605	At the noise he made in pushing the bolt Milady turned	424.09332275390625
633/3605	Athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his	49.053775787353516
634/3605	On seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue Milady was	241.53704833984375
635/3605	Who are you and what do you want cried	59.579708099365234
636/3605	Humph murmured Athos it is certainly she   And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward Mil	179.2625274658203
637/3605	Do you know me madame said	22.77379608154297
638/3605	Milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a	78.38117218017578
639/3605	So far well said Athos I perceive you know	96.34169006347656
640/3605	The Comte de la Fère murmured Milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any	222.22308349609375
641/3605	Yes Milady replied Athos the Comte de la Fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a	61.05271911621094
642/3605	Sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal	85.94824981689453
643/3605	Milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a	86.16631317138672
644/3605	You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said Ath	446.00933837890625
645/3605	Your power is great I know but you also know that with the help of God men have often conquered the most terrible	250.75767517089844
646/3605	You have once before thrown yourself in my	491.78302001953125
647/3605	I thought I had crushed you madame but either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you   Milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed gro	93.4726333618164
648/3605	Yes hell has resuscitated you continued Ath	438.7270812988281
649/3605	Hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your	279.7374572753906
650/3605	Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed	560.5858154296875
651/3605	You believed me to be dead did you not as I believed you to be And the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fère as the name Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breu	279.2398376464844
652/3605	Was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us Our position is truly a strange one continued Athos	473.46929931640625
653/3605	We have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes dev	260.99652099609375
654/3605	But said Milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me   I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes I have not lost sight of	42.29690933227539
655/3605	You know what I have done   I can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this	61.38991928100586
656/3605	A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Mil	71.69892120361328
657/3605	Perhaps said Athos But at all events listen well to	79.03668212890625
658/3605	Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedI care very little about that I dont know	159.47344970703125
659/3605	Athos was seized with a kind of vert	82.0645751953125
660/3605	The sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembr	285.4577941894531
661/3605	He thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his	105.58027648925781
662/3605	His desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked	197.87986755371094
663/3605	Milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild	191.39031982421875
664/3605	Motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of	170.20310974121094
665/3605	With another man Milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew Ath	215.3651580810547
666/3605	You have one second to decide said	392.0219421386719
667/3605	Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward Ath	100.83425903320312
668/3605	Take it said she and be accursed   Athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read  	61.6058349609375
669/3605	3 1627     It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	129.7790985107422
670/3605	RICHELIEU     And now said Athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that I have drawn your teeth viper bite if you	586.9459838867188
671/3605	And he left the chamber without once looking behind	100.4354476928711
672/3605	At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they	104.08500671386719
673/3605	Gentlemen said he Monseigneurs order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to Fort La Pointe and never to leave her till she is on	546.975341796875
674/3605	As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of ass	292.26513671875
675/3605	With regard to Athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to	80.3377456665039
676/3605	In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the	123.68377685546875
677/3605	He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his	58.80443572998047
678/3605	He immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the	124.65585327148438
679/3605	Who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horse	49.89418411254883
680/3605	That is our brave Musketeer I think said the	104.59900665283203
681/3605	Yes monseigneur said Porthos it is	12.373801231384277
682/3605	Monsieur Athos said Richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have	88.5732192993164
683/3605	Gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the	789.7182006835938
684/3605	Saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendantfor that night he himself slept in the	126.28202819824219
685/3605	Well said Porthos and Aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required   I know it said Athos coolly since here it	61.53992462158203
686/3605	And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentin	73.3833236694336
687/3605	Only they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the Musket	53.83933639526367
688/3605	Milady as Athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following	187.36293029785156
689/3605	She had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of Ath	99.01577758789062
690/3605	She might say that Athos had hanged her but then Athos would tell that she was	219.98721313476562
691/3605	She thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her	256.5361022949219
692/3605	THE BASTION SAINTGERVAIS     On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends DArtagnan found them assembled in the same	987.8159790039062
693/3605	Athos was meditating Porthos was twisting his mustache Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours bound in blue	466.3981018066406
694/3605	I hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else I warn you I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bast	136.19085693359375
695/3605	Ah why were you not there gentlemen It was warm	704.8508911132812
696/3605	We were in a place where it was not very cold replied Porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to	62.00673294067383
697/3605	Oh oh said DArtagnan comprehending the slight frown of the Musket	47.80708694458008
698/3605	It appears there is something fresh	798.608154296875
699/3605	Aramis said Athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot I believe  	46.811302185058594
700/3605	How did you fare   For my part I ate but	93.3602066040039
701/3605	The day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but	295.6158142089844
702/3605	What said Athos no fish at a seaport   They say said Aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open	340.4058532714844
703/3605	But that is not quite what I mean to ask you Aramis replied Ath	26.109737396240234
704/3605	I want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted	114.08440399169922
705/3605	Why I think there were not many intr	1317.499267578125
706/3605	Yes Athos I know what you mean we shall do very well at the Parpaill	54.244956970214844
707/3605	Let us go to the Parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of	320.3282470703125
708/3605	DArtagnan who was accustomed to his friends manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took Athoss arm and went out without saying	119.30815887451172
709/3605	Athos made him a sign to come with	53.45290756225586
710/3605	Grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to	575.37939453125
711/3605	They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaill	312.7867431640625
712/3605	It was seven oclock in the morning and daylight began to	21.492525100708008
713/3605	The three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be	69.53109741210938
714/3605	Unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private	1778.6962890625
715/3605	The morning drum had just been beaten everyone shook off the drowsiness of night and to dispel the humid morning air came to take a drop at the	647.615478515625
716/3605	Dragoons Swiss Guardsmen Musketeers lighthorsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four	550.529541015625
717/3605	Thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their	921.2656860351562
718/3605	I see how it will be said Athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just	49.99174118041992
719/3605	DArtagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours	158.2682647705078
720/3605	Ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped	263.6127014160156
721/3605	I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the Rochella	182.31826782226562
722/3605	DArtagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their	109.50519561767578
723/3605	Well said Athos dont you hear Monsieur de Busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question Relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know	82.86406707763672
724/3605	Have you not taken a bastion said a Swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer	496.21923828125
725/3605	Yes monsieur said DArtagnan bowing we have had that	10.74687671661377
726/3605	We even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty	402.39996337890625
727/3605	Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly	210.70501708984375
728/3605	And what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be	394.7862243652344
729/3605	Gervais replied DArtagnan from behind which the Rochellais annoyed our work	190.71527099609375
730/3605	Was that affair hot   Yes moderately	1477.2315673828125
731/3605	We lost five men and the Rochellais eight or	198.8118438720703
732/3605	_Balzempleu_ said the Swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the German language had acquired a habit of swearing in	921.6286010742188
733/3605	But it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bast	322.19329833984375
734/3605	Gentlemen said Athos a wager   Ah _wooi_ a vager cried the	262.2887878417969
735/3605	Stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit I am in	423.0137939453125
736/3605	You cursed host a dripping pan immediately that I may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable	504.0821228027344
737/3605	You was right said the Swiss goose grease is kood with bas	10190.4189453125
738/3605	Now for the wager We listen Monsieur Ath	170.3499755859375
739/3605	Well Monsieur de Busigny I will bet you said Athos that my three companions Messieurs Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion	87.95855712890625
740/3605	Gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge	472.199951171875
741/3605	Porthos and Aramis looked at each other they began to	11.798048973083496
742/3605	But said DArtagnan in the ear of Athos you are going to get us all killed without	24.626489639282227
743/3605	We are much more likely to be killed said Athos if we do not	26.32105827331543
744/3605	My faith gentlemen said Porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache thats a fair bet I	299.8984680175781
745/3605	de Busigny so let us fix the	1371.5283203125
746/3605	You are four gentlemen said Athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for	128.31973266601562
747/3605	Will that do   Capitally replied	1529.8118896484375
748/3605	The fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the	781.7409057617188
749/3605	The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the	157.6092987060547
750/3605	Athos called Grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the nap	144.61752319335938
751/3605	Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his	446.93157958984375
752/3605	But where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the	60.440608978271484
753/3605	What matter if you are paid for it said Athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the	55.124298095703125
754/3605	Shall I give you the change my officer said the	83.28265380859375
755/3605	No only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the nap	361.4081726074219
756/3605	The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two bottles of	326.80023193359375
757/3605	Thirtyfive minutes after seven said Athos by which you perceive I am five minutes faster than	275.20782470703125
758/3605	And bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion	74.24264526367188
759/3605	Gervais followed by Grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which Athos had taught him not even thinking of	141.07701110839844
760/3605	As long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exchange one word besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of	65.22268676757812
761/3605	But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain DArtagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an	83.06515502929688
762/3605	And now my dear Athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going   Why you see plainly enough we are going to the bast	20.809932708740234
763/3605	But what are we going to do there   You know well that we go to breakfast	27.515243530273438
764/3605	Here at least said Athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb	44.79255676269531
765/3605	It appears to me said DArtagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seash	146.38133239746094
766/3605	Where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a	62.65018081665039
767/3605	Yes said Aramis Athos is right _Animadvertuntur in desertis	1890.0205078125
768/3605	A desert would not have been amiss said Porthos but it behooved us to find	400.80535888671875
769/3605	There is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and I believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the	534.4603881835938
770/3605	Better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we cannot retreat without	863.4403076171875
771/3605	We have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which I defy anyone to divine the true	115.29425048828125
772/3605	We are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bast	117.07006072998047
773/3605	Either we shall be attacked or	110.11090087890625
774/3605	If we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor I guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the	116.71517944335938
775/3605	Moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with	902.62646484375
776/3605	You see that everything is to our	245.16763305664062
777/3605	Yes said DArtagnan but we shall indubitably attract a	289.05389404296875
778/3605	Well my dear replied Athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the	121.71758270263672
779/3605	But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our musk	142.44483947753906
780/3605	Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden   I dont find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an	342.28924560546875
781/3605	Well replied Athos have you not heard what DArtagnan said   What did he say demanded Porth	14.4173002243042
782/3605	DArtagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten Frenchmen were killed and as many Rochella	90.57315826416016
783/3605	What then   The bodies were not plundered were they It appears the conquerors had something else to	174.86585998535156
784/3605	Well   Well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to	155.23631286621094
785/3605	Oh Athos said Aramis truly you are a great	27.987781524658203
786/3605	Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastionsomething he had till then doubtedhe pulled his master by the skirt of his	311.63177490234375
787/3605	Where are we going asked he by a	106.26353454589844
788/3605	But said Grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins	224.64593505859375
789/3605	Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward	62.09881591796875
790/3605	Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the	98.47856903076172
791/3605	Athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to Grimauds	123.05245208740234
792/3605	Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a	212.45127868652344
793/3605	Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on	106.96070098876953
794/3605	All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the v	330.5552062988281
795/3605	Arrived at the bastion the four friends turned	152.08714294433594
796/3605	More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished	185.24569702148438
797/3605	de Busigny the dragoon the Swiss and the fourth bet	2547.950927734375
798/3605	Athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the	35.17855453491211
799/3605	All the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither Grimaud had preceded	246.45826721191406
800/3605	THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS     As Athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses French and Rochella	2942.471923828125
801/3605	Gentlemen said Athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while Grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges	331.298095703125
802/3605	We can talk while performing that necessary	2877.221923828125
803/3605	These gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies cannot hear	471.00469970703125
804/3605	But we could throw them into the ditch said Porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their	110.2215805053711
805/3605	Well then cried DArtagnan pray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the	48.06068420410156
806/3605	Heaven forfend said Athos they may serve	586.8197631835938
807/3605	Judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied Ath	173.2315673828125
808/3605	How many guns gentlemen   Twelve replied Aram	402.0167541503906
809/3605	How many shots   A	300.205078125
810/3605	Thats quite as many as we shall	660.7987060546875
811/3605	The four Musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was	116.07640838623047
812/3605	Athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to Grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sent	626.5774536132812
813/3605	Only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty Athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of	161.2183837890625
814/3605	The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks or even tail	474.2113342285156
815/3605	And now said DArtagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard I hope you are going to let me into your	31.59295082092285
816/3605	I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said Ath	111.13359069824219
817/3605	I have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmentwo classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each	349.8125915527344
818/3605	The secret is said Athos that I saw Milady last	109.72838592529297
819/3605	DArtagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of Milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the	79.56532287597656
820/3605	You saw your wi   Hush interrupted Ath	219.3810272216797
821/3605	You forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like	149.3896484375
822/3605	Within two leagues of this place at the inn of the Red Dove	676.114990234375
823/3605	In that case I am lost said DArtagn	18.136756896972656
824/3605	Not so bad yet replied Athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of	94.71919250488281
825/3605	But after all asked Porthos who is Milady   A charming woman said Athos sipping a glass of sparkling	86.14836120605469
826/3605	What by demanding my head of the cardinal cried DArtagnan pale with	64.38371276855469
827/3605	Yes that is true as the Gospel said Porthos I heard her with my own	62.491363525390625
828/3605	Then said DArtagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle	124.0912094116211
829/3605	I may as well blow my brains out and all will be	87.7818603515625
830/3605	Thats the last folly to be committed said Athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no	161.48867797851562
831/3605	But I can never escape said DArtagnan with such	49.51198196411133
832/3605	First my stranger of Meung then De Wardes to whom I have given three sword wounds next Milady whose secret I have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance I have balk	1444.3890380859375
833/3605	Well said Athos that only makes four and we are fourone for	111.62389373779297
834/3605	_Pardieu_ if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of	105.70232391357422
835/3605	What is it Grimaud Considering the gravity of the occasion I permit you to speak my friend but be laconic I	204.0347442626953
836/3605	What do you see   A	49.67885208129883
837/3605	Of how many persons   Twenty	75.92926025390625
838/3605	What sort of men   Sixteen pioneers four	357.3182373046875
839/3605	How far distant   Five hundred p	110.38452911376953
840/3605	Good We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health DArtagn	97.39049530029297
841/3605	To your health repeated Porthos and Aram	33.122779846191406
842/3605	Well then to my health although I am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to	50.16469955444336
843/3605	Bah said Athos God is great as say the followers of Mohammed and the future is in his	251.52816772460938
844/3605	Then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him Athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the	104.7610855102539
845/3605	Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan followed his	13.674236297607422
846/3605	As to Grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their	132.43862915039062
847/3605	_Pardieu_ said Athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovel	521.6575927734375
848/3605	Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and I am convinced they would have left us in	82.50614929199219
849/3605	I doubt that replied DArtagnan for they are advancing very res	93.53433990478516
850/3605	Besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with musk	83.16629791259766
851/3605	Thats because they dont see us said Ath	142.51699829101562
852/3605	My faith said Aramis I must confess I feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of	92.90771484375
853/3605	He is a bad priest said Porthos who has pity for here	134.08375549316406
854/3605	In truth said Athos Aramis is	101.26836395263672
855/3605	What the devil are you going to do cried DArtagnan you will be	13.067035675048828
856/3605	Now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at	78.60746765136719
857/3605	Take care Athos cried DArtagnan dont you see they are aiming   Yes yes said Athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit	62.72807693481445
858/3605	In fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos but not one touched	82.28137969970703
859/3605	Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was	568.5848999023438
860/3605	Grimaud said Athos still on the breach another musket   Grimaud immediately ob	218.374267578125
861/3605	On their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the	462.71978759765625
862/3605	The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to	318.00445556640625
863/3605	Reload the muskets Grimaud said Athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our	80.2649917602539
864/3605	Where were we   I recollect you were saying said DArtagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal Milady had quit the shores of	68.46509552001953
865/3605	Whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route Milady	1098.08154296875
866/3605	With what view   With the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the Duke of	727.9628295898438
867/3605	DArtagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and	15.949371337890625
868/3605	As to that said Athos I beg you to believe that I care very little about	24.51412010192871
869/3605	Now you have done Grimaud take our brigadiers halfpike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the	254.61581420898438
870/3605	An instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four	298.5360412597656
871/3605	A thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the	954.9714965820312
872/3605	How replied DArtagnan you care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed But the duke is our	173.195556640625
873/3605	The duke is English the duke fights against	397.6708984375
874/3605	Let her do what she likes with the duke I care no more about him than an empty	148.97415161132812
875/3605	And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his	95.09209442138672
876/3605	He gave us some very fine	183.2609100341797
877/3605	And moreover very handsome saddles said Porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his	101.4313735961914
878/3605	Besides said Aramis God desires the conversion and not the death of a s	301.9633483886719
879/3605	But this creature must be a demon said Porthos holding out his plate to Aramis who was cutting up a f	69.34223937988281
880/3605	And this _carte blanche_ said DArtagnan this _carte blanche_ does it remain in her hands   No it passed into mine I will not say without trouble for if I did I should tell a	227.68319702148438
881/3605	My dear Athos I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my	55.85454559326172
882/3605	Then it was to go to her that you left us said Aram	55.94882583618164
883/3605	And you have that letter of the cardinal said DArtagn	23.97538948059082
884/3605	Here it is said Athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his	61.0433464050293
885/3605	DArtagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read  	84.6921157836914
886/3605	3 1627     It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	129.7790985107422
887/3605	RICHELIEU     In fact said Aramis it is an absolution according to	1166.6593017578125
888/3605	That paper must be torn to pieces said DArtagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of	83.9078369140625
889/3605	On the contrary said Athos it must be preserved	93.82523345947266
890/3605	I would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold	93.51525115966797
891/3605	And what will she do now asked the young	42.68899154663086
892/3605	The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest DArtagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the Bast	83.81046295166016
893/3605	Go to It appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said Porth	177.6976776123047
894/3605	I say I am entirely of Porthoss opinion replied Aram	57.2789421081543
895/3605	Fortunately she is far off said Porthos for I confess she would worry me if she were	60.87266159057617
896/3605	She worries me in England as well as in France said Ath	122.64959716796875
897/3605	But when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said Porth	103.29898834228516
898/3605	It is only the dead who do not	102.68148803710938
899/3605	You think so Porthos replied the Musketeer with a sad smile which DArtagnan alone	37.20025634765625
900/3605	The young men sprang up and seized their musk	53.17486572265625
901/3605	This time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the	278.49810791015625
902/3605	Shall we return to the camp said Porth	33.78667449951172
903/3605	I dont think the sides are	1360.890625
904/3605	The first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the	171.91331481933594
905/3605	Well then said Aramis we must form a plan of	34.20035171508789
906/3605	As soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon	495.7930603027344
907/3605	If they continue to advance we must fire	316.5782165527344
908/3605	We must fire as long as we have loaded	372.0235900878906
909/3605	If those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a	373.87841796875
910/3605	Decidedly Athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside	181.81117248535156
911/3605	Gentlemen said Athos no divided attention I beg let each one pick out his	1175.4681396484375
912/3605	The four muskets made but one report but four men	140.30953979492188
913/3605	The drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging	2876.334716796875
914/3605	Then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same	368.484130859375
915/3605	Nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the Rochellais continued to advance in quick	272.96356201171875
916/3605	With every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slack	561.7921142578125
917/3605	Arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the	46.888675689697266
918/3605	A last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the	297.51824951171875
919/3605	Now my friends said Athos finish them at a	109.97410583496094
920/3605	Then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over   Can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said Ath	120.66146850585938
921/3605	My faith it appears so said DArtagn	38.59917449951172
922/3605	No cried Porthos there go three or four limping	243.8845672607422
923/3605	In fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the	204.3396759033203
924/3605	These were all who were left of the little	117.55903625488281
925/3605	Gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair	268.099365234375
926/3605	Besides DArtagnan has not told us his idea	63.19420623779297
927/3605	And the Musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the	145.85911560058594
928/3605	Yes you said you had an idea said Ath	61.10773468017578
929/3605	Well I will go to England a second time I will go and find	50.3317985534668
930/3605	You shall not do that DArtagnan said Athos co	26.454879760742188
931/3605	And why not Have I not been there once   Yes but at that period we were not at	72.28907012939453
932/3605	At that period Buckingham was an ally and not an	407.2749938964844
933/3605	What you would now do amounts to	1136.174072265625
934/3605	DArtagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was	51.9834098815918
935/3605	But said Porthos I think I have an idea in my	16.620018005371094
936/3605	Silence for Monsieur Porthoss idea said Aram	84.75784301757812
937/3605	I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent I am not very clever at pretext	118.48332214355469
938/3605	Milady does not know me I will get access to her without her suspecting me and when I catch my beauty I will strangle	99.262451171875
939/3605	Well replied Athos I am not far from approving the idea of Monsieur Porth	34.28858184814453
940/3605	Kill a woman No listen to me I have the true	168.13380432128906
941/3605	Let us see your idea Aramis said Athos who felt much deference for the young Musket	147.40333557128906
942/3605	Ah my faith yes said Porthos and DArtagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it	25.45700454711914
943/3605	As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty said Aramis coloring I will take that upon	365.50115966796875
944/3605	I know a clever person at Tours   Aramis stopped on seeing Athos	224.52760314941406
945/3605	Well do you not adopt this means Athos said DArtagn	24.118499755859375
946/3605	Without reckoning objected Porthos that the queen would save Monsieur de Buckingham but would take no heed of	105.49980163574219
947/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan what Porthos says is full of	68.50794219970703
948/3605	Ah ah but whats going on in the city yonder said Ath	163.73104858398438
949/3605	The four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached	305.7624206542969
950/3605	You see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said Ath	67.97464752197266
951/3605	You dont think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said Porth	152.67584228515625
952/3605	I feel myself quite in a humor for it and I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of	114.76473236083984
953/3605	Upon my word the drum draws near said DArtagn	242.7419891357422
954/3605	It is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hours journey from the city to	124.28893280029297
955/3605	That is more than time enough for us to devise a	218.3252410888672
956/3605	If we go from this place we shall never find another so	157.79998779296875
957/3605	Ah stop I have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to	316.1197509765625
958/3605	Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable	642.3955688476562
959/3605	Athos made a sign for his lackey to	57.5864372253418
960/3605	Grimaud said Athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their	88.33486938476562
961/3605	And do you comprehend Grimaud said Aram	66.25165557861328
962/3605	Grimaud made a sign in the	109.70499420166016
963/3605	Thats all that is necessary said Athos now for my	122.76573944091797
964/3605	I should like however to comprehend said Porth	94.9521255493164
965/3605	Yes yes Athoss idea cried Aramis and DArtagnan at the same	29.077655792236328
966/3605	This Milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as I think you told me DArtagnan   Yes I know him very well and I also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sisterin	45.44356918334961
967/3605	If he detested her it would be all the better replied Ath	89.5196533203125
968/3605	In that case we are as well off as we	129.61279296875
969/3605	And yet said Porthos I would like to know what Grimaud is	30.948274612426758
970/3605	What is her brotherinlaws name   Lord de	39.22016906738281
971/3605	Where is he now   He returned to London at the first sound of	60.36431121826172
972/3605	Well theres just the man we want said Ath	161.33689880371094
973/3605	It is he whom we must	131.1508331298828
974/3605	We will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of	80.73751831054688
975/3605	There is in London I hope some establishment like that of the Magdalens or of the Repentant D	905.6499633789062
976/3605	He must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in	98.96305084228516
977/3605	Yes said DArtagnan till she comes	31.776260375976562
978/3605	Ah my faith said Athos you require too much DArtagn	42.84943771362305
979/3605	I have given you all I have and I beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my	44.697547912597656
980/3605	But I think it would be still better said Aramis to inform the queen and Lord de Winter at the same	30.09627914428711
981/3605	Yes but who is to carry the letter to Tours and who to London   I answer for Bazin said Aram	92.66645050048828
982/3605	Ay said Porthos if we cannot leave the camp our lackeys	39.59564208984375
983/3605	To be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said Aram	130.73455810546875
984/3605	Give the lackeys money and they will	337.246826171875
985/3605	We will give them money replied Ath	49.55537033081055
986/3605	Have you any money   The four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so	76.12592315673828
987/3605	Look out cried DArtagnan I see black points and red points moving y	322.71270751953125
988/3605	Why did you talk of a regiment Athos It is a veritable army   My faith yes said Athos there they	64.16158294677734
989/3605	See the sneaks come without drum or	15327.4345703125
990/3605	Ah ah have you finished Grimaud   Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque	52.13193893432617
991/3605	Some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in	947.4838256835938
992/3605	Bravo said Athos that does honor to your	441.685302734375
993/3605	All very well said Porthos but I should like to	15.518816947937012
994/3605	Let us decamp first and you will understand	1043.2698974609375
995/3605	A moment gentlemen a moment give Grimaud time to clear away the	730.3152465820312
996/3605	Ah ah said Aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarg	572.4989013671875
997/3605	I am of DArtagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our	49.45292663574219
998/3605	My faith said Athos I have nothing to say against a	47.35944747924805
999/3605	We bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a	273.21240234375
1000/3605	Nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off   Grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the	95.13526916503906
1001/3605	The four friends followed ten paces behind	132.42233276367188
1002/3605	What the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried Ath	52.695281982421875
1003/3605	The white flag _morbleu_ We must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a nap	236.5303192138672
1004/3605	And Athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures	381.2972412109375
1005/3605	But Athos might be said to bear a charmed	177.10166931152344
1006/3605	The balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck	228.9967498779297
1007/3605	Athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the	113.74425506591797
1008/3605	On both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries of	856.7556762695312
1009/3605	A second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a	785.116455078125
1010/3605	Cries were heard from the camp Come down come down   Athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with	141.62911987304688
1011/3605	Come along Athos come along cried DArtagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be	88.80077362060547
1012/3605	But Athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by	1118.5743408203125
1013/3605	Grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the	449.1091613769531
1014/3605	At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusill	65.04856872558594
1015/3605	Whats that asked Porthos what are they firing at now I hear no balls whistle and I see nobody   They are firing at the corpses replied Ath	268.7203674316406
1016/3605	But the dead cannot return their	1319.28662109375
1017/3605	Certainly not They will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their	121.59912872314453
1018/3605	That renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much	2363.80810546875
1019/3605	Oh I comprehend now said the astonished Porth	118.314453125
1020/3605	Thats lucky said Athos shrugging his	53.008148193359375
1021/3605	On their part the French on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of	308.036376953125
1022/3605	At length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their	187.31736755371094
1023/3605	The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the bast	98.3836669921875
1024/3605	These Rochellais are bungling fellows said Athos how many have we killed of thema dozen   Or	618.067138671875
1025/3605	How many did we crush under the wall   Eight or	306.84161376953125
1026/3605	And in exchange for all that not even a scratch Ah but what is the matter with your hand DArtagnan It bleeds	128.94580078125
1027/3605	A spent ball   Not even	674.5866088867188
1028/3605	What is it then   We have said that Athos loved DArtagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young	85.00806427001953
1029/3605	Only grazed a little replied DArtagnan my fingers were caught between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin was	446.976806640625
1030/3605	That comes of wearing diamonds my master said Athos disdain	312.92694091796875
1031/3605	Ah to be sure cried Porthos there is a	29.281131744384766
1032/3605	Why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond   Stop a bit said Aram	150.6984405517578
1033/3605	Well thought of Porthos this time you have an	42.68907165527344
1034/3605	Undoubtedly said Porthos drawing himself up at Athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell	107.2591323852539
1035/3605	But said DArtagnan it is the queens	17.45764923095703
1036/3605	The stronger reason why it should be sold replied Ath	139.603271484375
1037/3605	The queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham her lover nothing more	177.33135986328125
1038/3605	The queen saving us her friends nothing more	2033.027587890625
1039/3605	What says Monsieur the Abbé I dont ask Porthos his opinion has been	47.471683502197266
1040/3605	Why I think said Aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token DArtagnan may sell	210.2287139892578
1041/3605	My dear Aramis you speak like theology person	1747.0125732421875
1042/3605	Your advice then is   To sell the diamond replied Aram	101.06647491455078
1043/3605	Well then said DArtagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about	28.5699520111084
1044/3605	The fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consci	305.39434814453125
1045/3605	My faith it was time that idea came into Porthoss	168.56874084472656
1046/3605	Here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this	136.25198364257812
1047/3605	We are observed they are coming to meet	93.50370025634766
1048/3605	In fact as we have said the whole camp was in	188.43728637695312
1049/3605	More than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friendsan undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real	416.1524658203125
1050/3605	Nothing was heard but cries of Live the Musketeers Live the Guards	1983.793701171875
1051/3605	de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was	118.22021484375
1052/3605	The dragoon and the Swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the	111.90293884277344
1053/3605	There was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochella	510.57476806640625
1054/3605	The tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent La Houdinière his captain of the Guards to inquire what was going	298.598388671875
1055/3605	The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of	742.6778564453125
1056/3605	Well asked the cardinal on seeing La Houdinière	1009.5492553710938
1057/3605	Well monseigneur replied the latter three Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion	127.97199249267578
1058/3605	Gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed I dont know how many Rochella	202.91082763671875
1059/3605	Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers   Yes monseign	36.30692672729492
1060/3605	What are their names   Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aram	31.675485610961914
1061/3605	Still my three brave fellows murmured the	248.51422119140625
1062/3605	Positively these four men must be on my	229.95648193359375
1063/3605	The same evening the cardinal spoke to	175.0998992919922
1064/3605	de Tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole	112.43309020996094
1065/3605	de Tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his Eminence not forgetting the episode of the nap	139.63848876953125
1066/3605	Thats well Monsieur de Tréville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to	78.87257385253906
1067/3605	I will have three _fleurdelis_ embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a	315.7073059082031
1068/3605	de Tréville that will be unjust to the Guards	413.627685546875
1069/3605	Monsieur dArtagnan is not with me he serves under Monsieur Dessess	200.14894104003906
1070/3605	Well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same	65.38382720947266
1071/3605	de Tréville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and DArtagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next	103.97235107421875
1072/3605	We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musket	63.71887969970703
1073/3605	The three friends were likewise greatly	622.2156372070312
1074/3605	My faith said DArtagnan to Athos you had a triumphant idea As you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest	116.86727142333984
1075/3605	Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of God we shall henceforth pass for cardinal	311.7066650390625
1076/3605	That evening DArtagnan went to present his respects to	56.62849426269531
1077/3605	Dessessart and inform him of his	854.2461547851562
1078/3605	Dessessart who esteemed DArtagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for	1843.958740234375
1079/3605	DArtagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into	119.21261596679688
1080/3605	Dessessarts valet came to DArtagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand liv	210.5462188720703
1081/3605	This was the price of the queens	78.22065734863281
1082/3605	A FAMILY AFFAIR     Athos had invented the phrase family	9917.7626953125
1083/3605	A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family affair concerned	530.563720703125
1084/3605	People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the	247.63674926757812
1085/3605	Therefore Athos had invented the phrase _family affair	1128.8719482421875
1086/3605	Aramis had discovered the idea _the lackeys	154.32666015625
1087/3605	Porthos had discovered the means _the diamond	342.4707946777344
1088/3605	DArtagnan alone had discovered nothinghe ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed	212.84317016601562
1089/3605	Ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his	401.88433837890625
1090/3605	de Trévilles was as gay and cheerful as	645.7486572265625
1091/3605	DArtagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as Aramis and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete	364.7784423828125
1092/3605	DArtagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the	71.31777954101562
1093/3605	After breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at Athoss lodging and there finish their	120.79075622558594
1094/3605	DArtagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeers uniform in every street of the	161.81356811523438
1095/3605	In the evening at the appointed hour the four friends	32.182525634765625
1096/3605	There only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to Miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at Tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the	320.7718200683594
1097/3605	Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his	204.90032958984375
1098/3605	Porthos boasted of the strength of Mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary	229.19873046875
1099/3605	Aramis confiding in the address of Bazin made a pompous eulogium on his	256.37896728515625
1100/3605	Finally DArtagnan had entire faith in the bravery of Planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulog	102.02626037597656
1101/3605	These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too	469.8060302734375
1102/3605	Unfortunately said Athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities	1275.093017578125
1103/3605	But where is such a lackey to be found   Not to be found cried Ath	56.971221923828125
1104/3605	I know it well so take Grim	179.59156799316406
1105/3605	Planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the	111.08860778808594
1106/3605	Gentlemen said Aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the	285.4306945800781
1107/3605	What Aramis says is very sensible replied Athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their	224.63040161132812
1108/3605	Monsieur Abbé you are a great moral	65.89949798583984
1109/3605	Doubtless said Aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys   Speak lower Aramis said Ath	139.99771118164062
1110/3605	Thats wisenot for the lackeys resumed Aramis but for the masterfor the _masters_ we may	655.4780883789062
1111/3605	Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us	110.92742919921875
1112/3605	Well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him	204.068603515625
1113/3605	Why good God you will be deceived just the same said Athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in	335.0304260253906
1114/3605	They will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from	167.70103454589844
1115/3605	Once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess	1142.3502197265625
1116/3605	What the devil we are not	119.423583984375
1117/3605	To reach EnglandAthos lowered his voiceall France covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be	1774.4613037109375

1119/3605	Really I think the thing very	73.93828582763672
1120/3605	Not at all cried DArtagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary I think it very	41.69376754760742
1121/3605	It would be no doubt _parbleu_ if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal   Speak lower said Ath	102.07819366455078
1122/3605	of intrigues and secrets of state continued DArtagnan complying with the	190.07022094726562
1123/3605	I will write to him then nearly in these	260.57220458984375
1124/3605	Let us see said Athos assuming in advance a critical	466.8878479003906
1125/3605	_Monsieur and dear friend_   Ah yes _Dear friend_ to an Englishman interrupted Athos well commenced Bravo DArtagnan Only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the	258.170166015625
1126/3605	I will say then _Monsieur_ quite	110.22095489501953
1127/3605	You may even say _My Lord_ replied Athos who stickled for propri	1071.224609375
1128/3605	_My Lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg_   Good _the Luxembourg_ One might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother Thats ingenious said Ath	455.54449462890625
1129/3605	Well then we will put simply _My Lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared_   My dear DArtagnan you will never make anything but a very bad	184.97056579589844
1130/3605	_Where your life was spared_ For shame thats	13305.1044921875
1131/3605	A man of spirit is not to be reminded of such	369.2397155761719
1132/3605	A benefit reproached is an offense	40828.0859375
1133/3605	The devil said DArtagnan you are insupport	20.658262252807617
1134/3605	If the letter must be written under your censure my faith I renounce the	344.5556640625
1135/3605	Handle the musket and the sword my dear	95.99689483642578
1136/3605	You will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to Monsieur Abb	208.10182189941406
1137/3605	Ay ay said Porthos pass the pen to Aramis who writes theses in	731.7828369140625
1138/3605	Draw up this note for us Aramis but by our Holy Father the Pope cut it short for I shall prune you in my turn I warn	179.17620849609375
1139/3605	I ask no better said Aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the	150.67437744140625
1140/3605	I have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a h	433.62298583984375
1141/3605	I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the	118.82833862304688
1142/3605	But continued Aramis the details escape	1166.04150390625
1143/3605	DArtagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in	11.762603759765625
1144/3605	At length Athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to DArtagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to	68.54196166992188
1145/3605	Because she had been branded continued DArtagn	152.2698516845703
1146/3605	Impossible What do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed  	108.9046859741211
1147/3605	And her husband found out that she had a _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder cried Porth	201.3018035888672
1148/3605	These three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos each with a sadder inton	182.1731414794922
1149/3605	And who has seen this _fleurdelis_ inquired Aram	470.6939697265625
1150/3605	Or rather to observe the chronological order I and DArtagnan replied Ath	247.79443359375
1151/3605	And does the husband of this frightful creature still live said Aram	166.35813903808594
1152/3605	Are you quite sure of it   I am	15.825942993164062
1153/3605	There was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his	147.36953735351562
1154/3605	This time said Athos first breaking the silence DArtagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at	116.59886169433594
1155/3605	The devil You are right Athos said Aramis and it is a rather difficult	34.7493896484375
1156/3605	The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very	572.9224853515625
1157/3605	Never mind Be silent I will	618.29296875
1158/3605	As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important	289.0431213378906
1159/3605	Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in	246.5198516845703
1160/3605	But the third time which is the present you may	264.9659423828125
1161/3605	Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the	390.4630432128906
1162/3605	Watch her arrival for she has great and terrible	301.1904296875
1163/3605	If you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left	333.86004638671875
1164/3605	Well now that will do wonderfully well said Ath	524.4652099609375
1165/3605	My dear Aramis you have the pen of a secretary of	85.44718170166016
1166/3605	Lord de Winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be	71.51641845703125
1167/3605	I have the price and DArtagnan threw the bag upon the	35.677860260009766
1168/3605	At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes and Porthos	39.92331314086914
1169/3605	How much in that little bag   Seven thousand livres in louis of twelve franc	125.4418716430664
1170/3605	That poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres   It appears so said Athos since here they	78.2599868774414
1171/3605	I dont suppose that our friend DArtagnan has added any of his own to the	50.47235870361328
1172/3605	But gentlemen in all this said DArtagnan we do not think of the	20.442054748535156
1173/3605	Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear	691.5125732421875
1174/3605	That is the least we owe	209.5658416748047
1175/3605	Thats true said Athos but that concerns Aram	172.37510681152344
1176/3605	Well replied the latter blushing what must I say   Oh thats simple enough replied Ath	44.94613265991211
1177/3605	Write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at	400.59881591796875
1178/3605	Aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his	69.09819030761719
1179/3605	This clever person is your relative then   Cousing	3766.735595703125
1180/3605	It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even arrive in sight of the	159.66177368164062
1181/3605	I will even venture to say that I am certain	45.1566162109375
1182/3605	de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great	310.4450988769531
1183/3605	His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to	1023.4747924804688
1184/3605	He would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded	105.44599151611328
1185/3605	Give these happy tidings to your sister my dear	309.1094970703125
1186/3605	I have dreamed that the unlucky Englishman was	115.70582580566406
1187/3605	I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this I am sure I have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive	106.17662048339844
1188/3605	Be assured then of seeing me soon	653.4910888671875
1189/3605	Capital cried Athos you are the king of poets my dear Aram	63.31023406982422
1190/3605	You speak like the Apocalypse and you are as true as the	318.42767333984375
1191/3605	There is nothing now to do but to put the address to this	76.6641845703125
1192/3605	He folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote   _To Ml	215.2267608642578
1193/3605	The three friends looked at one another and laughed they were	115.33219909667969
1194/3605	Now said Aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that Bazin alone can carry this letter to	103.40573120117188
1195/3605	My cousin knows nobody but Bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would	1920.1383056640625
1196/3605	Besides Bazin is ambitious and learned Bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept	2827.75927734375
1197/3605	Well as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn or at least a	127.26748657226562
1198/3605	You can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than	271.19110107421875
1199/3605	Very well said DArtagnan I consent to Bazin with all my heart but grant me Planc	44.53968048095703
1200/3605	Milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his	554.0825805664062
1201/3605	Now Planchet has an excellent memory and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to	123.53229522705078
1202/3605	If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements Aramis those of London are	1493.3104248046875
1203/3605	I request then that Planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to London with me and knows how to speak correctly _London sir if you please and my master Lord DArtagnan	180.76156616210938
1204/3605	With that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and	155.22129821777344
1205/3605	In that case said Athos Planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and Bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand liv	114.62384796142578
1206/3605	We will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common	220.70736694335938
1207/3605	Will that do   My dear Athos said Aramis you speak like Nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the	102.82681274414062
1208/3605	Well then said Athos it is	20.28321075439453
1209/3605	Everything considered I am not sorry to retain Grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and I am	85.87537384033203
1210/3605	Yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him	517.699951171875
1211/3605	Planchet was sent for and instructions were given	127.50930786132812
1212/3605	The matter had been named to him by DArtagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the	71.57451629638672
1213/3605	I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said Planchet and if I am taken I will swallow	75.18749237060547
1214/3605	Well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said DArtagn	18.124160766601562
1215/3605	You will give me a copy this evening which I shall know by heart	141.9122314453125
1216/3605	DArtagnan looked at his friends as if to say Well what did I tell you   Now continued he addressing Planchet you have eight days to get an interview with Lord de Winter you have eight days to returnin all sixteen	44.45131301879883
1217/3605	If on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past	82.53357696533203
1218/3605	Then monsieur said Planchet you must buy me a	18.13079833984375
1219/3605	Take this said Athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good	175.16612243652344
1220/3605	Remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your masters head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for	265.170166015625
1221/3605	But remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to DArtagnan I will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your	183.08648681640625
1222/3605	Oh monsieur said Planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the Musket	93.83502960205078
1223/3605	And I said Porthos rolling his large eyes remember I will skin you	379.5738525390625
1224/3605	Ah monsieur   And I said Aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that I will roast you at a slow fire like a	93.70674896240234
1225/3605	Ah monsieur   Planchet began to	14.530064582824707
1226/3605	We will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely	360.4665832519531
1227/3605	See Planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like	213.05763244628906
1228/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet I will succeed or I will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will	74.0180435180664
1229/3605	It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by	42.460601806640625
1230/3605	He gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight oclock in the	97.17168426513672
1231/3605	In the morning as he was mounting his horse DArtagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took Planchet	60.79816436767578
1232/3605	When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it you will further say to him _Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham for they wish to assassinate him	299.70733642578125
1233/3605	But this Planchet is so serious and important that I have not informed my friends that I would entrust this secret to you and for a captains commission I would not write	156.34988403320312
1234/3605	Be satisfied monsieur said Planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in	47.10371780395508
1235/3605	Bazin set out the next day for Tours and was allowed eight days for performing his	264.01739501953125
1236/3605	The four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the h	201.7574005126953
1237/3605	Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who	154.72048950195312
1238/3605	More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected	1077.41748046875
1239/3605	They had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety Milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very	340.6354675292969
1240/3605	The four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was	257.93316650390625
1241/3605	It is true however that it was the shorter and easier	286.90594482421875
1242/3605	Aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orth	104.14781188964844
1243/3605	Good God cried he laughing I quite despair of my poor Michon she will never write like Monsieur de Vo	154.82691955566406
1244/3605	What does you mean by boor Michon said the Swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter	140.29722595214844
1245/3605	Oh _pardieu_ less than nothing said Aramis a charming little seamstress whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few lines as a sort of keeps	397.7513427734375
1246/3605	The duvil said the Swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade   Aramis read the letter and passed it to Ath	128.79457092285156
1247/3605	See what she writes to me Athos said	213.6763153076172
1248/3605	Adieu Take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken	151.32308959960938
1249/3605	MARIE MICHON     And what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the	1173.948486328125
1250/3605	Yez whats the dream said the	3311.81396484375
1251/3605	Well _pardieu_ said Aramis it was only this I had a dream and I related it to	36.468894958496094
1252/3605	Yez yez said the Swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but I neffer	11103.205078125
1253/3605	You are very fortunate said Athos rising I wish I could say as much   Neffer replied the Swiss enchanted that a man like Athos could envy him	169.3052520751953
1254/3605	Neffer neffer   DArtagnan seeing Athos rise did likewise took his arm and went	174.1383514404297
1255/3605	Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the	59.82433319091797
1256/3605	As to Bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the Swiss he dreamed that Aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals	77.35047149658203
1257/3605	But as we have said Bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four	106.5279541015625
1258/3605	The days of expectation are long and DArtagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour	380.84515380859375
1259/3605	He forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of Mil	1089.5341796875
1260/3605	He credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that Planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his	183.94947814941406
1261/3605	Still further his confidence in the worthy Picard at one time so great diminished day by	1485.750244140625
1262/3605	This anxiety became so great that it even extended to Aramis and Porth	106.21991729736328
1263/3605	Athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary	229.79249572753906
1264/3605	On the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in DArtagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was	101.18051147460938
1265/3605	Really said Athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so And what does it amount to after all To be	167.48878479003906
1266/3605	Well but we should be taken out of prison Madame Bonacieux was	139.0212860107422
1267/3605	Wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest Planchet will be	127.21749114990234
1268/3605	He promised to be here and I have very great faith in Planchet who appears to me to be a very good	43.05124282836914
1269/3605	But if he does not come said DArtagn	12.629968643188477
1270/3605	Well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed thats	57.47163009643555
1271/3605	He may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarr	379.55596923828125
1272/3605	Eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a	1497.18896484375
1273/3605	Be philosophers as I am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us	89.30796813964844
1274/3605	Nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambert	575.6024780273438
1275/3605	Thats all very well replied DArtagnan but I am tired of fearing when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of Mil	87.69593048095703
1276/3605	You are very fastidious said Athos such a beautiful woman   A woman of mark said Porthos with his loud	38.71030044555664

1278/3605	The day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it	318.25750732421875
1279/3605	Athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the Parpaill	181.90455627441406
1280/3605	de Busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his	472.839599609375
1281/3605	They were playing together as usual when seven oclock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the	233.1749267578125
1282/3605	At half past seven the retreat was	579.8915405273438
1283/3605	We are lost said DArtagnan in the ear of Ath	12.361557960510254
1284/3605	You mean to say we _have lost_ said Athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the	87.4258804321289
1285/3605	Come gentlemen said he they are beating the	285.4192810058594
1286/3605	Let us to bed   And Athos went out of the Parpaillot followed by DArtagn	22.43274688720703
1287/3605	Aramis came behind giving his arm to Porth	47.690433502197266
1288/3605	Aramis mumbled verses to himself and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of	194.64842224121094
1289/3605	But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to DArtagnan and a wellknown voice said Monsieur I have brought your cloak it is chilly this	65.83524322509766
1290/3605	Planchet cried DArtagnan beside himself with	14.84857177734375
1291/3605	Well yes Planchet to be sure said Athos what is there so astonishing in that He promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is	105.8683853149414
1292/3605	Bravo Planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master I will promise you a place in my	62.16773223876953
1293/3605	Oh no never said Planchet I will never leave Monsieur dArtagn	18.908374786376953
1294/3605	At the same time DArtagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his	26.263288497924805
1295/3605	DArtagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passersby and he restrained	91.74049377441406
1296/3605	I have the note said he to Athos and to his	41.088470458984375
1297/3605	Thats well said Athos let us go home and read	71.32818603515625
1298/3605	The note burned the hand of DArtagn	36.21512985229492
1299/3605	He wished to hasten their steps but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his	60.553802490234375
1300/3605	At length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised DArtagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected	85.81114196777344
1301/3605	It contained half a line in a hand perfectly British and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan   _Thank you be easy	1232.5887451171875
1302/3605	Athos took the letter from the hands of DArtagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a c	61.29874801635742
1303/3605	Then calling Planchet he said Now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as	135.1497039794922
1304/3605	I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said Planc	105.36833190917969
1305/3605	Well cried DArtagnan tell us all about	13.607945442199707
1306/3605	You are right Planchet said Athos besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the	230.533203125
1307/3605	Go to bed Planchet and sleep sound	144.62310791015625
1308/3605	My faith monsieur that will be the first time I have done so for sixteen	36.57971954345703
1309/3605	Well if you will have the truth and me too said Ath	46.30030822753906
1310/3605	But the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept	2755.05908203125
1311/3605	Nine days after leaving the Charente pale with fatigue and vexation Milady saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre	1334.6566162109375
1312/3605	She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three	103.6258316040039
1313/3605	Add another day for landing and that would make	261.831298828125
1314/3605	Add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in	692.3043823242188
1315/3605	She reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against	227.46791076660156
1316/3605	She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of	514.1416625976562
1317/3605	Milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France the messenger of his Eminence entered the port in	439.3501281738281
1318/3605	All the city was agitated by an extraordinary	382.0255432128906
1319/3605	Four large vessels recently built had just been	3382.04541015625
1320/3605	It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England remembers that there is a	246.3781280517578
1321/3605	They entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the	481.4997253417969
1322/3605	This boat contained an officer a mate and eight row	1178.4393310546875
1323/3605	The officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the	68.43643188476562
1324/3605	The officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon	233.04798889160156
1325/3605	When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without	864.8908081054688
1326/3605	Then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to Milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to	115.28903198242188
1327/3605	He then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed	144.56353759765625
1328/3605	Then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six	739.3963012695312
1329/3605	The boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous	239.29620361328125
1330/3605	During the examination of Milady by the officer as may well be imagined Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her	181.78871154785156
1331/3605	But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her	257.19921875
1332/3605	The officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twentyfive or twentysix years of	30.792404174804688
1333/3605	When they entered the port it was already	264.571533203125
1334/3605	The fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become	561.9359741210938
1335/3605	The air they breathed was heavy damp and	3010.6796875
1336/3605	Milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of	261.5925598144531
1337/3605	The officer desired to have Miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the	159.81021118164062
1338/3605	When this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his	276.71990966796875
1339/3605	Milady looked at this man and	314.6755676269531
1340/3605	Who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account   You may perceive madame by my uniform that I am an officer in the English navy replied the young	68.06153869628906
1341/3605	These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calm	69.712890625
1342/3605	Nevertheless they had not the power of convincing Mil	179.06961059570312
1343/3605	But I am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester my name is Lady Clarik and this measure   This measure is general madame and you will seek in vain to evade	427.8534240722656
1344/3605	Accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat	73.53678894042969
1345/3605	A large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside	250.77894592285156
1346/3605	The eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the	114.79833221435547
1347/3605	In five minutes they gained the	156.69508361816406
1348/3605	The officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to Mil	68.17853546142578
1349/3605	Is this carriage for us asked Mil	683.0128173828125
1350/3605	The hôtel then is far away   At the other end of the	108.53004455566406
1351/3605	Very well said Milady and she resolutely entered the	340.1884460449219
1352/3605	The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside Milady and shut the	165.12210083007812
1353/3605	Immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the	206.93862915039062
1354/3605	At the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being	47.74339294433594
1355/3605	Houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one	257.1121520996094
1356/3605	But we are no longer in the city sir said	54.51885223388672
1357/3605	I beg you to understand sir I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking	43.1370964050293
1358/3605	Oh this is too much cried Mil	176.02670288085938
1359/3605	Help help   No voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a	537.3085327148438
1360/3605	Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the	152.1510467529297
1361/3605	Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself	73.39942932128906
1362/3605	Take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in	110.50892639160156
1363/3605	The officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost	324.9342041015625
1364/3605	Then you dont know me sir   It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing	10.63584041595459
1365/3605	And on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me   None I swear to	26.50358772277832
1366/3605	There was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that Milady felt	191.54478454589844
1367/3605	At length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and	395.106201171875
1368/3605	Then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel Milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep	402.4970703125
1369/3605	The carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and	375.13934326171875
1370/3605	Almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to Milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calm	40.1847038269043
1371/3605	Still then I am a prisoner said Milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but I feel assured it will not be for long added	79.70140838623047
1372/3605	My own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of	251.4420623779297
1373/3605	However flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different mod	764.1785888671875
1374/3605	Immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach	669.6331787109375
1375/3605	Then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the	90.16035461425781
1376/3605	She with a stillsmiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of	169.16436767578125
1377/3605	They then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for Mil	108.87940216064453
1378/3605	With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest	199.06674194335938
1379/3605	It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the	353.0816345214844
1380/3605	In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate	237.87118530273438
1381/3605	But no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without	341.39715576171875
1382/3605	The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness Milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his	189.95932006835938
1383/3605	It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become	172.5670623779297
1384/3605	At length Milady could hold out no longer she broke the	579.8445434570312
1385/3605	In the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing Put an end to my doubts I have courage enough for any danger I can foresee for every misfortune which I	197.22621154785156
1386/3605	Where am I and why am I here If I am free why these bars and these doors If I am a prisoner what crime have I committed   You are here in the apartment destined for you mad	133.611083984375
1387/3605	I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this	44.490234375
1388/3605	This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a	69.18684387207031
1389/3605	There terminates at least to the present moment the duty I had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another	766.2752685546875
1390/3605	And who is that other person asked Milady warm	340.9964294433594
1391/3605	Can you not tell me his name   At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the	42.0234489440918
1392/3605	Some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the	176.49148559570312
1393/3605	That person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of	85.63823699951172
1394/3605	At the same time the door opened a man appeared on the	36.95151901245117
1395/3605	He was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his	124.51773071289062
1396/3605	Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a	119.93885040283203
1397/3605	The stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp Milady involuntarily drew	276.9794616699219
1398/3605	Then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor What my brother is it you   Yes fair lady replied Lord de Winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is I	82.70065307617188
1399/3605	But this castle then   Is	275.42523193359375
1400/3605	I am then your prisoner   Nearly	92.4064712524414
1401/3605	But this is a frightful abuse of power   No highsounding words Let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to	384.40655517578125
1402/3605	Then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he	48.05221176147461
1403/3605	All is well I thank you now leave us alone	557.7517700195312
1404/3605	She knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrig	329.7996520996094
1405/3605	She rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been	595.5860595703125
1406/3605	This supposition appeared to her most	434.7012023925781
1407/3605	It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the	127.41911315917969
1408/3605	At all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent	118.75294494628906
1409/3605	Yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future	131.8732452392578
1410/3605	You have then decided to come to England again said Lord de Winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to set your feet on British ground   Milady replied to this question by another	243.2130889892578
1411/3605	Ah to see me said de Winter cunning	491.0390625
1412/3605	What is there astonishing in that   And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me  	53.57088088989258
1413/3605	So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the Channel   For you	67.69966888427734
1414/3605	The deuce What tenderness my sister   But am I not your nearest relative demanded Milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuous	234.08876037597656
1415/3605	And my only heir are you not said Lord de Winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of Mil	47.05049133300781
1416/3605	Whatever command she had over herself Milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape	95.41757202148438
1417/3605	In fact the blow was direct and	617.2984008789062
1418/3605	The first idea that occurred to Miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her	159.70343017578125
1419/3605	She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon DArtagnan when he spared the life of her	110.09346771240234
1420/3605	I do not understand my Lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak	137.00059509277344
1421/3605	What do you mean to say Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words   Oh my God no said Lord de Winter with apparent good	77.05997467041016
1422/3605	You wish to see me and you come to	58.296756744384766
1423/3605	What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me   No what I think astonishing is that you should expect my	68.37674713134766
1424/3605	And yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear	34.07687759399414
1425/3605	Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers I am commandant of the	287.6397399902344
1426/3605	My heart told me what your mouth has just confirmedthat is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this momentand I sent my cutter to meet	236.20693969726562

1429/3605	Ah I can understand how the sight of him struck you replied Lord de	102.86741638183594
1430/3605	You came from a country where he must be very much talked of and I know that his armaments against France greatly engage the attention of your friend the	307.0112609863281
1431/3605	My friend the cardinal cried Milady seeing that on this point as on the other Lord de Winter seemed well	145.95590209960938
1432/3605	Is he not your friend replied the baron neglig	99.56436157226562
1433/3605	Ah pardon I thought so but we will return to my Lord Duke	472.3798828125
1434/3605	Let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had	1211.5191650390625
1435/3605	You came you say to see me  	93.29402160644531
1436/3605	Well I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every	35.608367919921875
1437/3605	Am I then to remain here eternally demanded Milady with a certain	252.07701110839844
1438/3605	Do you find yourself badly lodged sister Demand anything you want and I will hasten to have you furnished with	361.91448974609375
1439/3605	But I have neither my women nor my	116.5915756225586
1440/3605	Tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although I am only your brotherinlaw I will arrange one	158.82810974121094
1441/3605	My first husband cried Milady looking at Lord de Winter with eyes almost starting from their	230.5114288330078
1442/3605	If you have forgotten as he is still living I can write to him and he will send me information on the	43.89939880371094
1443/3605	A cold sweat burst from the brow of Mil	117.97936248779297
1444/3605	You jest said she in a hollow	141.640869140625
1445/3605	Do I look so asked the baron rising and going a step	187.70594787597656
1446/3605	Or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her	252.3839569091797
1447/3605	I insult you said Lord de Winter with	182.70919799804688
1448/3605	In truth madame do you think that can be possible   Indeed sir said Milady you must be either drunk or	58.445556640625
1449/3605	Leave the room and send me a	123.26262664794922
1450/3605	Cannot I serve you as a waiting maid By that means all our secrets will remain in the	481.46875
1451/3605	Insolent cried Milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his	154.69674682617188
1452/3605	I know you are accustomed to assassinate people but I warn you I shall defend myself even against	58.04680633544922
1453/3605	You have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a	225.30685424804688
1454/3605	Perhaps so and I have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you I	69.03340148925781
1455/3605	And the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of Milady which he almost touched with his	105.85738372802734
1456/3605	Milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a	277.011962890625
1457/3605	Oh growl as much as you please cried Lord de Winter but dont try to bite for I warn you that it would be to your	95.24234008789062
1458/3605	There are here no procurators who regulate successions	22673.552734375
1459/3605	And these judges I warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders	256.22998046875
1460/3605	The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole	278.27960205078125
1461/3605	Not a penny of what I possess will pass into your	193.11439514160156
1462/3605	I will be silent but you must endure your captivity	167.54214477539062
1463/3605	In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the	87.30652618408203
1464/3605	And be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the	64.74122619628906
1465/3605	Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed	460.71893310546875
1466/3605	Yes at present continued Lord de Winter you will remain in this	76.08143615722656
1467/3605	The walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window opens immediately over the	1560.28759765625
1468/3605	The men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the	222.4528350830078
1469/3605	Even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to	150.29498291015625
1470/3605	A step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired	392.020263671875
1471/3605	If they kill you English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it	277.4247741699219
1472/3605	Ah I see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its	1471.701171875
1473/3605	You are saying to yourself Fifteen days twenty days Bah I have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to	1543.1805419921875
1474/3605	Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from	99.86453247070312
1475/3605	Ah try it   Milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except	747.356201171875
1476/3605	Lord de Winter continued The officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know	203.9007110595703
1477/3605	He knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not I am sure come from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him	155.37908935546875
1478/3605	What do you say of him Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute You have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but I give you leave to try them upon this	243.56985473632812
1479/3605	_Pardieu_ if you succeed with him I pronounce you the demon	292.7784423828125
1480/3605	He went toward the door and opened it	34.63710403442383
1481/3605	Wait a minute longer and I will introduce him to	54.9395637512207
1482/3605	There followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard	170.4539031982422
1483/3605	Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the bar	66.26934814453125
1484/3605	Come in my dear John said Lord de Winter come in and shut the	117.44293975830078
1485/3605	Now said the baron look at this	86.32291412353516
1486/3605	She is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly sed	2382.92822265625
1487/3605	Well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribun	83.88082885742188
1488/3605	Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promisesI must do her that	2227.31982421875
1489/3605	She will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill	323.9539794921875
1490/3605	I have extricated you from misery Felton I have caused you to be named lieutenant I once saved your life you know on what	168.4373016357422
1491/3605	I am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a	48.0564079284668
1492/3605	This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my	104.67070770263672
1493/3605	I hold this serpent in my	244.0425567626953
1494/3605	Well I call you and say to you Friend Felton John my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this	736.8593139648438
1495/3605	Swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has mer	421.3272399902344
1496/3605	John Felton I trust your word John Felton I put faith in your loyalty   My Lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my Lord I swear all shall be done as you	286.31103515625
1497/3605	Milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful count	149.4634552001953
1498/3605	Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a	779.1165771484375
1499/3605	She is not to leave this chamber understand John continued the bar	202.3634490966797
1500/3605	She is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but youif you will do her the honor to address a word to	109.04920196533203
1501/3605	That is sufficient my Lord I have	365.2806091308594
1502/3605	And now madame try to make your peace with God for you are judged by men   Milady let her head sink as if crushed by this	217.69703674316406
1503/3605	Lord de Winter went out making a sign to Felton who followed him shutting the door after	107.6158447265625
1504/3605	One instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his	194.5054473876953
1505/3605	OFFICER     Meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England but no news arrived that was not annoying and	422.92303466796875
1506/3605	Although La Rochelle was invested however certain success might appearthanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged citythe blockade might last a long time	938.1646118164062
1507/3605	This was a great affront to the kings army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil Louis	152.81399536132812
1508/3605	with Anne of Austriafor that affair was overbut he had to adjust matters for	542.9232788085938
1509/3605	de Bassompierre who was embroiled with the Duc dAngoulê	1067.8072509765625
1510/3605	As to Monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing	150.7263946533203
1511/3605	The city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender the mayor had hanged the mutine	935.7980346679688
1512/3605	This execution quieted the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strang	533.7612915039062
1513/3605	On their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham or the spies which Buckingham sent to the Rochella	423.828857421875
1514/3605	In one case or the other the trial was soon	238.12051391601562
1515/3605	The cardinal pronounced the single word Hanged The king was invited to come and see the	381.6335754394531
1516/3605	He came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the	337.24298095703125
1517/3605	Nevertheless time passed on and the Rochellais did not	484.9911193847656
1518/3605	The last spy that was taken was the bearer of a	164.95753479003906
1519/3605	The Rochellais then had no hope but in	672.4707641601562
1520/3605	It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham their courage would fail with their	432.31634521484375
1521/3605	The cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not	131.13430786132812
1522/3605	The question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always	589.5602416992188
1523/3605	In the first place La Rochelle appeared impregn	104.3145980834961
1524/3605	Then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which Frenchman would combat against Frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of	489.7286682128906
1525/3605	In fact the sack of La Rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of	480.2708740234375
1526/3605	Bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good Catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsLa Rochelle is impregnable except to	905.1798095703125
1527/3605	The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a	284.6888122558594
1528/3605	And yet he reckoned and with reason on Mil	612.5850830078125
1529/3605	He resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate	385.5689392089844
1530/3605	He continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Roc	532.145263671875
1531/3605	Meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of Louis	693.4584350585938
1532/3605	his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of Robespierre he repeated this maxim of Tristans gossip Divide in order to	796.4465942382812
1533/3605	when besieging Paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the	7693.775390625
1534/3605	The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the Rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their	935.232421875
1535/3605	Up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it	508.6412048339844
1536/3605	These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal	319.7425537109375
1537/3605	Still further Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against France and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English Imperial and Spanish	379.03778076171875
1538/3605	This letter was read publicly in all parts of the	171.41610717773438
1539/3605	Copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously	311.4426574707031
1540/3605	This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieus former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the	139.4039764404297
1541/3605	During this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the	600.021484375
1542/3605	All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and ga	6276.30322265625
1543/3605	Four of these men were our Musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just	108.29792785644531
1544/3605	This letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drum	302.95648193359375
1545/3605	The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure wine these were the lackeys of these	1168.0604248046875
1546/3605	The cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in	269.273193359375
1547/3605	Besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of	472.9390563964844
1548/3605	It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this	102.45269775390625
1549/3605	You are speaking you scoundrel said Athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming	204.03025817871094
1550/3605	Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his	284.82080078125
1551/3605	With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet and saluted with	158.87559509277344
1552/3605	It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard said	524.2412109375
1553/3605	Lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentin	259.5096740722656
1554/3605	Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting	119.96047973632812
1555/3605	DArtagnan continued Athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to Monseigneur here it is avail yourself of	117.09848022460938
1556/3605	These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished Athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by	190.68016052246094
1557/3605	DArtagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the	58.950958251953125
1558/3605	It does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which Athos had started it does not signify	244.275390625
1559/3605	I do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody	210.39297485351562
1560/3605	Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of ass	163.67710876464844
1561/3605	Then he resumed in his turn Discipline Monseigneur has I hope in no way been forgotten by	268.390625
1562/3605	We are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we	65.5422134399414
1563/3605	If we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your Eminence we are ready to obey	78.51837921142578
1564/3605	Your Eminence may perceive continued Athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our	159.45558166503906
1565/3605	And he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and	124.93167114257812
1566/3605	Your Eminence may believe added DArtagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward us with so few	88.02980041503906
1567/3605	The cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a	167.27415466308594
1568/3605	Do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the	93.6874008178711
1569/3605	Oh as to that Monseigneur it is true said Athos we do conspire as your Eminence might have seen the other	90.66069793701172
1570/3605	Ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me	204.8357391357422
1571/3605	The color mounted to the face of Athos and he made a step toward his Emin	43.434913635253906
1572/3605	One might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrog	352.0038757324219
1573/3605	If it be so we trust your Eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real	141.6001434326172
1574/3605	And if it were an interrogatory replied the	86.53408813476562
1575/3605	Others besides you have undergone such Monsieur Athos and have replied	539.9818115234375
1576/3605	Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to	65.31761169433594
1577/3605	What was that letter you were about to read Monsieur Aramis and which you so promptly concealed   A womans letter monseign	55.80188751220703
1578/3605	Ah yes I see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know I have taken	83.322021484375
1579/3605	Monseigneur said Athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a womans letter but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme nor Madame dAigu	167.71878051757812
1580/3605	The cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his	197.21502685546875
1581/3605	He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdini	526.5734252929688
1582/3605	Athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be	81.48082733154297
1583/3605	The cardinalists were three the Musketeers lackeys included were	1214.341064453125
1584/3605	He judged that the match would be so much the less equal if Athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a	317.9656677246094
1585/3605	Well well said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in	484.4738464355469
1586/3605	We can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over	333.7664489746094
1587/3605	Gentlemen I have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red Dove	459.501953125
1588/3605	If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am going I would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your	123.78472137451172
1589/3605	Adieu gentlemen   And remounting his horse which Cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode	235.48866271972656
1590/3605	The four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had	55.780391693115234
1591/3605	The countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his Eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his	163.58792114257812
1592/3605	Athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful	79.25965881347656
1593/3605	When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight That Grimaud kept bad watch cried Porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on	179.45213317871094
1594/3605	Grimaud was about to reply to excuse	293.8105773925781
1595/3605	Athos lifted his finger and Grimaud was	82.95159149169922
1596/3605	Would you have given up the letter Aramis said DArtagn	28.509363174438477
1597/3605	I said Aramis in his most flutelike tone I had made up my	74.68655395507812
1598/3605	If he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him I would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other I would have run my sword through his	32.728519439697266
1599/3605	I expected as much said Athos and that was why I threw myself between you and	98.05101013183594
1600/3605	Indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and	127.8483657836914
1601/3605	My dear Athos I admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after	74.01309967041016
1602/3605	One might have supposed the Bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic Medusa had converted you into	596.8580322265625
1603/3605	Is being in love conspiring You are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the	77.94029998779297
1604/3605	Thats a match you are playing with his Eminence this letter is your	264.7801513671875
1605/3605	Why should you expose your game to your adversary That is never	225.63165283203125
1606/3605	Let him find it out if he can We can find out his   Well thats all very sensible Athos said DArtagn	56.340576171875
1607/3605	In that case let there be no more question of whats past and let Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted	248.77078247070312
1608/3605	Aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine	180.11497497558594
1609/3605	You had only read a line or two said DArtagnan read the letter again from the	103.84085083007812
1610/3605	Nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be I believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of	116.1776351928711
1611/3605	Meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her	238.65328979492188
1612/3605	I know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as I have given you proofs my dear cousin I am not unskilled in such affairs and I will take charge of the	268.9099426269531
1613/3605	My sister thanks you for your good and eternal	1296.586181640625
1614/3605	She has experienced much anxiety but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen	474.56671142578125
1615/3605	Tell us news of yourself as often as you     can that is to say as often as you can with	297.6451110839844
1616/3605	I embrace    	693.83544921875
1617/3605	MARIE MICHON     Oh what do I not owe you Aramis said DArtagn	367.0536804199219
1618/3605	Dear Constance I have at length then intelligence of	770.6512451171875
1619/3605	She lives she is in safety in a convent she is at Béthune Where is Béthune Athos   Why upon the frontiers of Artois and of F	403.7779235839844
1620/3605	The siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that	109.75590515136719
1621/3605	And that will not be long it is to be hoped said Porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were reduced to the leather of their	210.0725860595703
1622/3605	Supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles I cannot see much that is left unless they eat one	573.6548461914062
1623/3605	Why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket   Yes said DArtagnan Athos is right it must be	82.37481689453125
1624/3605	And yet if we burn it who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes   He must have one said Ath	152.69076538085938
1625/3605	What will you do with the letter then asked Porth	22.798564910888672
1626/3605	As a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of	146.8965301513672
1627/3605	Grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed	77.22027587890625
1628/3605	Bravo Monsieur Grimaud said Athos and now take	57.38189697265625
1629/3605	Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less	520.4207763671875
1630/3605	And now said Athos unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up Grimaud I think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the	210.12477111816406
1631/3605	Meantime his Eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches These four men must positively be	1067.550048828125

1633/3605	We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflectiona dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she	293.9742736816406
1634/3605	On two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her that she has	535.5303344726562
1635/3605	DArtagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of	564.1192016601562
1636/3605	He has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her	444.7158508300781
1637/3605	Still more he has lifted the corner of her maskthat shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so	267.24627685546875
1638/3605	DArtagnan has turned aside from Buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him in the person of the	172.37716674804688
1639/3605	DArtagnan had passed himself upon her as De Wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her	271.6468200683594
1640/3605	DArtagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without	128.50833129882812
1641/3605	All this she owes to DArtagnan without	92.13333129882812
1642/3605	From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from him He alone could have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of	237.0127410888672
1643/3605	Bonacieux against Buckingham but above all against DArtagnanprojects lost in the distance of the	266.97344970703125
1644/3605	Yes but in order to avenge herself she must be	77.15266418457031
1645/3605	And to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floorall undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give	429.25567626953125
1646/3605	Besides to do all this time is necessarymonths years and she has ten or twelve days as Lord de Winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told	264.6535339355469
1647/3605	But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in rep	1323.8231201171875
1648/3605	Go to go to I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate	162.0123748779297
1649/3605	No violence violence is the proof of	1529.50048828125
1650/3605	In the first place I have never succeeded by that	50.35857391357422

1652/3605	Let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my	205.4780731201172
1653/3605	Then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her	314.1202697753906
1654/3605	At length she murmured satisfied with herself Come nothing is lost I am still	389.8072814941406
1655/3605	It was then nearly eight oclock in the	16.95907974243164
1656/3605	Milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her	324.9820861816406
1657/3605	A better idea however came into her mind before going to	731.290283203125
1658/3605	She had heard something said about	753.393798828125
1659/3605	She had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a rep	152.36929321289062
1660/3605	The prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was	145.0542755126953
1661/3605	A light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jail	183.6984405517578
1662/3605	Milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging	237.08497619628906
1663/3605	The bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its	488.86724853515625
1664/3605	Steps sounded in the chamber and drew	125.2968978881836
1665/3605	Place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of Fel	241.06622314453125
1666/3605	You will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued Fel	985.6032104492188
1667/3605	And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say	270.0515441894531
1668/3605	Feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained	271.11688232421875
1669/3605	At length Felton who had not yet looked at Milady turned toward	338.4642639160156
1670/3605	Ah ah said he she is asleep thats	296.1073303222656
1671/3605	And he made some steps toward the	49.80161666870117
1672/3605	But my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached Milady this woman is not	563.9137573242188
1673/3605	What not asleep said Felton what is she doing then   She has f	175.31544494628906
1674/3605	Her face is very pale and I have listened in vain I do not hear her	177.1721954345703
1675/3605	You are right said Felton after having looked at Milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward	198.51675415039062
1676/3605	Go and tell Lord de Winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not having been foreseen I dont know what to	75.99430847167969
1677/3605	The soldier went out to obey the orders of his	65.86632537841797
1678/3605	Felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a	81.205322265625
1679/3605	Milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the l	670.8328857421875
1680/3605	She perceived Felton who sat with his back toward	466.63214111328125
1681/3605	She continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round	120.99066925048828
1682/3605	She then thought that Lord de Winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jail	121.12291717529297
1683/3605	Her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her	1921.5140380859375
1684/3605	As a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed	77.17668914794922
1685/3605	Ah you are awake madame he said then I have nothing more to do	47.441226959228516
1686/3605	If you want anything you can	192.99124145507812
1687/3605	Oh my God my God how I have suffered said Milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to	205.79302978515625
1688/3605	And she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she recl	505.961669921875
1689/3605	You will be served thus madame three times a day said	197.2880096435547
1690/3605	In the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at	14.064647674560547
1691/3605	If that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied	191.73220825195312
1692/3605	But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked Mil	530.0084228515625
1693/3605	A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her	182.35791015625
1694/3605	I thank you sir replied the prisoner hum	65.76514434814453
1695/3605	Felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the	80.38526153564453
1696/3605	At the moment he was about to go out Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of Mil	39.41629409790039
1697/3605	He held a vial of salts in his	204.02821350097656
1698/3605	Well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go	112.78457641601562
1699/3605	These words of Feltons passed like ice through her	2970.810546875
1700/3605	In that case my brave lieutenant let us leave Milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy She has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the	213.62039184570312
1701/3605	And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton and led him out	113.84307098388672
1702/3605	On my honor they are not	110.20818328857422
1703/3605	I have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir I have full and perfect confidence in	61.76632308959961
1704/3605	Adieu dear sister till your next swoon   This was all that Milady could	566.4403076171875
1705/3605	Her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized	214.36170959472656
1706/3605	She cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was	137.74386596679688
1707/3605	The blade was round and of flexible	1841.637939453125
1708/3605	A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door	138.99404907226562
1709/3605	Ha ha cried Lord de Winter ha ha Dont you see my brave Felton dont you see what I told you That knife was for you my lad she would have killed	154.9510040283203
1710/3605	Observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother	615.8190307617188
1711/3605	If I had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of	112.71286010742188
1712/3605	Then no more of Felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody el	504.8843994140625
1713/3605	See John see how well she knows how to handle a	1671.9720458984375
1714/3605	In fact Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her	651.0029907226562
1715/3605	You were right my Lord said Felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady you were right my Lord and I was	113.9603271484375
1716/3605	But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the	203.37025451660156
1717/3605	I am lost murmured she I am lost I am in the power of men upon whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my	179.947998046875
1718/3605	It is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed   In fact as this last reflection indicatedthis instinctive return to hopesentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent	531.0836181640625
1719/3605	Milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little Spanish wine and felt all her resolution	866.718505859375
1720/3605	One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner If I had listened to you Lord de Winter had said to Fel	163.51873779296875
1721/3605	Felton then had spoken in her favor since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to	89.63382720947266
1722/3605	Weak or strong repeated Milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour	734.8876342773438
1723/3605	As to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his	70.53410339355469
1724/3605	It is useless then to attempt anything with	164.88189697265625
1725/3605	He is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of	295.4541931152344
1726/3605	And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her	35.256282806396484
1727/3605	Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next	156.89627075195312
1728/3605	She slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first	1435.6129150390625
1729/3605	In the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in	38.62833786010742
1730/3605	He brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching Miladys bed offered her	137.46932983398438
1731/3605	Milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first	464.4690246582031
1732/3605	I am in a fever said she I have not slept a single instant during all this long	131.41600036621094
1733/3605	Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday All I ask is permission to remain ab	395.4886474609375
1734/3605	Would you like to have a physician called said the	297.2703857421875
1735/3605	Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a	199.537353515625
1736/3605	Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and Lord de Winter would redouble his	340.5760192871094
1737/3605	Besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and Milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the	564.263671875
1738/3605	Go and fetch a physician said	454.4308166503906
1739/3605	What could be the good of that These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy it would be just the same today no doubtfor since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a	155.10150146484375
1740/3605	Then said Felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish	1394.59423828125
1741/3605	Eh how can I tell My God I know that I suffer thats	118.83746337890625
1742/3605	Give me anything you like it is of little	328.1422119140625
1743/3605	Go and fetch Lord de Winter said Felton tired of these eternal	1489.76416015625
1744/3605	Oh no no cried Milady no sir do not call him I conjure	154.39010620117188
1745/3605	I am well I want nothing do not call	110.5452880859375
1746/3605	She gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the	188.8743896484375
1747/3605	Meanwhile madame if you really suffer said Felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive uswell it will be the worse for	134.75857543945312
1748/3605	But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with	42.88290023803711
1749/3605	Milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking so	281.48309326171875
1750/3605	Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went	258.10540771484375
1751/3605	The woman followed him and Lord de Winter did not	58.43115234375
1752/3605	I fancy I begin to see my way murmured Milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward	297.5061950683594
1753/3605	Now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very	117.46713256835938
1754/3605	I have but ten days and this evening two of them will be	51.04341506958008
1755/3605	In the morning when they entered Miladys chamber they had brought her	227.2041473388672
1756/3605	Now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that Felton would then reapp	481.6675720214844
1757/3605	Felton reappeared and without observing whether Milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready	143.58387756347656
1758/3605	Felton remained behind he held a book in his	136.70901489257812
1759/3605	Milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyr	459.5694274902344
1760/3605	Bartholomew they sometimes came to seek	1180.6446533203125
1761/3605	She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their	386.9698791503906
1762/3605	I will tell it cried Milady with a feigned exultation on the day when I shall have suffered sufficiently for my	168.1058349609375
1763/3605	The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single	274.13946533203125
1764/3605	The young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had	141.23263549804688
1765/3605	I am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Pur	73.3704833984375
1766/3605	Well let my God save me or let me perish for my God That is the reply I beg you to make to Lord de	80.80291748046875
1767/3605	Felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensive	81.48284912109375
1768/3605	Lord de Winter came toward five oclock in the	50.9759521484375
1769/3605	Milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of	289.1054382324219
1770/3605	She received him like a woman who had already recovered all her	111.11949157714844
1771/3605	You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband have you   Explain yourself my Lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though I hear your words I declare I do not understand	238.6135711669922
1772/3605	Then you have no religion at all I like that best replied Lord de Winter	153.72991943359375
1773/3605	Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied Milady frigid	603.0375366210938
1774/3605	Oh I confess it is all the same to	30.826963424682617
1775/3605	Oh you need not avow this religious indifference my Lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for	1392.8916015625
1776/3605	My jailers and my hangmen Heyday madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this	368.43914794921875
1777/3605	As to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be	90.00121307373047
1778/3605	Infamous task impious task cried Milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his	2183.93017578125
1779/3605	My word said de Winter rising I think the hussy is going mad Come come calm yourself Madame Puritan or Ill remove you to a	878.5247192382812
1780/3605	Its my Spanish wine that has got into your head is it not But never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad	134.2766571044922
1781/3605	And Lord de Winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly	1057.7679443359375
1782/3605	Felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this	88.52745056152344
1783/3605	Yes go go said she to her brother the effects _are_ drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun	260.56378173828125
1784/3605	Miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloudprayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere Pur	378.9600524902344
1785/3605	She appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around	40.30790710449219
1786/3605	Felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the	76.16056060791016
1787/3605	Milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to	125.95889282226562
1788/3605	For the moment she wished nothing	557.5411987304688
1789/3605	She arose came to the table ate but little and drank only	605.9904174804688
1790/3605	An hour after her table was cleared but Milady remarked that this time Felton did not accompany the	628.684326171875
1791/3605	He feared then to see her too	374.555419921875
1792/3605	She turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed	177.21705627441406
1793/3605	These verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their	285.1387939453125
1794/3605	The soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into	174.57167053222656
1795/3605	Milady was then able to judge of the effect she had	247.89759826660156
1796/3605	Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and	113.06576538085938
1797/3605	It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jail	340.99200439453125
1798/3605	Silence then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized as that of Fel	705.3646240234375
1799/3605	What are you meddling with stupid Did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing	975.9407958984375
1800/3605	You were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to	343.99798583984375
1801/3605	Guard her If she flies kill her but dont exceed your	3934.474609375
1802/3605	An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of	277.8572998046875
1803/3605	Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three Hebrews in the	920.55517578125
1804/3605	Milady continued   One day our doors will ope     With God come our desire And if betrays that hope     To death we can	685.3519287109375
1805/3605	This verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young	633.3828735351562
1806/3605	He opened the door quickly and Milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost	116.01769256591797
1807/3605	Why do you sing thus and with such a voice said	125.69837951660156
1808/3605	Your pardon sir said Milady with mild	370.00323486328125
1809/3605	I forgot that my songs are out of place in this	184.8035888671875
1810/3605	I have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so I	89.78016662597656
1811/3605	Pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was	420.3353271484375
1812/3605	Milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before	79.16082000732422
1813/3605	Yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the	141.8135986328125
1814/3605	The poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while Milady was reading with her lynxs eyes the very depths of his	375.52703857421875
1815/3605	I will be silent then said Milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her	175.7605743408203
1816/3605	No no madame said Felton only do not sing so loud particularly at	479.3476867675781
1817/3605	And at these words Felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the	299.0382385253906
1818/3605	You have done right Lieutenant said the	1674.13720703125
1819/3605	Such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so	327.76251220703125
1820/3605	CAPTIVITY THE THIRD DAY     Felton had fallen but there was still another step to be	6891.888671875
1821/3605	He must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and Milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this	400.58160400390625
1822/3605	He must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor Milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language	532.6469116210938
1823/3605	Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might failfor Felton was forewarned and that against the least	366.7837219238281
1824/3605	From that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestureseven to a breath that could be interpreted as a	385.86065673828125
1825/3605	In short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not	522.5618286132812
1826/3605	Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more	181.503662109375
1827/3605	She had laid that down the preceding	401.9529724121094
1828/3605	To remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignationsuch was her	343.1519775390625
1829/3605	Felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would	125.77871704101562
1830/3605	In the morning Felton came as usual but Milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to	164.45504760742188
1831/3605	It was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale English sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her	726.5576782226562
1832/3605	Milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it	64.67137145996094
1833/3605	Ah ah said Lord de Winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy   The prisoner made no	252.49734497070312
1834/3605	Yes yes continued Lord de Winter I	35.795413970947266
1835/3605	Patience patience In four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to youmore open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days England will be relieved of	196.57022094726562
1836/3605	Milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven Lord Lord said she with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone pardon this man as I myself pardon	673.02734375
1837/3605	Yes pray accursed woman cried the baron your prayer is so much the more generous from your being I swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you and he went	58.723289489746094
1838/3605	At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived Felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by	158.5352020263672
1839/3605	Then she threw herself upon her knees and began to	34.184810638427734
1840/3605	My God my God said she thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer give me then strength to	505.8080139160156
1841/3605	I do not like to disturb those who pray madame said Felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account I beseech	72.49913024902344
1842/3605	How do you know I was praying sir said Milady in a voice broken by so	92.87581634521484
1843/3605	You were deceived sir I was not	329.2889404296875
1844/3605	Guilty Oh my God thou knowest whether I am guilty Say I am condemned sir if you please but you know that God who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be	291.7763977050781
1845/3605	Were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied Felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and I myself would aid you with my	499.6203918457031
1846/3605	Oh you are a just man cried Milady throwing herself at his	79.17799377441406
1847/3605	I can hold out no longer for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my	71.21786499023438
1848/3605	Listen then to the supplication of a despairing	202.64849853515625
1849/3605	You are abused sir but that is not the	123.34947204589844
1850/3605	I only ask you one favor and if you grant it me I will bless you in this world and in the	39.45052719116211
1851/3605	Speak to the master madame said Felton happily I am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor	548.2543334960938
1852/3605	It is upon one higher placed than I am that God has laid this	1116.670654296875
1853/3605	What do you say Oh you do not understand me When I speak of ignominy you think I speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or	121.87101745605469
1854/3605	Would to heaven Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death   It is I who no longer understand you madame said Fel	242.2633819580078
1855/3605	Or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredul	53.668434143066406
1856/3605	No madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a	36.959228515625
1857/3605	What you are ignorant of Lord de Winters designs upon me   I	36.52097702026367
1858/3605	Impossible you are his confidant   I never lie mad	133.22573852539062
1859/3605	Oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine	422.44818115234375
1860/3605	I seek to divine nothing madame I wait till I am confided in and apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to	105.63587188720703
1861/3605	Good said Milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime Then aloud The friend of that wretch is capable of	144.36294555664062
1862/3605	Whom do you call _that wretch_ asked Fel	889.2399291992188
1863/3605	Are there then in England two men to whom such an epithet can be applied   You mean George Villiers asked Felton whose looks became	847.7919311523438
1864/3605	Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham replied Mil	7035.44384765625
1865/3605	I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all England who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom I was	54.39646911621094
1866/3605	The hand of the Lord is stretched over him said Felton he will not escape the chastisement he	528.9417724609375
1867/3605	Felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the Catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the Puritans styled simply	1162.9324951171875
1868/3605	At length he interrogates me said Milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great	396.59210205078125
1869/3605	Oh know him Yes yes to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and Milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of	167.79412841796875
1870/3605	Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped	157.57464599609375
1871/3605	He still doubts thought Milady I have not been earnest	539.390625
1872/3605	Someone was heard in the corridor Milady recognized the step of Lord de	74.78573608398438
1873/3605	Felton recognized it also and made a step toward the	304.62353515625
1874/3605	Felton gently repulsed Milady and she sank into a	183.1293487548828
1875/3605	Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die	109.36075592041016
1876/3605	Felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the	186.73492431640625
1877/3605	Ah said Milady listening in her turn to the noise of Feltons steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter at length you are mine   Then her brow	199.08355712890625
1878/3605	If he tells the baron said she I am lostfor the baron who knows very well that I shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but	97.99080657958984
1879/3605	She placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more	295.27349853515625
1880/3605	Oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell him   In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the	119.30854797363281
1881/3605	Sir said Milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me   How dear sister said Lord de	420.7351989746094
1882/3605	Besides this time my visit has a	259.3183288574219
1883/3605	Milady trembled she thought Felton had told	1852.0260009765625
1884/3605	Perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so	138.74533081054688
1885/3605	Lord de Winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside	109.6269760131836
1886/3605	Then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it	115.38703155517578
1887/3605	Here said he I want to show you the kind of passport which I have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life I consent to leave	62.10483169555664
1888/3605	Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper he read Order to conduct The name is blank interrupted Lord de	749.3101806640625
1889/3605	If you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London attention will be paid to your	106.32678985595703
1890/3605	I will begin again then   Order to conduct tothe person named Charlotte Backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of France but liberated after chastis	1052.1495361328125
1891/3605	She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from	271.3033752441406
1892/3605	In case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be	123.09487915039062
1893/3605	She will receive five shillings per day for lodging and	3772.228271484375
1894/3605	That order does not concern me replied Milady coldly since it bears another name than	294.3418884277344
1895/3605	A name Have you a name then   I bear that of your	59.4588623046875
1896/3605	My brother is only your second husband and your first is still	261.2719421386719
1897/3605	Tell me his name and I will put it in the place of the name of Charlotte Back	156.34414672851562
1898/3605	No You will not You are silent Well then you must be registered as Charlotte Back	1183.5255126953125
1899/3605	Milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from	336.1872863769531
1900/3605	She believed the order ready for	1596.513427734375
1901/3605	She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure she thought she was condemned to set off that very	109.20613861083984
1902/3605	Everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the	74.03446197509766
1903/3605	The joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal	134.25624084472656
1904/3605	Yes yes said Lord de Winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself All is not lost for that order is not	91.94939422607422
1905/3605	It is only shown to me to terrify me thats	72.65243530273438
1906/3605	Tomorrow this order will be sent to the Duke of	33.32865524291992
1907/3605	The day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal and fourandtwenty hours afterward I will answer for its being carried into	101.64667510986328
1908/3605	That is all I had to say to	33.546443939208984
1909/3605	And I reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous   Would you like better to be hanged in your true name Milady You know that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of	217.6155548095703
1910/3605	Although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of	77.49282836914062
1911/3605	Milady made no reply but became as pale as a	156.63539123535156
1912/3605	Thats well madame and there is an old proverb that says Traveling trains	1752.5826416015625
1913/3605	My faith you are not wrong after all and life is	291.48101806640625
1914/3605	Thats the reason why I take such care you shall not deprive me of	124.35260009765625
1915/3605	There only remains then the question of the five shillings to be	588.1187133789062
1916/3605	You think me rather parsimonious dont you Thats because I dont care to leave you the means of corrupting your jail	727.8347778320312
1917/3605	Besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them	2275.261474609375
1918/3605	Employ them if your check with regard to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that	873.4454345703125
1919/3605	Felton has not told him said Milady to	325.2352600097656
1920/3605	And now madame till I see you again Tomorrow I will come and announce to you the departure of my	66.88414764404297
1921/3605	Lord de Winter rose saluted her ironically and went	166.50225830078125
1922/3605	She had still four days before	130.2285919189453
1923/3605	Four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Fel	1252.9373779296875
1924/3605	A terrible idea however rushed into her	806.9972534179688
1925/3605	She thought that Lord de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the Duke of	214.89041137695312
1926/3605	In that case Felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was	1608.3961181640625
1927/3605	Nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured	153.80227661132812
1928/3605	As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter she placed herself at the table and	37.78659439086914
1929/3605	Then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers	61.93162155151367
1930/3605	As on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to	140.60617065429688
1931/3605	Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her	105.33281707763672
1932/3605	And she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited Felton the evening	1099.23828125
1933/3605	But although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained	2352.916748046875
1934/3605	It appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow	54.052120208740234
1935/3605	But whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to	275.1455078125
1936/3605	However a few instants after she had finished her religious song Milady thought she heard a profound	497.97235107421875
1937/3605	Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with	471.30712890625
1938/3605	At the noise Felton made in entering Milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her	288.7429504394531
1939/3605	The young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish	74.59700775146484
1940/3605	Nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than	317.1824645996094
1941/3605	He advanced slowly toward Milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen What is this madame he asked cold	200.43458557128906
1942/3605	That Nothing said Milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her	147.32984924316406
1943/3605	Ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners I had ennui and I amused myself with twisting that	1213.25927734375
1944/3605	He started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped	438.38037109375
1945/3605	What were you doing on that armchair asked	127.87500762939453
1946/3605	But replied Felton I wish to	335.8799743652344
1947/3605	Do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true Christians are forbidden to	132.43199157714844
1948/3605	Well then said Felton I will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your	97.24075317382812
1949/3605	Remember madame if our God forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns	7123.400390625
1950/3605	When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied Milady in a tone of deep conviction God pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyr	740.5970458984375
1951/3605	You say either too much or too little speak mad	291.3712463378906
1952/3605	In the name of heaven explain	471.434814453125
1953/3605	That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor No	141.4553985595703
1954/3605	You suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life Oh you cannot believe what you say   Let me act as I please Felton let me act as I please said Milady el	120.4222412109375
1955/3605	Every soldier must be ambitious must he not You are a lieutenant Well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of	147.989013671875
1956/3605	But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling Cruel enough if I am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the Lord give it if I am innocent   I am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders I have	180.60183715820312
1957/3605	Do you believe then that at the day of the Last Judgment God will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges You are not willing that I should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my	502.4452819824219
1958/3605	But I repeat it again to you replied Felton in great emotion no danger threatens you I will answer for Lord de Winter as for	141.6610565185547
1959/3605	Impossible madame impossible murmured Felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this	418.3162536621094
1960/3605	A prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through	194.9618377685547
1961/3605	Yes cried Milady but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life I shall lose my honor Felton and it is you you whom I make responsible before God and before men for my shame and my inf	186.50790405273438
1962/3605	This time Felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of	132.44140625
1963/3605	She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young	652.29931640625
1964/3605	Felton stood before this strange apparition like one pet	186.50961303710938
1965/3605	Who art thou Who art thou cried he clasping his	144.0329132080078
1966/3605	Yes yes said Felton I doubted but now I	377.16796875
1967/3605	Yes yes said Felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last	150.01431274414062
1968/3605	A flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of Mil	244.72076416015625
1969/3605	However fugitive this homicide flash Felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this womans	659.8782958984375
1970/3605	He recalled all at once the warnings of Lord de Winter the seductions of Milady her first attempts after her	615.0633544921875
1971/3605	He drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her	69.73905944824219
1972/3605	Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this	472.7627258300781
1973/3605	Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned	800.0369873046875
1974/3605	The sword of the eternal is too heavy for my	762.59375
1975/3605	Allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyr	167.80374145507812
1976/3605	I do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a	318.76263427734375
1977/3605	I supplicate you I implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my pres	109.54170227050781
1978/3605	Hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast Felton reproached	1299.9066162109375
1979/3605	Alas said Felton I can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim But Lord de Winter makes cruel accusations against	158.8325653076172
1980/3605	You are a Christian you are my sister in	182.6603240966797
1981/3605	I feel myself drawn toward youI who have never loved anyone but my benefactorI who have met with nothing but traitors and impious	143.23854064941406
1982/3605	But you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you	416.4450378417969
1983/3605	They have eyes repeated Milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear	161.18287658691406
1984/3605	Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fasc	191.6121368408203
1985/3605	Felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his	142.7818603515625
1986/3605	He paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he	83.33282470703125
1987/3605	During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly and when Lord de Winter entered he was several paces from the	109.78380584716797
1988/3605	The baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young	146.74755859375
1989/3605	You have been here a very long time John said	175.989013671875
1990/3605	Has this woman been relating her crimes to you In that case I can comprehend the length of the	173.39857482910156
1991/3605	Felton started and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Pur	111.41374206542969
1992/3605	Ah you fear your prisoner should escape said	828.5897216796875
1993/3605	Well ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of	789.3232421875
1994/3605	You demanded a favor said the baron suspicious	532.6776733398438
1995/3605	Yes my Lord replied the young man	117.88168334960938
1996/3605	And what favor pray asked Lord de	385.6257629394531
1997/3605	A knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied Fel	191.32772827148438
1998/3605	There is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de Winter in an ironical contemptuous	200.3754425048828
1999/3605	I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn replied Lord de	173.9320526123047
2000/3605	Believe me the cord is more certain than the	315.1003112792969
2001/3605	Felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her	174.87811279296875
2002/3605	You are right said she I have often thought of	36.018943786621094
2003/3605	Then she added in a low voice And I will think of it	28.97441291809082
2004/3605	Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably Lord de Winter perceived this	415.81878662109375
2005/3605	I have placed reliance upon you my	188.9350128173828
2006/3605	Beware I have warned you But be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where I shall send her she can harm	383.79443359375
2007/3605	You hear him cried Milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that Felton might understand she was addressing	217.1195068359375
2008/3605	The baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone	46.38554000854492
2009/3605	Well said the prisoner when the door was shut I am not so far advanced as I	71.05247497558594
2010/3605	De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prud	423.5252380371094
2011/3605	It is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man As to Felton he hes	1660.8096923828125
2012/3605	Ah he is not a man like that cursed DArtagn	41.10385513305664
2013/3605	A Puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his	515.1586303710938
2014/3605	A Musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round	230.75733947753906
2015/3605	Milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing Felton	547.2312622070312
2016/3605	At last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the	47.674644470214844
2017/3605	Presently the door opened and she perceived Fel	324.7622985839844
2018/3605	The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to Milady to be silent his face was much	66.3028793334961
2019/3605	What do you want with me said	25.1975154876709
2020/3605	Listen replied Felton in a low	193.39805603027344
2021/3605	I have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being	58.33238220214844
2022/3605	The baron has just related a frightful story to	59.012413024902344
2023/3605	Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her	612.3261108398438
2024/3605	Either you are a demon continued Felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a	565.2698364257812
2025/3605	I have known you four days I have loved him four	56.225093841552734
2026/3605	Be not alarmed at what I say I want to be	99.66231536865234
2027/3605	Tonight after twelve I will come and see you and you shall convince	76.51145935058594
2028/3605	No Felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and I feel what it must cost	127.30305480957031
2029/3605	No I am lost do not be lost with	75.42096710205078
2030/3605	My death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the	77.32849884033203
2031/3605	Be silent madame cried Felton and do not speak to me thus I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your	81.10184478759766
2032/3605	I will not promise said Milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have and if I make a promise I must keep	78.95645904541016
2033/3605	Well said Felton only promise till you have seen me	578.2230224609375
2034/3605	If when you have seen me again you still persistwell then you shall be free and I myself will give you the weapon you	85.55856323242188
2035/3605	Well said Milady for you I will	71.14472198486328
2036/3605	Are you satisfied   Well said Felton till	908.0455322265625
2037/3605	And he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldiers halfpike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his	47.966468811035156
2038/3605	The soldier returned and Felton gave him back his	691.6167602539062
2039/3605	Then through the grating to which she had drawn near Milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of	129.51609802246094
2040/3605	As for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of God by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know	239.0225067138672
2041/3605	My God said she what a senseless fanatic My God it is IIand this fellow who will help me to avenge	386.7781982421875
2042/3605	CAPTIVITY THE FIFTH DAY     Milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her	20048.48046875
2043/3605	It was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her	387.3435363769531
2044/3605	Milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the	207.16600036621094
2045/3605	But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of	515.0785522460938
2046/3605	Religion and its observances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary sed	11058.8525390625
2047/3605	There fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material lovethat sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with	1530.5159912109375
2048/3605	Milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and	279.3576965332031
2049/3605	In short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her	676.336181640625
2050/3605	Many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of	341.6378479003906
2051/3605	Milady being well prepared for the reception of Felton was able to erect her batteries for the next	329.062744140625
2052/3605	To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of	193.58921813964844
2053/3605	Like all persons of real genius Milady knew what suited her nature and her	664.7950439453125
2054/3605	Poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her	325.8968811035156
2055/3605	Milady was only a queen while among	1271.895263671875
2056/3605	The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her	4204.73876953125
2057/3605	To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for	1776.75244140625
2058/3605	She should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last For an active ambitious nature like that of Milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious	619.118408203125
2059/3605	For the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her	166.1669158935547
2060/3605	Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the	170.0694122314453
2061/3605	The cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius You should not have allowed yourself to be	349.7598876953125
2062/3605	Time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the	140.44729614257812
2063/3605	At nine oclock Lord de Winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or Milady pronouncing a single	214.64288330078125
2064/3605	Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless	283.9189453125
2065/3605	Well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight   At ten oclock Felton came and placed the sent	66.10769653320312
2066/3605	She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet Milady at the same time detested and despised this weak	138.1739044189453
2067/3605	Two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was	617.490966796875
2068/3605	This time it _was_ the hour and from this moment Milady waited with impat	249.9491424560547
2069/3605	The new sentinel commenced his walk in the	520.1486206054688
2070/3605	At the expiration of ten minutes Felton	737.4540405273438
2071/3605	Listen said the young man to the sent	18.426517486572266
2072/3605	On no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although I during his absence watched in his	262.6866760253906
2073/3605	Yes I know it said the	47.30549621582031
2074/3605	I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest	233.49636840820312
2075/3605	For my part I am going to pay a second visit to this woman who I fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and I have received orders to watch	108.90473937988281
2076/3605	Good murmured Milady the austere Puritan	843.279541015625
2077/3605	As to the soldier he only	339.16253662109375
2078/3605	Zounds Lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my Lord has authorized you to look into her	778.2473754882812
2079/3605	Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare	264.32537841796875
2080/3605	I promised to come said Felton and I have	243.2458038330078
2081/3605	What my God said the young man who in spite of his selfcommand felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his	35.825714111328125
2082/3605	You promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our	137.64755249023438
2083/3605	Say no more of that madame said Fel	348.9403076171875
2084/3605	There is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of God to inflict death upon	610.1988525390625
2085/3605	I have reflected and I cannot must not be guilty of such a	91.48677062988281
2086/3605	Ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and I also have	57.01179885864258
2087/3605	Upon what   That I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his	25.350339889526367
2088/3605	Here is the knife said Felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his	133.8728790283203
2089/3605	For what purpose   Upon my honor I will instantly return it to	75.08509826660156
2090/3605	You shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and	143.1603546142578
2091/3605	Felton offered the weapon to Milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her	199.2871856689453
2092/3605	Well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good	268.4014892578125
2093/3605	Felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the	100.27240753173828
2094/3605	Milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of	43.385948181152344
2095/3605	The young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour	325.11724853515625
2096/3605	Felton said Milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to	125.3018569946289
2097/3605	While yet young unfortunately handsome I was dragged into a sn	532.55322265625
2098/3605	Ambushes and violences multiplied around me but I	5028.0673828125
2099/3605	The religion I serve the God I adore were blasphemed because I called upon that religion and that God but still I	1389.1063232421875
2100/3605	Then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body	978.8690185546875
2101/3605	Finally   Milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her	46.34104537963867
2102/3605	Finally said Felton finally what did they do   At length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not	240.31298828125
2103/3605	One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my	1486.7694091796875
2104/3605	Scarcely had I finished my repast when I felt myself sink by degrees into a strange tor	172.74851989746094
2105/3605	Although I was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and I tried to struggle against sleep	557.04931640625
2106/3605	I wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their	125.97733306884766
2107/3605	It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its	174.25048828125
2108/3605	I could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over	204.97850036621094
2109/3605	I supported myself by a chair feeling that I was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak	267.1647033691406
2110/3605	I fell upon one knee then upon	407.843994140625
2111/3605	I tried to pray but my tongue was	709.5953369140625
2112/3605	God doubtless neither heard nor saw me and I sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled	258.4337463378906
2113/3605	Of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted I have no	203.79466247558594
2114/3605	The only thing I recollect is that I awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the	152.87100219726562
2115/3605	No door gave entrance to the	305.07763671875
2116/3605	It might be called a magnificent	236.48959350585938
2117/3605	It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in or to take account of the details I	116.92579650878906
2118/3605	My mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which I could not rouse	174.0242156982422
2119/3605	At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I believed myself	338.0046081542969
2120/3605	My clothes were near me on a chair I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to	462.1222229003906
2121/3605	Then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste ter	2820.254638671875
2122/3605	I was no longer in the house where I had dw	34.75942611694336
2123/3605	As well as I could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds	107.7167739868164
2124/3605	The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish	157.17970275878906
2125/3605	Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend Felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my	310.5885925292969
2126/3605	Yes it was a prison for I tried in vain to get out of	44.19880294799805
2127/3605	I sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat	495.9375305175781
2128/3605	I made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was	62.877601623535156
2129/3605	I sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an arm	338.19439697265625
2130/3605	Meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors	7394.5166015625
2131/3605	I did not know but I had better remain where I was	54.66499328613281
2132/3605	It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every	180.82992553710938
2133/3605	Although I had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling	369.57122802734375
2134/3605	No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me I only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of October and it was quite	96.7912368774414
2135/3605	All at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me	64.3116683959961
2136/3605	A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and I perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of	200.8402557373047
2137/3605	A table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the	237.54022216796875
2138/3605	That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding	81.06998443603516
2139/3605	Oh yes scoundrel cried Milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange rec	209.654296875
2140/3605	Oh yes scoundrel He believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was	534.7928466796875
2141/3605	He came hoping that I would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my	132.37478637695312
2142/3605	All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words I poured out upon this	93.66876983642578
2143/3605	Doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his	140.68577575683594
2144/3605	Then when he thought I had said all he advanced toward me I sprang toward the table I seized a knife I placed it to my	65.67223358154297
2145/3605	Take one step more said I and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself	109.17266845703125
2146/3605	There was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he	846.2228393554688
2147/3605	Your death said he oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after I have had the happiness to possess you only a single	106.72833251953125
2148/3605	Adieu my charmer I will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better	292.3146057128906
2149/3605	At these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and	253.18019104003906
2150/3605	I found myself again in complete	524.4507446289062
2151/3605	The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and I was completely	1039.2198486328125
2152/3605	This moment was frightful if I had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming	223.6318817138672
2153/3605	I was in the power of a man whom I not only detested but despisedof a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to	59.38015365600586
2154/3605	But who then was this man asked Fel	1140.5513916015625
2155/3605	I passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and I was again in	163.42115783691406
2156/3605	But the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecut	93.78515625
2157/3605	Day came the table had disappeared only I had still the knife in my	225.72796630859375
2158/3605	Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes I had not dared to sleep a single	494.79217529296875
2159/3605	The light of day reassured me I went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which I concealed under my	305.3330383300781
2160/3605	When I awoke a fresh meal was	1638.253173828125
2161/3605	This time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony I began to feel a devouring	285.5766296386719
2162/3605	It was fortyeight hours since I had taken any nour	102.00680541992188
2163/3605	I ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk I would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing	289.5552062988281
2164/3605	And yet notwithstanding these precautions I remained for some time in a terrible agitation of	216.40011596679688
2165/3605	But my fears were this time illfounded I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I	679.5160522460938
2166/3605	I took the precaution to half empty the _carafe_ in order that my suspicions might not be	109.58145904541016
2167/3605	The evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to	817.2686767578125
2168/3605	I saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my	250.47085571289062
2169/3605	In an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more light	126.15750122070312
2170/3605	I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into	913.7433471679688
2171/3605	Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank	407.6954345703125
2172/3605	At the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the	74.9105453491211
2173/3605	I paused but I had already drunk half a	212.8556671142578
2174/3605	I threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my	473.7378234863281
2175/3605	No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly	350.2303466796875
2176/3605	I dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense I had leftmy saving knife but I could not reach the	305.5528259277344
2177/3605	I sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then I felt that I was	112.9471664428711
2178/3605	Felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole	153.8285369873047
2179/3605	It is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less fright	31.12860107421875
2180/3605	I saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then I heard the wellknown creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but	90.94109344482422
2181/3605	I felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the	394.59918212890625
2182/3605	I wished to make an effort I attempted to cry	88.34127044677734
2183/3605	By an incredible effort of will I even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecut	233.4454803466797
2184/3605	Tell me who this man was cried the young	218.92581176757812
2185/3605	Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single p	347.502685546875
2186/3605	The more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge	413.025390625
2187/3605	She continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to	62.997589111328125
2188/3605	Only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal	106.49539947509766
2189/3605	I have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties I retained the sense of my	111.08150482177734
2190/3605	I felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my sw	510.1800231933594
2191/3605	Felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of	251.04791259765625
2192/3605	The sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his	402.16802978515625
2193/3605	My first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife I had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for exp	168.35379028320312
2194/3605	But on taking this knife Felton a terrible idea occurred to	510.4914855957031
2195/3605	I have sworn to tell you all and I will tell you	10.987215042114258
2196/3605	I have promised you the truth I will tell it were it to destroy	77.7656021118164
2197/3605	The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried Fel	255.62686157226562
2198/3605	The idea was not that of a Christian I knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my	670.3360595703125
2199/3605	In short what shall I say to you Felton continued Milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a	167.5823211669922
2200/3605	This idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the	239.16354370117188
2201/3605	Continue continue said Felton I am eager to see you attain your vengeance   Oh I resolved that it should take place as soon as	167.30271911621094
2202/3605	I had no doubt he would return the following	84.88133239746094
2203/3605	During the day I had nothing to	39.08036422729492
2204/3605	When the hour of breakfast came therefore I did not hesitate to eat and	186.12083435058594
2205/3605	I had determined to make believe sup but to eat	611.6705932617188
2206/3605	I was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the	228.0691680908203
2207/3605	Only I concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained fortyeight hours without eating or	179.2144012451172
2208/3605	The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution I had formed only I took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for I had no doubt I was	93.25636291503906
2209/3605	Several times even I felt a smile on my	99.01053619384766
2210/3605	Felton I dare not tell you at what idea I smiled you would hold me in horror   Go on go on said Felton you see plainly that I listen and that I am anxious to know the	102.2115478515625
2211/3605	Evening came the ordinary events took	3845.396484375
2212/3605	During the darkness as before my supper was	393.1108093261719
2213/3605	Then the lamp was lighted and I sat down to	74.75411224365234
2214/3605	I pretended to pour out water from the jug but I only drank that which I had saved in my	189.20620727539062

2290/3605	Felton was a Puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her	269.38031005859375

2310/3605	Yes said Milady Lord de Winter and now you can understand it all can you not Buckingham remained nearly a year	256.3724670410156

2312/3605	Whence came the blow God who knows all knows without doubt but as for me I accuse	888.0619506835938
2313/3605	Oh what an abyss what an abyss cried Fel	12468.986328125
2314/3605	Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his	748.2116088867188
2315/3605	The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the	131.729248046875
2316/3605	Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless	1027.679931640625

2318/3605	I went to France with a determination to remain there for the rest of my	52.762351989746094

2320/3605	Communication being closed by the war I was in want of	482.43878173828125
2321/3605	I was then obliged to come back	38.60567092895508
2322/3605	Six days ago I landed at	1734.9345703125
2323/3605	Well Buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my	474.4418029785156
2324/3605	He spoke of me to Lord de Winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded	257.114990234375
2325/3605	The noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend	116.39371490478516
2326/3605	Lord de Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe	94.22574615478516
2327/3605	He caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your	250.86328125
2328/3605	The day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the	468.11724853515625

2331/3605	No you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your	373.2944641113281
2332/3605	Milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but Felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a div	861.2474365234375

2335/3605	Several strokes resounded on the door this time Milady really pushed him away from	381.6435546875

2337/3605	Then run to the door and open it	178.66090393066406
2338/3605	Felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole	463.62310791015625
2339/3605	He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watchpat	1414.0374755859375
2340/3605	Well what is the matter asked the young	24.127931594848633
2341/3605	You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the	66.81822204589844
2342/3605	I heard you cry out without understanding what you	116.01564025878906
2343/3605	I tried to open the door but it was locked inside then I called the	106.0316162109375
2344/3605	And here I am said the	38.77252960205078
2345/3605	Felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speech	1638.828125
2346/3605	Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the	223.61215209960938
2347/3605	She ran to the table and seizing the knife which Felton had laid down exclaimed And by what right will you prevent me from dying   Great God exclaimed Felton on seeing the knife glitter in her	322.2554016113281
2348/3605	At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	96.47357177734375
2349/3605	The baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the	138.9626922607422
2350/3605	Ah said he here we are at the last act of the	45.32154083251953
2351/3605	You see Felton the drama has gone through all the phases I named but be easy no blood will	1626.6253662109375
2352/3605	Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate and terrible proof of her	1194.70751953125
2353/3605	You are mistaken my Lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow   Felton uttered a cry and rushed toward	192.41978454589844
2354/3605	He was too late Milady had stabbed	302.0254211425781
2355/3605	But the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of	574.3939208984375
2356/3605	It had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the	748.179443359375
2357/3605	Miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a	360.08294677734375
2358/3605	Milady fell down and seemed to be in a sw	110.49970245361328
2359/3605	See my Lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself   Be at ease Felton said Lord de	89.23555755615234
2360/3605	She is not dead demons do not die so	343.3580627441406
2361/3605	Be tranquil and go wait for me in my	182.44749450683594
2362/3605	But my Lord   Go sir I command you   At this injunction from his superior Felton obeyed but in going out he put the knife into his bos	133.55943298339844
2363/3605	As to Lord de Winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on Milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them	77.74880981445312
2364/3605	Meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a	508.0504455566406
2365/3605	ESCAPE     As Lord de Winter had thought Miladys wound was not	701.3473510742188
2366/3605	So soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her	38.27381896972656
2367/3605	It was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Mil	583.711669921875
2368/3605	Thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all	304.4383850097656
2369/3605	But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from	130.20350646972656
2370/3605	There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced Felton was	1156.6031494140625
2371/3605	If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the	219.5119171142578
2372/3605	Milady smiled at this thought for Felton was now her only hopeher only means of	1524.4254150390625
2373/3605	But Lord de Winter might suspect him Felton himself might now be watched   Toward four oclock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time Milady stabbed herself however short the wound had	255.5672607421875
2374/3605	The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by Miladys pulse that the case was not	388.328857421875
2375/3605	In the morning Milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended	151.32952880859375
2376/3605	She had one hope which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast hour but Felton did not	331.5832214355469
2377/3605	Were her fears realized Was Felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment She had only one day	741.4295654296875
2378/3605	Lord de Winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twenty	718.2194213867188
2379/3605	Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for	347.4634094238281
2380/3605	Although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual	126.53119659423828
2381/3605	Milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was	256.2250671386719
2382/3605	Then she ventured to ask what had become of Fel	126.74382019042969
2383/3605	She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horse	44.19207000732422
2384/3605	She inquired if the baron was still at the	98.80424499511719
2385/3605	The soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to	36.942787170410156
2386/3605	Milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left	81.90980529785156
2387/3605	The soldier went out leaving the dinner	783.5676879882812
2388/3605	This was the last blow to the	104.4193115234375
2389/3605	The bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of	209.9243927001953
2390/3605	She cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the gr	130.46011352539062
2391/3605	He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her	745.2398681640625
2392/3605	She was free now to give way to her transports without being	238.70199584960938
2393/3605	She traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron	366.15582275390625
2394/3605	_Certes_ if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the bar	224.45587158203125
2395/3605	At six oclock Lord de Winter came	54.74241638183594
2396/3605	This man in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jail	138.81256103515625
2397/3605	He appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate	1487.0452880859375
2398/3605	A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	121.79027557373047
2399/3605	Ay said he I see but you shall not kill me	57.24140548706055
2400/3605	You have no longer a weapon and besides I am on my	102.01561737060547
2401/3605	You had begun to pervert my poor Fel	1140.026611328125
2402/3605	He was yielding to your infernal influence but I will save	208.5330352783203
2403/3605	He will never see you again all is	71.87969970703125
2404/3605	I had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will	249.87667846679688
2405/3605	Tomorrow by twelve oclock I shall have the order for your exile signed _Buckingham	324.15997314453125
2406/3605	If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains	269.65484619140625
2407/3605	If when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the	188.65054321289062
2408/3605	_Au revoir_ then that is all I have to say	95.4651870727539
2409/3605	Tomorrow I will see you again to take my	27.95134735107422
2410/3605	With these words the baron went	100.8034896850586
2411/3605	Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her	405.5933532714844
2412/3605	Milady felt that she stood in need of all her	135.95877075195312
2413/3605	She did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a	229.8158416748047
2414/3605	Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her	714.5549926757812
2415/3605	The thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her	200.2738037109375
2416/3605	It appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their	630.8596801757812
2417/3605	She howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with	287.75469970703125
2418/3605	All at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the	63.279144287109375
2419/3605	She ran to the window and opened	23.45201873779297
2420/3605	Yes said Felton but silence silence I must have time to file through these	534.5478515625
2421/3605	Only take care that I am not seen through the w	86.54002380371094
2422/3605	Oh it is a proof that the Lord is on our side Felton replied Mil	192.1568145751953
2423/3605	They have closed up the grating with a	197.4684295654297
2424/3605	That is well God has made them senseless said Fel	1574.2137451171875
2425/3605	But what must I do asked Mil	115.11840057373047
2426/3605	Go to bed or at least lie down in your	343.9886474609375
2427/3605	As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes of	70.44358825683594
2428/3605	But will you be able to follow me   Oh yes   Your wound   Gives me pain but will not prevent my	108.6391372680664
2429/3605	Be ready then at the first	247.2403106689453
2430/3605	Milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as Felton had desired her to lie down on the	451.2734069824219
2431/3605	Amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the pan	143.43380737304688
2432/3605	She passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the	130.6002197265625
2433/3605	There are hours which last a	1293.3646240234375
2434/3605	At the expiration of an hour Felton tapped	1163.832275390625
2435/3605	Milady sprang out of bed and opened the	124.72125244140625
2436/3605	Two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass	431.8494567871094
2437/3605	Must I take anything with me   Money if you have	80.07820892333984
2438/3605	Yes fortunately they have left me all I	118.6521987915039
2439/3605	So much the better for I have expended all mine in chartering a	483.3257141113281
2440/3605	Here said Milady placing a bag full of louis in Feltons	599.52587890625
2441/3605	Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the	33.04615783691406
2442/3605	Now said he will you come   I am	27.501052856445312
2443/3605	Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the	70.10160064697266
2444/3605	She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of	163.991943359375
2445/3605	For the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a	87.29579162597656
2446/3605	I will descend with my eyes	128.3033447265625
2447/3605	Have you confidence in me said Fel	914.3286743164062
2448/3605	You ask that   Put your two hands	185.31072998046875
2449/3605	Cross them thats right   Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handker	143.07000732421875
2450/3605	What are you doing asked Milady with	84.78760528564453
2451/3605	Pass your arms around my neck and fear	129.62225341796875
2452/3605	But I shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to	110.69039916992188
2453/3605	Not a second was to be	127.32503509521484
2454/3605	Milady passed her two arms round Feltons neck and let herself slip out of the	716.4168090820312
2455/3605	Felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by	295.6672668457031
2456/3605	Despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the	180.96319580078125
2457/3605	We are discovered   There was a silence of several	103.60310363769531
2458/3605	But what then is the noise   That of the patrol going their	155.16741943359375
2459/3605	Where is their road   Just under	323.2898254394531
2460/3605	They will discover us   No if it does not light	111.98028564453125
2461/3605	But they will run against the bottom of the	70.46331024169922
2462/3605	Fortunately it is too short by six	204.10955810546875
2463/3605	Here they are My God   Silence   Both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and	202.09825134277344
2464/3605	This was a terrible moment for the fug	57.59409713745117
2465/3605	The noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died	198.85934448242188
2466/3605	Milady breathed a deep sigh and f	190.46270751953125
2467/3605	Near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the	81.75980377197266
2468/3605	He stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his	80.84727478027344
2469/3605	Then he took Milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had	74.5318374633789
2470/3605	He soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whist	108.60546875
2471/3605	A similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four	251.68052673339844
2472/3605	The boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch	432.758544921875
2473/3605	Felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to	757.3319702148438
2474/3605	Fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was	553.3955078125
2475/3605	The little boat bounded over the waves like a	694.5541381835938
2476/3605	To the sloop said Felton and row	1606.0462646484375
2477/3605	The four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of	113.53221893310547
2478/3605	However they left the castle behind that was the principal	224.0738983154297
2479/3605	It was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the	53.31239318847656
2480/3605	A black point floated on the	1235.363037109375
2481/3605	While the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it Felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Miladys hands	315.7457275390625
2482/3605	When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her	411.70635986328125
2483/3605	Milady breathed a sigh and opened her	171.4537811279297
2484/3605	Yes there is the sky here is the sea The air I breathe is the air of liberty Ah thanks Felton thanks   The young man pressed her to his	250.86160278320312
2485/3605	But what is the matter with my hands asked Milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a	100.90462493896484
2486/3605	Milady held out her arms her wrists were	2293.57568359375
2487/3605	Alas said Felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrow	163.7575225830078
2488/3605	Milady looked around her as if in search of	130.83233642578125
2489/3605	It is there said Felton touching the bag of money with his	363.2616882324219
2490/3605	A sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat	1406.501708984375
2491/3605	The one I have hired for	166.8206024169922
2492/3605	Where will it take me   Where you please after you have put me on shore at	159.5104217529297
2493/3605	What are you going to do at Portsmouth asked Mil	133.1088409423828
2494/3605	Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter said Felton with a gloomy	264.19207763671875
2495/3605	As he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your	308.19903564453125
2496/3605	But if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you   How could I know what I was the bearer of   Thats true And you are going to Portsmouth   I have no time to	36.42422103881836
2497/3605	Tomorrow is the twentythird and Buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his	29683.15625
2498/3605	He sets sail tomorrow Where for   For La Roc	1033.8070068359375
2499/3605	He need not sail cried Milady forgetting her usual presence of	375.7647399902344
2500/3605	Be satisfied replied Felton he will not	4036.6494140625
2501/3605	She could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of Buckingham was written there at full	82.38753509521484
2502/3605	Felton cried she you are as great as Judas Maccabeus If you die I will die with you that is all I can say to	178.68492126464844
2503/3605	Felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to Milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much	148.66650390625
2504/3605	An instant after they were on the	101.96085357666016
2505/3605	Captain said Felton this is the person of whom I spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to	126.3058090209961
2506/3605	For a thousand pistoles said the	50.265384674072266
2507/3605	I have paid you five hundred of	56.71970748901367
2508/3605	And here are the other five hundred replied Milady placing her hand upon the bag of	105.3122787475586
2509/3605	No said the captain I make but one bargain and I have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at Boulog	64.80374145507812
2510/3605	And shall we arrive there   Safe and sound as true as my names Jack	1902.286376953125
2511/3605	Well said Milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred I will give you a thousand pist	39.1183967590332
2512/3605	Hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship   Meanwhile said Felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in	560.1217041015625
2513/3605	The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been	101.77781677246094
2514/3605	On her side Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than	536.4271240234375
2515/3605	It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten oclock if he did not return by ten oclock she was to	84.82282257080078
2516/3605	In that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in France at the convent of the Carmelites at Béth	121.2208480834961
2517/3605	WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23 1628     Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her	8630.6416015625
2518/3605	As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward Milady who standing on the deck followed him with her	74.30253601074219
2519/3605	Both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into Miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to	165.45904541015625
2520/3605	Felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted Milady a last time and took his course toward the	509.87017822265625
2521/3605	At the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sl	56.7822151184082
2522/3605	He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and	230.43943786621094
2523/3605	Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter bent with each breath of the	221.05557250976562
2524/3605	Felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James	1866.97705078125
2525/3605	furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Pur	598.2827758789062
2526/3605	This was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an	689.8629150390625
2527/3605	He entered Portsmouth about eight oclock in the	68.83010864257812
2528/3605	The whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the port the troops about to embark were marching toward the	416.0559997558594
2529/3605	Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty covered with dust and streaming with pers	139.9633331298828
2530/3605	His countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and	344.0429382324219
2531/3605	The sentinel wanted to repulse him but Felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said A pressing message from Lord de	153.56082153320312
2532/3605	At the name of Lord de Winter who was known to be one of his Graces most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let Felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval	170.6533203125
2533/3605	At the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his forekne	553.3944091796875

2536/3605	Each was anxious to gain admission before the	172.5174560546875
2537/3605	Patrick who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his	116.39926147460938
2538/3605	The other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the	203.08912658691406
2539/3605	Lieutenant Felton from Lord de Winter said	3176.33203125
2540/3605	From Lord de Winter repeated Buckingham let him come	200.06210327148438
2541/3605	At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pear	187.4157257080078
2542/3605	Why didnt the baron come himself demanded	2157.4814453125
2543/3605	He desired me to tell your Grace replied Felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the	253.70602416992188
2544/3605	Yes I know that said Buckingham he has a	171.5065460205078
2545/3605	It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace replied Fel	503.1141357421875
2546/3605	Well then speak   That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my Lord   Leave us Patrick said Buckingham but remain within sound of the	208.43411254882812
2547/3605	We are alone sir said Buckingham speak   My Lord said Felton the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Back	303.9201354980469
2548/3605	Yes sir and I answered him to bring or send me that order and I would sign	116.60153198242188
2549/3605	Give it to me said the d	13.786542892456055
2550/3605	And taking it from Felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign	36.1050910949707
2551/3605	Pardon my Lord said Felton stopping the duke but does your Grace know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this young woman   Yes sir I know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the	221.7805938720703
2552/3605	Then your Grace knows her real name asked Felton in a sharp	2115.22021484375
2553/3605	I know it and the duke put the quill to the	129.4344940185547
2554/3605	And knowing that real name my Lord replied Felton will you sign it all the same   Doubtless said Buckingham and rather twice than	294.0568542480469
2555/3605	I cannot believe continued Felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this	684.0923461914062
2556/3605	I know it perfectly although I am astonished that you know	54.42487716674805
2557/3605	And will your Grace sign that order without remorse   Buckingham looked at the young man haught	321.5045471191406
2558/3605	Do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that I am very foolish to answer them   Reply to them my Lord said Felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps	214.7066650390625
2559/3605	Buckingham reflected that the young man coming from Lord de Winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and	681.9713745117188
2560/3605	The baron knows as well as myself that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to	495.2677917480469
2561/3605	The duke put his pen to the	49.81350326538086
2562/3605	You will not sign that order my Lord said Felton making a step toward the d	340.2621154785156
2563/3605	I will not sign this order And why not   Because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the	59.98552703857422
2564/3605	I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn said	529.9627075195312
2565/3605	My Lord Milady de Winter is an angel you know that she is and I demand her liberty of	186.84982299804688
2566/3605	Bah Are you mad to talk to me thus said	350.5628356933594
2567/3605	My Lord excuse me I speak as I can I restrain	327.8341064453125
2568/3605	But my Lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too far   What do you say God pardon me cried Buckingham I really think he threatens me   No my Lord I still	109.79631805419922
2569/3605	And I say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many	1295.6455078125
2570/3605	Felton said Buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under	795.091552734375
2571/3605	You will hear me to the end my	134.25669860839844
2572/3605	You have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled	799.9500732421875
2573/3605	Repair your crimes toward her let her go free and I will exact nothing else from	681.5175170898438
2574/3605	You will exact said Buckingham looking at Felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced	355.17584228515625
2575/3605	My Lord continued Felton becoming more excited as he spoke my Lord beware All England is tired of your iniquities my Lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped my Lord you are held in horror by God and	856.9661254882812
2576/3605	God will punish you hereafter but I will punish you here   Ah this is too much cried Buckingham making a step toward the	105.13230895996094
2577/3605	I ask it humbly of you my Lord said he sign the order for the liberation of Milady de	235.1893768310547
2578/3605	Remember that she is a woman whom you have dishon	58.247161865234375
2579/3605	Withdraw sir said Buckingham or I will call my attendant and have you placed in ir	677.7395629882812
2580/3605	You shall not call said Felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with	308.48162841796875
2581/3605	Beware my Lord you are in the hands of God   In the hands of the devil you mean cried Buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely	133.37791442871094
2582/3605	Sign my Lord sign the liberation of Milady de Winter said Felton holding out a paper to the d	331.42181396484375
2583/3605	By force You are joking Holloa Patrick   Sign my Lord  	765.2313232421875
2584/3605	Never   Help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his	38.72871780395508
2585/3605	But Felton did not give him time to draw	162.82369995117188
2586/3605	He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the d	129.21176147460938
2587/3605	At that moment Patrick entered the room crying A letter from France my	845.9347534179688
2588/3605	From France cried Buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter	1491.2823486328125
2589/3605	Felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the	167.0354461669922
2590/3605	Ah traitor cried Buckingham you have killed me   Murder screamed	682.2894897460938
2591/3605	Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes	76.62364959716797
2592/3605	At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick the man whom Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the	91.79545593261719
2593/3605	He found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the	69.78126525878906
2594/3605	Laporte said the duke in a dying voice Laporte do you come from her   Yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of Austria but too late	57.08271408081055
2595/3605	Oh I cannot tell what she says to me My God I am dying   And the duke swoon	126.01651000976562
2596/3605	Meanwhile Lord de Winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of Buckinghams household had all made their way into the	172.69308471679688
2597/3605	Cries of despair resounded on all	113.369384765625
2598/3605	The news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the	331.37078857421875
2599/3605	The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken	251.1792755126953
2600/3605	He recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all	1123.02880859375
2601/3605	Gentlemen said he leave me alone with Patrick and Laporteah is that you De Winter You sent me a strange madman this morning See the state in which he has put	547.365966796875
2602/3605	Oh my Lord cried the baron I shall never console	137.87957763671875
2603/3605	And you would be quite wrong my dear De Winter said Buckingham holding out his hand to	70.38475799560547
2604/3605	I do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us I pray	104.33589172363281
2605/3605	There only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and	152.3668212890625
2606/3605	A physician was sought for but none was yet	927.1290283203125
2607/3605	You will live my Lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of Anne of Austria on his knees before the dukes	159.26119995117188
2608/3605	What has she written to me said Buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me Read me her	338.54547119140625
2609/3605	Obey Laporte do you not see I have no time to lose   Laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the	67.09909057617188
2610/3605	Read said he read I cannot	254.37045288085938
2611/3605	Read then For soon perhaps I shall not hear and I shall die without knowing what she has written to	101.86050415039062
2612/3605	This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France but misfortune upon you my Lord for which I should never console	218.5131072998047
2613/3605	Be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear     to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in	173.35650634765625
2614/3605	And is that allis that all replied Buckingham impatient	742.8226928710938
2615/3605	She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved	90.6788558959961
2616/3605	Ah said Buckingham God be praised My death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger   Laporte burst into	134.97703552246094
2617/3605	Patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were	86.14515686035156
2618/3605	Patrick brought the object desired which Laporte recognized as having belonged to the	309.0478515625
2619/3605	Now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pear	316.716796875
2620/3605	Here Laporte said Buckingham these are the only tokens I ever received from herthis silver casket and these two	274.5404052734375
2621/3605	And you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of Laport	60.17173767089844
2622/3605	Buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of	564.5767211914062
2623/3605	At this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admirals ship where they had been obliged to seek	177.19898986816406
2624/3605	He approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall All is useless said he he is	114.621337890625
2625/3605	At this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and	178.37701416015625
2626/3605	As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead he ran to Felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the	366.4288330078125
2627/3605	Wretch said he to the young man who since the death of Buckingham had regained that coolness and selfpossession which never after abandoned him wretch what have you done   I have avenged myself said	81.65531158447266
2628/3605	Rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but I swear to you that this crime shall be her	67.00985717773438
2629/3605	I dont know what you mean replied Felton quietly and I am ignorant of whom you are speaking my	132.24009704589844
2630/3605	I killed the Duke of Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain I have punished him for his injustice that is	280.5022888183594
2631/3605	De Winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound Felton and could not tell what to think of such insens	225.44398498535156
2632/3605	One thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of Fel	896.1845092773438
2633/3605	At every noise he heard the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with	142.5436248779297
2634/3605	His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he	63.248497009277344
2635/3605	With the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of	155.78504943847656
2636/3605	He grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treacher	137.67767333984375
2637/3605	One last favor my Lord said he to the bar	128.6207733154297
2638/3605	What oclock is it   The baron drew out his	39.76308822631836
2639/3605	It wants ten minutes to nine said	334.9092102050781
2640/3605	Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a	218.671142578125
2641/3605	As soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be	189.61895751953125
2642/3605	The vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the	154.23388671875
2643/3605	God has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his	158.7738037109375
2644/3605	De Winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed	634.0648803710938
2645/3605	Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syll	186.19070434570312
2646/3605	As to Lord de Winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the	37.509700775146484
2647/3605	IN FRANCE     The first fear of the King of England Charles	572.7099609375
2648/3605	He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England the ambassadors of Denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of Holland who was to take back to the port of Flushing the Indian merchantmen of which Charles	318.8713073730469
2649/3605	had made restitution to the United Provin	11514.5537109375
2650/3605	As to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set	754.3711547851562
2651/3605	During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of	219.08338928222656
2652/3605	Germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musket	79.84980773925781
2653/3605	The cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of	248.71231079101562
2654/3605	The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after	69.26309204101562
2655/3605	de Tréville for they were the first to whom he communicated	95.26722717285156
2656/3605	It was then that DArtagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left	83.4130859375
2657/3605	It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had for a cause the danger which M	474.0155334472656
2658/3605	Bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of Béthune with Milady her mortal	582.3877563476562
2659/3605	Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for M	606.9296875
2660/3605	Bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into Lorraine or	382.535400390625
2661/3605	They had not long to wait for an	87.2742691040039
2662/3605	Eight or ten days afterward Aramis received the following letter   MY DEAR COUSIN Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of Béthune the air of which you think is bad for	769.2916259765625
2663/3605	My sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable	607.4248046875
2664/3605	There was no further question therefore about Marie Michon among the four Musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw M	212.12564086914062
2665/3605	Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of Béth	234.6464385986328
2666/3605	It was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at La Rochelle that is to say at the other end of	56.60155487060547
2667/3605	Therefore DArtagnan was going to ask leave of absence of	53.551368713378906
2668/3605	The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the six	86.3598861694336
2669/3605	The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgères to Mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of	691.576904296875
2670/3605	Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heart	833.0020751953125
2671/3605	DArtagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which Porthos explained thus A very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you	269.63128662109375
2672/3605	At length the escort passed through Paris on the twentythird in the	415.908447265625
2673/3605	de Tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the Bast	343.9154968261719
2674/3605	The first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four	1085.6337890625
2675/3605	de Tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nightsfor they set out on the twentyfourth at five oclock in the evening and as a further kindness	299.0750427246094
2676/3605	de Tréville postdated the leave to the morning of the twenty	3117.092041015625
2677/3605	Good Lord said DArtagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at	124.76384735107422
2678/3605	It appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple	48.979671478271484
2679/3605	In two days and by using up two or three horses thats nothing I have plenty of money I am at Béth	355.01446533203125
2680/3605	I present my letter from the queen to the superior and I bring back the dear treasure I go to seeknot into Lorraine not into Belgium but to Paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at La Roc	297.5301818847656
2681/3605	Well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we	205.8856964111328
2682/3605	Remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless	764.0635375976562
2683/3605	Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition	285.1376953125
2684/3605	To this Athos replied quietly We also have money leftfor I have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and Porthos and Aramis have not eaten all	130.4833221435547
2685/3605	We can therefore use up four horses as well as	240.49502563476562
2686/3605	But consider DArtagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that Béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with	218.60044860839844
2687/3605	If you had only to deal with four men DArtagnan I would allow you to go	28.801937103271484
2688/3605	You have to do with that woman We four will go and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient	133.24220275878906
2689/3605	My God what do you fear   Everything replied Ath	39.00706481933594
2690/3605	DArtagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of Athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another	53.54866027832031
2691/3605	DArtagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass	58.34100341796875
2692/3605	What is the matter monsieur said Planc	6.6254472732543945
2693/3605	Oh come gentlemen my master is ill   The three friends hastened toward DArtagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his	45.010475158691406
2694/3605	Well where the devil are you going now cried Ath	30.181560516357422
2695/3605	It is he cried DArtagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he let me overtake him   He What he asked Ath	43.62186050415039

2697/3605	Let the man go DArtagnan let us save the	72.3308334350586
2698/3605	Well eagerly demanded all his three	743.3630981445312

2708/3605	According to the desire of your Eminence I report to the convent of the Carmelites at Béthune where I will await your	207.12808227539062
2709/3605	Accordingly that same evening Milady commenced her	1821.105224609375
2710/3605	Night overtook her she stopped and slept at an	259.810302734375
2711/3605	At five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered Béth	243.8644561767578
2712/3605	She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites and went thither	163.35104370117188
2713/3605	The superior met her Milady showed her the cardinals	546.637451171875
2714/3605	The abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast	2162.07763671875
2715/3605	The evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and	826.7549438476562
2716/3605	After breakfast the abbess came to pay her a	279.9931335449219
2717/3605	There is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new board	639.4758911132812
2718/3605	This was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she	103.7934341430664
2719/3605	She tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole	596.0238647460938
2720/3605	Milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six	158.77040100097656
2721/3605	But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a	132.3012237548828
2722/3605	Milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the	584.9440307617188
2723/3605	She did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle	351.3158874511719
2724/3605	But the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his Emin	415.7991943359375
2725/3605	Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act	242.93515014648438
2726/3605	Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with M	470.0754089355469
2727/3605	dAiguillon Marion de Lorme and several other gay	4409.36572265625
2728/3605	The abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and	1096.070556640625
2729/3605	Good thought Milady she takes a pleasure in my	394.79412841796875
2730/3605	If she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at	383.9374084472656
2731/3605	She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his	131.759033203125
2732/3605	The abbess only crossed herself without approving or disappro	3966.789306640625
2733/3605	This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinal	498.93353271484375
2734/3605	Milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and	6562.89111328125
2735/3605	I am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have	149.54978942871094
2736/3605	And one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal   One of your boarders said Milady oh my God Poor woman I pity her	426.1402587890625
2737/3605	And you have reason for she is much to be pit	87.65157318115234
2738/3605	Imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered	17952.2578125
2739/3605	But after all resumed the abbess Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the	395.1173095703125
2740/3605	Good said Milady to herself who knows I am about perhaps to discover something here I am in the	154.06336975097656
2741/3605	She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect cand	94.47029113769531
2742/3605	Alas said Milady I know it is	56.212894439697266
2743/3605	You would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent   The cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain	264.8944396972656
2744/3605	Permit me madame to express my surprise said the abb	156.64674377441406
2745/3605	At what said Milady with the utmost ingenuous	125.01712036132812
2746/3605	What do you find so astonishing in that language said Milady	209.27723693847656
2747/3605	You are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet   And yet I speak ill of him replied Milady finishing the thought of the	95.52528381347656
2748/3605	At least you dont speak well of	521.8150634765625
2749/3605	Ah said Milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether	117.21456146240234
2750/3605	Then said the abbess looking at Milady with increasing interest I behold another poor victim   Alas yes said Mil	278.94903564453125
2751/3605	The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her	99.37071228027344
2752/3605	You are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitating	94.87709045410156
2753/3605	You will find here moreover the young woman of whom I spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court	228.56582641601562
2754/3605	What is her name   She was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of	58.818458557128906
2755/3605	I have not tried to discover her other	85.57533264160156
2756/3605	What Are you sure   That she is called so Yes mad	43.873619079589844
2757/3605	Do you know her   Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chamber	63.859344482421875
2758/3605	There was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of Milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to	148.00164794921875
2759/3605	And when can I see this young lady for whom I already feel so great a sympathy asked Mil	170.00299072265625
2760/3605	Why this evening said the abbess today	390.1501770019531
2761/3605	But you have been traveling these four days as you told me	121.55593872070312
2762/3605	This morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of rep	118.46620178222656
2763/3605	Go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse	215.28341674804688
2764/3605	Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the	458.14068603515625
2765/3605	During the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required rep	289.13824462890625
2766/3605	She therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought to her	175.14205932617188
2767/3605	She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her	208.47813415527344
2768/3605	All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady so rocked by them she soon fell	633.5321044921875
2769/3605	She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her	54.38091278076172
2770/3605	She opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent	112.04795837402344
2771/3605	The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to	36.68973922729492
2772/3605	Each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of	921.3631591796875
2773/3605	Milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic	487.7693786621094
2774/3605	It is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this	183.16751098632812
2775/3605	The abbess introduced them to each	370.2861633300781
2776/3605	When this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women	285.1659851074219
2777/3605	The novice seeing Milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but Milady stopped	232.5016632080078
2778/3605	Well said Milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening This awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bed	184.2033233642578
2779/3605	How unfortunate I am said she I have been here six months without the shadow of	129.7535400390625
2780/3605	You arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet I expect in all probability to quit the convent at any	303.2947082519531
2781/3605	How you are going soon asked Mil	294.2870178222656
2782/3605	At least I hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to	77.05916595458984
2783/3605	I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued Milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between	142.978271484375
2784/3605	What I have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked	177.47811889648438
2785/3605	Hush said Milady let us not even here speak thus of	350.27362060546875
2786/3605	All my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom I thought my friend and who betrayed	78.95829772949219
2787/3605	Are you also the victim of a treachery   No said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman I loved for whom I would have laid down my life for whom I would give it	96.60325622558594
2788/3605	But you madame you appear to be free continued the novice and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do	119.42609405517578
2789/3605	Hear me said the novice we must trust in	848.3524780273438
2790/3605	Oh when I said I was alone said Milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the	273.3609619140625
2791/3605	The queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible	146.60214233398438
2792/3605	I have proof that her Majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons who had served	236.28500366210938
2793/3605	Trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in	163.2975311279297
2794/3605	The more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind	412.8351745605469
2795/3605	Alas said Milady I believe so the queen is so good   Oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with	164.30714416503906
2796/3605	That is to say replied Milady driven into her entrenchment that I have not the honor of knowing her personally but I know a great number of her most intimate	103.16239166259766
2797/3605	I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange I met Monsieur Dujart in England I know Monsieur de Tré	88.12850189208984
2798/3605	Monsieur de Tréville exclaimed the novice do you know Monsieur de Tréville   Yes perfectly wellintimately	67.17118835449219
2799/3605	The captain of the kings Musketeers   The captain of the kings Musket	28.731342315673828
2800/3605	Why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost	647.3619995117188
2801/3605	If you know Monsieur de Tréville you must have visited him   Often said Milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the	75.67501068115234
2802/3605	With him then you must have seen some of his Musketeers   All those he is in the habit of receiving replied Milady for whom this conversation began to have a real	102.48548889160156
2803/3605	Name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my	43.940773010253906
2804/3605	Well said Milady embarrassed I know Monsieur de Louvigny Monsieur de Courtivron Monsieur de Feruss	196.72512817382812
2805/3605	What is the matter Good God asked the poor woman have I said anything that has wounded you   No but the name struck me because I also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him	93.11026000976562
2806/3605	Oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends Messieurs Porthos and Aramis   Indeed you know them likewise I know them cried Milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her	129.17208862304688
2807/3605	Well if you know them you know that they are good and free	68.28597259521484
2808/3605	Why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help   That is to say stammered Milady I am not really very intimate with any of	44.421817779541016
2809/3605	I know them from having heard one of their friends Monsieur dArtagnan say a great deal about	32.67218780517578
2810/3605	You know Monsieur dArtagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her	47.27594757080078
2811/3605	Then remarking the strange expression of Miladys countenance she said Pardon me madame you know him by what title   Why replied Milady embarrassed why by the title of	103.66522216796875
2812/3605	You deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress   It is you who have been his mistress madame cried Milady in her	71.75330352783203
2813/3605	You are Madame Bonacieux   The young woman drew back filled with surprise and	84.35155487060547
2814/3605	Oh do not deny it Answer continued Mil	576.1195678710938
2815/3605	Well yes madame said the novice Are we rivals   The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances M	291.9635925292969
2816/3605	Bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by	183.0917205810547
2817/3605	Bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed	94.70663452148438
2818/3605	Have you been or are you his mistress   Oh no cried Milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her	140.31683349609375
2819/3605	Never never   I believe you said M	205.33840942382812
2820/3605	Bonacieux but why then did you cry out so   Do you not understand said Milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of	105.97283172607422
2821/3605	How can I understand I know	94.8224105834961
2822/3605	Can you not understand that Monsieur dArtagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence   Truly   Do you not perceive that I know allyour abduction from the little house at	89.92373657226562
2823/3605	Bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted	154.7869873046875
2824/3605	Oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of Mil	165.44302368164062
2825/3605	Pardon me I love him so much   These two women held each other for an instant in a close	89.39636993408203
2826/3605	Certainly if Miladys strength had been equal to her hatred M	546.0494384765625
2827/3605	Bonacieux would never have left that embrace	808.5491333007812
2828/3605	But not being able to stifle her she smiled upon	55.3690071105957
2829/3605	Oh you beautiful good little creature said Mil	1368.6427001953125
2830/3605	How delighted I am to have found you Let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her	150.40545654296875
2831/3605	Oh yes it is you indeed From what he has told me I know you	94.35450744628906
2832/3605	The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and	286.78515625
2833/3605	Then you know what I have suffered said M	147.23489379882812
2834/3605	Bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is	93.18883514404297
2835/3605	Milady replied mechanically Yes that is	3457.242919921875
2836/3605	Bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a	460.6376647949219
2837/3605	Tomorrow this evening perhaps I shall see him again and then the past will no longer	45.49907684326172
2838/3605	This evening asked Milady roused from her reverie by these	217.5013427734375
2839/3605	What do you mean Do you expect news from him   I expect	62.16482162475586
2840/3605	Himself DArtagnan here   Himself   But thats impossible He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the	81.14381408691406
2841/3605	He will not return till after the taking of the	100.06205749511719
2842/3605	Ah you fancy so But is there anything impossible for my DArtagnan the noble and loyal gentleman   Oh I cannot believe you   Well read then said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to Mil	92.23324584960938
2843/3605	The writing of Madame de Chevreuse said Milady to	67.19774627685547
2844/3605	Ah I always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter And she greedily read the following few lines   MY DEAR CHILD Hold yourself	1400.23486328125
2845/3605	_Our friend_ will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be	386.6485595703125
2846/3605	Prepare then for your departure and never despair of	368.5082092285156
2847/3605	Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful     as	493.9341125488281
2848/3605	Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning     he has	564.4674682617188
2849/3605	Yes yes said Milady the letter is	240.4512176513672
2850/3605	Do you know what that warning was   No I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the	233.42189025878906
2851/3605	Yes thats it no doubt said Milady returning the letter to M	373.8996276855469
2852/3605	Bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bos	144.18325805664062
2853/3605	At that moment they heard the gallop of a	46.62254333496094
2854/3605	Bonacieux darting to the window can it be he   Milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a	108.47685241699219
2855/3605	He he murmured she can it be he And she remained in bed with her eyes	76.89457702636719
2856/3605	Bonacieux it is a man I dont know although he seems to be coming	68.17489624023438

2872/3605	Milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the	86.11512756347656
2873/3605	An instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man	68.75420379638672
2874/3605	Milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the Comte de Rochefortthe demoniacal tool of his Emin	251.43319702148438

2878/3605	Ah said Rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chanceone that will delight his Eminence Have you informed him of it   I wrote to him from Boulog	52.56822967529297
2879/3605	But what brings you here   His Eminence was uneasy and sent me to find	51.799922943115234
2880/3605	And what have you been doing since yesterday   I have not lost my	25.4716796875

2884/3605	Then she looks upon you as a stranger   Milady	81.95359802246094
2885/3605	Upon my honor said Rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles   And it is well I can Chevalier said Milady for do you know what is going on here  	63.278873443603516

2888/3605	Indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the Bast	39.73194122314453
2889/3605	Why is it not done already   What would you The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I cannot	126.14390563964844
2890/3605	The devil Whats to be done   What did the cardinal say about me   I was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to	111.41603088378906
2891/3605	I must then remain here   Here or in the	58.69403839111328
2892/3605	You cannot take me with you   No the order is	115.88753509521484
2893/3605	Near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the	173.20059204101562
2894/3605	Then I must wait here or in the neighborhood   Only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find	116.23641967773438
2895/3605	Observe it is probable that I may not be able to remain	35.49158477783203

2909/3605	To what purpose   I am a victim of the	38.322532653808594
2910/3605	It is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little Madame Bonacie	217.92698669433594
2911/3605	Now will you make me a report of all that has happened   Why I have related the events to	49.20228576660156

2920/3605	I will leave him at the place I quit and he will conduct you to	39.81172180175781
2921/3605	And you say you will wait for me at Armentières   At Armentiè	44.17339324951172
2922/3605	Write that name on a bit of paper lest I should forget	104.7083969116211
2923/3605	There is nothing compromising in the name of a	181.43087768554688
2924/3605	Is it not so   Eh who knows Never mind said Milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper I will compromise	282.5664367675781
2925/3605	Well said Rochefort taking the paper from Milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be	108.51358795166016

2932/3605	What   To ask me if I want	31.67101287841797
2933/3605	How much do you want   All you have in	80.19754028320312
2934/3605	I have five hundred pistoles or there	71.30257415771484

2936/3605	And you go   In an hourtime to eat a morsel during which I shall send for a post	123.25028228759766
2937/3605	Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and	307.4945983886719
2938/3605	An hour afterward Rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through Ar	189.37615966796875
2939/3605	Our readers already know how he was recognized by DArtagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given fresh activity to their	257.68780517578125
2940/3605	THE DROP OF WATER     Rochefort had scarcely departed when M	5597.490234375
2941/3605	She found Milady with a smiling count	326.2090759277344
2942/3605	Well said the young woman what you dreaded has	80.10856628417969
2943/3605	This evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you	137.78538513183594
2944/3605	Who told you that my dear asked Mil	114.79548645019531
2945/3605	I heard it from the mouth of the messenger	45.22323989868164
2946/3605	Come and sit down close to me said Mil	102.31892395019531
2947/3605	Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears	475.1545104980469
2948/3605	Why all these precautions   You shall	45.445587158203125
2949/3605	Milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to M	173.91156005859375
2950/3605	Then said she he has well played his	435.36395263671875
2951/3605	Who has   He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the	99.89376831054688
2952/3605	It was then a part he was playing   Yes my	80.58993530273438
2953/3605	That man then was not   That man said Milady lowering her voice is my	98.28829193115234
2954/3605	No one must know this secret my dear but	286.1648254394531
2955/3605	If you reveal it to anyone in the world I shall be lost and perhaps yourself	205.5490264892578
2956/3605	This is what has happened My brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of	63.44068908691406
2957/3605	At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the	92.43806457519531
2958/3605	The messenger resisted my brother killed	1355.7816162109375
2959/3605	Then my brother determined to substitute cunning for	3807.60546875
2960/3605	He took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his Emin	45.1671142578125
2961/3605	It is your brother who sends this	136.0142059326172
2962/3605	That letter you have received and which you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse   Well   It is a for	36.16756057739258
2963/3605	How can that be   Yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch	97.0522232055664
2964/3605	But it is DArtagnan that will	27.253084182739258
2965/3605	DArtagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of La Roc	25.63346290588379
2966/3605	How do you know that   My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of Musket	51.04963684082031
2967/3605	You would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to	132.8756561279297
2968/3605	Oh my God My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniqu	4466.22021484375
2969/3605	I feel if this continues said M	793.3411865234375
2970/3605	Bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead I shall go mad   Stop   What   I hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off	149.83909606933594
2971/3605	I should like to offer him a last	71.93006896972656
2972/3605	Come   Milady opened the window and made a sign to M	41.38911819458008
2973/3605	The chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to Mil	82.757568359375
2974/3605	The good George said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and	74.9255142211914
2975/3605	And she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely	1035.143798828125
2976/3605	Bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do Good heaven You have more experience than I	134.9147491455078
2977/3605	In the first place said Milady it is possible I may be deceived and that DArtagnan and his friends may really come to your	48.38613510131836
2978/3605	Oh that would be too much cried M	224.09922790527344
2979/3605	Bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me   Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive	72.40398406982422
2980/3605	If your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are	124.65318298339844
2981/3605	Oh yes yes lost beyond redemption What then to do What to do   There would be a very simple means very natural   Tell me what   To wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for	107.50054931640625
2982/3605	But where can I wait   Oh there is no difficulty in	42.57695770263672
2983/3605	I shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin	238.1903533935547
2984/3605	Well I take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait	221.57838439941406
2985/3605	But I shall not be allowed to go I am almost a	39.73250961303711
2986/3605	As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow	103.625732421875
2987/3605	But DArtagnan DArtagnan if he comes   Shall we not know it   How   Nothing	21.24117660522461
2988/3605	We will send my brothers servant back to Béthune whom as I told you we can	626.828125
2989/3605	He shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the	161.25137329101562
2990/3605	If the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is Monsieur dArtagnan and his friends he will bring them to	28.695236206054688
2991/3605	He knows them then   Doubt	31.47126007080078
2992/3605	Has he not seen Monsieur dArtagnan at my house   Oh yes yes you are	18.425739288330078
2993/3605	Thus all may go wellall may be for the best but we do not go far from this place   Seven or eight leagues at the	96.21236419677734
2994/3605	We will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave	90.70903778076172
2995/3605	And what can we do there  	37.771148681640625
2996/3605	But if they come   My brothers carriage will be here	79.88751220703125
2997/3605	If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for youat dinner or supper for instance   Do one	140.87017822265625
2998/3605	What is that   Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my rep	138.83262634277344
2999/3605	Will she permit it   What inconvenience can it be   Oh delightful In this way we shall not be separated for an	111.0972900390625
3000/3605	Well go down to her then to make your	110.97398376464844
3001/3605	I feel my head a little confused I will take a turn in the	68.42700958251953
3002/3605	Go and where shall I find you   Here in an	32.18785858154297
3003/3605	Now then all is agreed let us go	140.21791076660156
3004/3605	You are going into the garden  	31.971105575561523
3005/3605	Go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in	92.96031188964844
3006/3605	Excellent thank you   And the two women parted exchanging charming	261.0564880371094
3007/3605	Milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed one another like	5078.50439453125
3008/3605	She required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into	161.2845916748047
3009/3605	She saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular	405.17236328125
3010/3605	What was most pressing was to get M	1870.42822265625
3011/3605	Bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a	428.5094299316406
3012/3605	Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did	296.86328125
3013/3605	Besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near and could not fail to be	179.78778076171875
3014/3605	The principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep M	291.85040283203125
3015/3605	Bonacieux was the very life of DArtagn	28.995193481445312
3016/3605	This was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good	224.25025939941406
3017/3605	Once concealed with her at Armentières it would be easy to make her believe that DArtagnan had not come to Béth	118.92459106445312
3018/3605	In fifteen days at most Rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four	166.47232055664062
3019/3605	She would not be weary thank God for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her characterperfecting a beautiful	431.86370849609375
3020/3605	Revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her	104.67919158935547
3021/3605	Milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a	250.51422119140625
3022/3605	At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was M	174.88394165039062
3023/3605	The good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup	375.325439453125
3024/3605	On reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the	32.405941009521484
3025/3605	It is the one my brother sends for	249.055419921875
3026/3605	Oh my God   Come come courage   The bell of the convent gate was sounded Milady was not	239.78631591796875
3027/3605	Go to your chamber said she to M	405.91259765625
3028/3605	Bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to	146.05091857910156

3030/3605	We will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength	336.1138916015625
3031/3605	Bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so I cannot	165.63673400878906
3032/3605	Courage courage remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for _his_	73.97147369384766
3033/3605	You have restored my courage by a single word go I will rejoin	137.86175537109375
3034/3605	Milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found Rocheforts lackey and gave him his	280.1966857910156
3035/3605	He was to wait at the gate if by chance the Musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the	63.876007080078125
3036/3605	In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on	216.05462646484375
3037/3605	As we have already said Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of	60.352542877197266
3038/3605	If the Musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed M	347.0137023925781
3039/3605	Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away M	95.67357635498047
3040/3605	Bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any Milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her	167.33216857910156
3041/3605	Milady asked some questions about the	987.8875732421875
3042/3605	It was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion Rocheforts lackey would precede it as	1055.730712890625
3043/3605	Milady was wrong in fearing that M	2040.463134765625
3044/3605	You see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is	141.20436096191406
3045/3605	The abbess suspects nothing and believes that I am taken by order of the	463.6186828613281
3046/3605	This man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be	249.09898376464844
3047/3605	Bonacieux mechanically yes let us be	306.3157958984375
3048/3605	Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of Spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a	134.1605682373047
3049/3605	See said she if everything does not second us Here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we	206.2250518798828
3050/3605	Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her	174.1416778564453
3051/3605	Come come said Milady lifting hers to her mouth do as I	387.5079345703125
3052/3605	But at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gall	105.17813110351562
3053/3605	Then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of	53.215030670166016
3054/3605	This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while M	232.73126220703125
3055/3605	Bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid	406.2677307128906
3056/3605	Nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw	143.80828857421875
3057/3605	Bonacieux what is that noise   That of either our friends or our enemies said Milady with her terrible cool	85.63725280761719
3058/3605	Stay where you are I will tell	29.822872161865234
3059/3605	Bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a	83.78093719482422
3060/3605	The noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces	42.26073455810547
3061/3605	If they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an	122.7878646850586
3062/3605	The noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoof	112.82610321044922
3063/3605	Milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was	131.02943420410156
3064/3605	All at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horse	403.96221923828125
3065/3605	One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his	151.26048278808594
3066/3605	In the first horseman she recognized DArtagn	46.639183044433594
3067/3605	Oh my God my God cried M	435.5815734863281
3068/3605	Bonacieux what is it   It is the uniform of the cardinals	65.03337097167969
3069/3605	Not an instant to be lost Fly fly   Yes yes let us fly repeated M	485.6590270996094
3070/3605	Bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by	135.50686645507812
3071/3605	They heard the horsemen pass under the	198.9154052734375
3072/3605	Come then come then cried Milady trying to drag the young woman along by the	171.6939239501953
3073/3605	Thanks to the garden we yet can flee I have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late   M	110.23298645019531
3074/3605	Bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her	290.0151672363281
3075/3605	Milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do	328.1471862792969
3076/3605	At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the Musketeers set off at a gall	24.178956985473633
3077/3605	Then three or four shots were	13.846110343933105
3078/3605	For the last time will you come cried Mil	488.9507141113281
3079/3605	Oh my God my God you see my strength fails me you see plainly I cannot	128.81883239746094
3080/3605	Flee alone   Flee alone and leave you here No no never cried Mil	421.95111083984375
3081/3605	All at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into M	283.47967529296875
3082/3605	Bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quick	216.6411895751953
3083/3605	It was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved	276.32501220703125
3084/3605	Then taking the glass with a firm hand she said	170.9735870361328
3085/3605	This wine will give you strength drink And she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank	127.38800811767578
3086/3605	This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself said Milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith we do what we can And she rushed out of the	78.97113800048828
3087/3605	Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to	156.51974487304688
3088/3605	A few moments passed a great noise was heard at the	99.34706115722656
3089/3605	Bonacieux expected to see Milady but she did not	89.60643005371094
3090/3605	Several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning	176.74497985839844
3091/3605	At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the	103.59198760986328
3092/3605	There was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name	144.2430877685547
3093/3605	All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of DArtagn	18.01047134399414
3094/3605	Bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of	124.03612518310547
3095/3605	DArtagnan threw down a yetsmoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his	131.21388244628906
3096/3605	Athos replaced his in his belt Porthos and Aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabb	64.00115966796875

3099/3605	Oh I have done well How happy I am   At this word _she_ Athos who had seated himself quietly started	101.65898895263672
3100/3605	She who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecut	127.07308197021484
3101/3605	She who mistaking you for the cardinals Guards has just fled	794.0798950195312
3102/3605	Your companion cried DArtagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his	66.82781219482422
3103/3605	Of what companion are you speaking dear Constance   Of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend of a woman to whom you have told	149.40879821777344
3104/3605	My God can you not remember her name   Yes it was pronounced in my hearing	128.74147033691406
3105/3605	Stopbutit is very strangeoh my God my head swims I cannot see   Help help my friends her hands are icy cold cried DArtagn	207.52056884765625
3106/3605	Oh said Athos oh no it is impossible God would not permit such a crime   Water water cried DArtagn	69.08517456054688
3107/3605	Water   Oh poor woman poor woman murmured Athos in a broken	78.67279052734375
3108/3605	Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of DArtagn	45.0537109375
3109/3605	Oh my God my God I thank thee   Madame said Athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this   Mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying	47.412784576416016
3110/3605	But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass  	127.1402359008789
3111/3605	But who is _she_   Oh I remember said M	126.06080627441406
3112/3605	The four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of Athos dominated all the	205.21310424804688
3113/3605	At that moment the countenance of M	232.98977661132812
3114/3605	Bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos and Aram	59.2833366394043
3115/3605	DArtagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be	60.8492431640625
3116/3605	And what do you believe His voice was stifled by so	105.01656341552734
3117/3605	I believe everything said Athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sigh	103.66260528564453
3118/3605	Bonacieux where art thou Do not leave me You see I am dying   DArtagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to	53.2678108215332
3119/3605	Her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her	357.97003173828125
3120/3605	In the name of heaven run call Aramis Porthos Call for help   Useless said Athos useless For the poison which _she_ pours there is no	300.0110168457031
3121/3605	Bonacieux help   Then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to	59.84727478027344
3122/3605	A sigh escaped from the mouth of M	272.4358825683594
3123/3605	Bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of DArtagn	31.401750564575195
3124/3605	That sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to	1256.421142578125
3125/3605	DArtagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his	44.72752380371094
3126/3605	The young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as	72.66677856445312
3127/3605	Porthos wept Aramis pointed toward heaven Athos made the sign of the	90.15257263183594
3128/3605	At that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the	94.67710876464844
3129/3605	He looked around him and saw M	166.9723663330078
3130/3605	Bonacieux dead and DArtagnan in a sw	46.914852142333984
3131/3605	He appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrop	83.90927124023438
3132/3605	I was not deceived said he here is Monsieur dArtagnan and you are his friends Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aram	17.938352584838867
3133/3605	The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with aston	76.83234405517578
3134/3605	It seemed to all three that they knew	146.17300415039062
3135/3605	Gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as I am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for I see a	107.09196472167969
3136/3605	The three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what	231.87245178222656
3137/3605	Gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice I must name	227.7474822998047
3138/3605	I am Lord de Winter brotherinlaw of that _woman	157.1629180908203
3139/3605	The three friends uttered a cry of	17.32891082763672
3140/3605	Athos rose and offering him his hand Be welcome my Lord said he you are one of	149.70281982421875
3141/3605	I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth said Lord de	253.57322692871094
3142/3605	I arrived three hours after her at Boulog	42.506465911865234
3143/3605	I missed her by twenty minutes at	500.6850280761719
3144/3605	Finally at Lilliers I lost all trace of	479.82177734375
3145/3605	I was going about at random inquiring of everybody when I saw you gallop	226.11094665527344
3146/3605	I called to you but you did not answer me I wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with	52.02614974975586
3147/3605	And yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too	99.2776870727539
3148/3605	You see said Athos pointing to M	212.15536499023438
3149/3605	Bonacieux dead and to DArtagnan whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to	34.90031814575195
3150/3605	Are they both dead asked Lord de Winter stern	187.521484375
3151/3605	No replied Athos fortunately Monsieur dArtagnan has only f	25.71527862548828
3152/3605	Ah indeed so much the better said Lord de	37.79273986816406
3153/3605	At that moment DArtagnan opened his	21.469600677490234
3154/3605	He tore himself from the arms of Porthos and Aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his	30.397563934326172
3155/3605	Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis to go and fetch the	43.33327865600586
3156/3605	The two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five	503.8653869628906
3157/3605	Madame said Athos passing his arm under that of DArtagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate	96.89564514160156
3158/3605	She was an angel on earth before being an angel in	239.0662841796875
3159/3605	Treat her as one of your	624.1947021484375
3160/3605	We will return someday to pray over her	5814.4990234375
3161/3605	DArtagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos and sobbed	26.156587600708008
3162/3605	Weep said Athos weep heart full of love youth and life Alas would I could weep like you   And he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered	226.36444091796875
3163/3605	All five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of Béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came	272.9474182128906
3164/3605	But said DArtagnan shall we not pursue that woman   Later said Ath	45.7568473815918
3165/3605	She will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault Ath	45.349708557128906
3166/3605	I will be accountable for her said Ath	66.57038879394531
3167/3605	DArtagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without	39.171817779541016
3168/3605	Porthos and Aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of Ath	51.58565139770508
3169/3605	Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of DArtagn	67.30712890625
3170/3605	Now gentlemen said Athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own	215.09913635253906
3171/3605	DArtagnan needs to be alone to weep and to	72.66484069824219
3172/3605	I take charge of everything be	245.07154846191406
3173/3605	It appears however said Lord de Winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sisterin	109.36935424804688
3174/3605	And me said Athos she is my wife   DArtagnan smiledfor he understood that Athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a	43.187408447265625
3175/3605	Porthos and Aramis looked at each other and grew	13.308979034423828
3176/3605	Lord de Winter thought Athos was	156.0709991455078
3177/3605	Now retire to your chambers said Athos and leave me to	155.10964965820312
3178/3605	You must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns	206.50294494628906
3179/3605	Only DArtagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that mans hat upon which is written the name of the village of   Ah said DArtagnan I comprehend that name written in her	47.94682693481445
3180/3605	THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK     The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary	3940.43017578125
3181/3605	Planchet Grimaud Bazin and Mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from Ath	111.28089904785156
3182/3605	They must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to Armentièreseach by a different	183.2165069580078
3183/3605	Planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by Rocheforts	88.25617980957031
3184/3605	Athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential	157.3854217529297

3186/3605	Besides Milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew Milady	178.34613037109375

3189/3605	Athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hô	59.45027542114258
3190/3605	At ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequ	125.80462646484375
3191/3605	Athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a	119.13385772705078
3192/3605	At length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to	191.16641235351562
3193/3605	The man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the Musketeer by	112.70947265625
3194/3605	Athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man	155.41607666015625
3195/3605	Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly	354.8166198730469
3196/3605	Nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood	255.8162384033203
3197/3605	In a few minutes a night watch	178.103515625
3198/3605	Athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he	114.7492904663086
3199/3605	The night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany Athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to	121.71131134033203
3200/3605	Athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered	80.42183685302734
3201/3605	There he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third	117.6355209350586
3202/3605	Fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to Athos to ask charity Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was	130.37353515625
3203/3605	The mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before Ath	46.182884216308594
3204/3605	Arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and	123.0781478881836
3205/3605	Athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry	72.4938735961914
3206/3605	Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was	69.34121704101562
3207/3605	No light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was	122.85059356689453
3208/3605	It was dark and silent as the	57.540977478027344
3209/3605	Three times Athos knocked without receiving an	350.6277160644531
3210/3605	At the third knock however steps were heard	1309.361328125
3211/3605	The door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and	77.69824981689453
3212/3605	Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come	26.48040771484375
3213/3605	Athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind	42.54423141479492
3214/3605	The man whom Athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a	117.77819061279297
3215/3605	All the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the	197.63279724121094
3216/3605	All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural	157.93783569335938
3217/3605	There was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this	1005.9994506835938
3218/3605	Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near	123.17619323730469
3219/3605	Then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of	50.96873474121094
3220/3605	But scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the Musketeer drew back with signs of terror and	132.15513610839844
3221/3605	Then Athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repug	86.39761352539062
3222/3605	The tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to	82.99345397949219
3223/3605	He arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the hôtel and went to his	129.78558349609375
3224/3605	At daybreak DArtagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be	27.303733825683594
3225/3605	Some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the Musketeers that the burial would take place at	240.873291015625
3226/3605	As to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found	84.96814727783203
3227/3605	As to the key it had	73.68585968017578
3228/3605	At the hour appointed Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was	184.80764770507812
3229/3605	In the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was	459.21697998046875
3230/3605	At the door of the chapel DArtagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for Athos but Athos had	99.04425048828125
3231/3605	Then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the	97.15139770507812
3232/3605	Athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the	139.85952758789062
3233/3605	At the end of threequarters of a league within fifty paces of Festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by	325.2917175292969
3234/3605	Between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden the carriage had stopped	190.5186767578125
3235/3605	At this spot Milady had come out of the wood and entered the	56.62873840332031
3236/3605	Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions Athos returned to the hôtel and found Planchet impatiently waiting for	93.63920593261719
3237/3605	Planchet had followed the road like Athos he had discovered the stains of blood like Athos he had noted the spot where the horses had	72.75110626220703
3238/3605	The accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the	377.2377624511719
3239/3605	The man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her	490.1473083496094

3242/3605	Planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at Armentiè	22.10713768005371
3243/3605	There was but one tavern the	2909.485107421875
3244/3605	Planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a	39.68199920654297
3245/3605	Planchet had no need to learn	23.62141990661621
3246/3605	He hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find Athos who had just received this information when his friends	109.63670349121094
3247/3605	All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of Aram	217.50840759277344
3248/3605	What is to be done asked DArtagn	10.904376029968262
3249/3605	At eight oclock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the	65.4880142211914
3250/3605	In an instant all five were	453.7604675292969
3251/3605	Each examined his arms and put them in	107.29627227783203
3252/3605	Athos came down last and found DArtagnan already on horseback and growing	84.53778839111328
3253/3605	Patience cried Athos one of our party is still	98.00917053222656
3254/3605	The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could	120.95053100585938
3255/3605	At this moment Planchet brought out Athoss horse the Musketeer leaped lightly into the	55.63431930541992
3256/3605	Wait for me cried he I will soon be back and he set off at a gall	43.210880279541016
3257/3605	In a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red	50.535274505615234
3258/3605	Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another inquiring	62.73112869262695
3259/3605	Neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of Ath	131.37709045410156
3260/3605	At nine oclock guided by Planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had	213.05337524414062
3261/3605	It was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastis	996.018310546875
3262/3605	TRIAL     It was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till	198.37368774414062
3263/3605	Occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in	186.539306640625
3264/3605	Every minute Athos was forced to restrain DArtagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed	60.659950256347656
3265/3605	He had but one thoughtto go forward and he	743.4237060546875
3266/3605	They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of Riche	782.6475830078125
3267/3605	At Herlier Planchet who led the column turned to the	351.46649169921875
3268/3605	Several times Lord de Winter Porthos or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without	153.0886688232422
3269/3605	The travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to	153.26812744140625
3270/3605	The storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horse	572.7938232421875
3271/3605	A little before they came to Fromelles the storm	2016.341064453125
3272/3605	There remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of	1146.9520263671875
3273/3605	DArtagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his	18.60308074951172
3274/3605	He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudd	521.8685302734375
3275/3605	The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his	243.508544921875
3276/3605	Has she left Armentières   Grimaud made a sign in the	59.45756149291992
3277/3605	I have charged myself with this	84.00587463378906
3278/3605	It is for me then to interrogate Grim	102.13904571533203
3279/3605	Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the	133.79322814941406
3280/3605	Grimaud showed his master his forefinger	1769.8382568359375
3281/3605	Gentlemen said Athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the	105.8167495727539
3282/3605	Grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the caval	1427.322998046875
3283/3605	At the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they for	300.16656494140625
3284/3605	By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquin	804.5048217773438
3285/3605	Grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a	104.22620391845703
3286/3605	At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards	82.0134506225586
3287/3605	He pointed his finger to the lighted	322.584228515625
3288/3605	While I watched the window he guarded the	192.50457763671875
3289/3605	Athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to Grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the	24.834060668945312
3290/3605	The little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet	134.305419921875
3291/3605	Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the halfcurtains closely	86.99095153808594
3292/3605	He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the	552.7467041015625
3293/3605	By the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying	70.27610778808594
3294/3605	Her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as	295.9698181152344
3295/3605	He could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of Ath	27.644941329956055
3296/3605	He was not deceived it was she whom he	93.28628540039062

3298/3605	Athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and	90.26277923583984
3299/3605	The squares were broken to shivers and Athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the	177.20936584472656
3300/3605	Milady rushed to the door and opened	83.1678466796875
3301/3605	More pale and menacing than Athos DArtagnan stood on the	34.11082458496094
3302/3605	DArtagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but Athos raised his	102.92398834228516

3319/3605	And DArtagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aram	8.477158546447754
3320/3605	Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of	155.78883361816406

3370/3605	Milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her	119.98204040527344

3374/3605	At these words which left no hope Milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed	123.89006042480469
3375/3605	She felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags	308.06915283203125

3421/3605	I pardon you said he the ill you have done	95.43741607666016

3429/3605	Die in peace   I am lost murmured Milady in	87.07357788085938
3430/3605	I must die   Then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of	151.43606567382812
3431/3605	She saw nothing she listened and she heard	230.7602081298828
3432/3605	Where am I to die said	234.40052795410156
3433/3605	On the other bank replied the execution	205.18914794921875
3434/3605	Then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself Athos handed him a sum of	70.04165649414062
3435/3605	Here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as	181.84202575683594
3436/3605	That is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that I am not fulfilling my trade but my	173.34344482421875
3437/3605	And he threw the money into the	40.9283447265625
3438/3605	The boat moved off toward the lefthand shore of the Lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the righthand bank where they fell on their	125.57125091552734
3439/3605	The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that	83.81170654296875
3440/3605	The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the redtinted	842.8212280273438
3441/3605	Milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her	453.9097900390625
3442/3605	On coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to	225.9620819091797
3443/3605	But the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her	122.48787689208984
3444/3605	She was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasp	115.8475341796875
3445/3605	Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large	425.3945617675781
3446/3605	The two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the	270.0962219238281
3447/3605	The executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat	162.52467346191406
3448/3605	In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice Let the justice of God be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over	132.2151336669922

3451/3605	Prodigiously replied Athos in the name of himself and his	110.21170043945312
3452/3605	CONCLUSION     On the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of Buckinghams	174.5786590576172
3453/3605	arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the	137.73513793945312
3454/3605	The joy of the king was	435.9117431640625
3455/3605	He did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the	356.1728820800781
3456/3605	like every weak mind was wanting in	825.784912109375
3457/3605	But the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain	248.07994079589844
3458/3605	He felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did	1043.7412109375
3459/3605	The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to	1057.1099853515625
3460/3605	The return to La Rochelle therefore was profoundly	285.0179443359375
3461/3605	Our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads	751.6695556640625

3465/3605	DArtagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the	12.033326148986816
3466/3605	But this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet DArtagn	55.5848388671875

3483/3605	Rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a days journey from Surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with	166.89181518554688

3488/3605	On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied DArtagnan without his sword and the three Musketeers	173.6056671142578
3489/3605	This time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for DArtagnan to follow	51.691253662109375
3490/3605	We shall wait for you DArtagnan said Athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear	23.878280639648438

3494/3605	DArtagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with Richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his	65.77239227294922
3495/3605	Richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and DArtagn	53.250579833984375
