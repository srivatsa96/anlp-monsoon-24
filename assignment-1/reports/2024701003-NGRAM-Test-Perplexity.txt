1/3605	Nothing could turn him from his	340.9988708496094
2/3605	Honoré and in the Place du PalaisCardinal they found the twelve invited Musketeers walking about in expectation of their	1019.7909545898438
3/3605	There only they explained to them the matter in	325.3813781738281
4/3605	DArtagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings Musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a	131.23741149902344
5/3605	Athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to Aramis and the third to Porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an	262.09173583984375
6/3605	DArtagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal	139.2794647216797
7/3605	Although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by	126.4910888671875
8/3605	His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the	507.3643798828125
9/3605	Still further De Wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his Eminence and DArtagnan knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his	168.36695861816406
10/3605	If De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable I may consider myself almost as a condemned man said DArtagnan shaking his	124.01104736328125
11/3605	But why has he waited till now Thats all plain	1243.781005859375
12/3605	Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup	1378.4638671875
13/3605	Fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a	83.57038879394531
14/3605	Nevertheless Monsieur de Trévilles company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all France and before whom the queen is without power and the king without	223.2981414794922
15/3605	DArtagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you   He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antech	86.5450210571289
16/3605	He placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the	99.42972564697266
17/3605	In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards who recognized DArtagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded Jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular	188.06394958496094
18/3605	This smile appeared to DArtagnan to be of bad aug	115.01700592041016
19/3605	The usher returned and made a sign to DArtagnan to follow	30.38051414489746
20/3605	It appeared to the young man that the Guards on seeing him depart chuckled among	865.9170532226562
21/3605	He traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and	207.2407989501953
22/3605	The usher introduced him and retired without speaking a	392.01446533203125
23/3605	DArtagnan remained standing and examined this	34.85165023803711
24/3605	DArtagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his	487.4736022949219
25/3605	He saw then that he was with a	175.8802947998047
26/3605	At the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written Mirame a Tragedy in Five Acts and raised his	1191.2021484375
27/3605	A TERRIBLE VISION     The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a	589.8383178710938
28/3605	No one had a more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu and DArtagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a	101.5596694946289
29/3605	He however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence without too much assurance but also without too much	215.1904296875
30/3605	Monsieur said the cardinal are you a DArtagnan from Béarn   Yes monseigneur replied the young	49.71122360229492
31/3605	It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital   Yes monseign	65.1818618774414
32/3605	You came through Meung where something befell	2773.157958984375
33/3605	I dont very well know what but still	316.1708679199219
34/3605	Monseigneur said DArtagnan this was what happened to me   Never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate	42.66560745239258
35/3605	You were recommended to Monsieur de Tréville were you not   Yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at Meung   The letter was lost replied his Eminence yes I know	77.3526840209961
36/3605	Since that time many things have happened to	89.93746185302734
37/3605	You were walking one day behind the Chartreux when it would have been better if you had been	200.29815673828125
38/3605	Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of Forges they stopped on the road but you continued	262.39111328125
39/3605	That is all very simple you had business in	293.6041259765625
40/3605	Monseigneur said DArtagnan quite confused I went   Hunting at Windsor or elsewherethat concerns	1366.5115966796875
41/3605	I know because it is my office to know	116.22627258300781
42/3605	On your return you were received by an august personage and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave	325.4951171875
43/3605	DArtagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too	79.483642578125
44/3605	The day after that you received a visit from Cavois resumed the	773.6470947265625
45/3605	He went to desire you to come to the	110.9352035522461
46/3605	You have not returned that visit and you were	168.6649169921875
47/3605	Monseigneur I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Emin	676.4639282226562
48/3605	As a proof remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very	110.35147857666016
49/3605	That was the very evening when the abduction of M	535.1698608398438
50/3605	DArtagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her	108.29302215576172
51/3605	In short continued the cardinal as I have heard nothing of you for some time past I wished to know what you were	49.372474670410156
52/3605	You must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the	198.14755249023438
53/3605	That continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect to	336.91650390625
54/3605	I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation but you did not	115.76112365722656
55/3605	Fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear	83.2293701171875
56/3605	Sit down there before me DArtagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen	157.54429626464844
57/3605	And the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he ob	100.3675537109375
58/3605	You are brave Monsieur dArtagnan continued his Eminence you are prudent which is still	66.51647186279297
59/3605	I like men of head and	370.1265869140625
60/3605	By men of heart I mean men of	413.9398498535156
61/3605	But young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy	360.9867248535156
62/3605	Alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while I am	115.47724914550781
63/3605	Yes thats true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more I dont	215.9998016357422
64/3605	Yet you have need I believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if I mistake not you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your	138.383056640625
65/3605	I am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said DArtagn	31.124853134155273
66/3605	There are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of	196.49713134765625
67/3605	Now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my Guards and a company after the campaign   Ah monseign	300.2832336425781
68/3605	You accept it do you not   Monseigneur replied DArtagnan with an embarrassed	20.07718849182129
69/3605	How You refuse cried the cardinal with aston	98.75883483886719
70/3605	I am in his Majestys Guards monseigneur and I have no reason to be	293.658447265625
71/3605	But it appears to me that my Guardsmineare also his Majestys Guards and whoever serves in a French corps serves the	3749.882568359375
72/3605	Monseigneur your Eminence has ill understood my	805.842529296875
73/3605	You want a pretext do you not I	375.3453369140625
74/3605	Well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which I offer youso much for the	816.431640625
75/3605	As regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know Monsieur dArtagnan that I have received heavy and serious complaints against	166.15652465820312
76/3605	You do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings	1625.1112060546875
77/3605	In fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers I have here a whole pile which concerns	206.33030700683594
78/3605	I know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to	255.40110778808594
79/3605	Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of	100.53553771972656
80/3605	Monseigneur your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary I think I have not proved myself worthy of your	119.41544342041016
81/3605	The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed monseign	108.09857177734375
82/3605	I shall serve under the eye of your Eminence and if I have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor	153.87960815429688
83/3605	Everything is best in its time monseign	94.47241973876953
84/3605	Hereafter perhaps I shall have the right of _giving_ myself at present I shall appear to sell	238.71304321289062
85/3605	That is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympath	128.85675048828125
86/3605	Monseigneur   Well well said the cardinal I dont wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our	62.10097885131836
87/3605	We owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself Monsieur dArtagnan for from the moment I withdraw my hand from behind you I would not give an _obolus_ for your	106.46875
88/3605	I will try to do so monseigneur replied the Gascon with a noble	40.33549118041992
89/3605	Remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said Richelieu significantly that it was I who came to seek you and that I did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling	151.1714324951172
90/3605	I shall entertain whatever may happen said DArtagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your Eminence for that which you now do for	110.2115478515625
91/3605	Well let it be then as you have said Monsieur dArtagnan we shall see each other again after the	26.883930206298828
92/3605	Remain neutral monseigneur if you find that I act as becomes a gallant	289.5538024902344
93/3605	Young man said Richelieu if I shall be able to say to you at another time what I have said to you today I promise you to do	39.921363830566406
94/3605	This last expression of Richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed DArtagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a	208.4253692626953
95/3605	The cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened	433.7104797363281
96/3605	He opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed	114.8938980102539
97/3605	DArtagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to	47.82066345214844
98/3605	Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required Athos would no more give him his handAthos would renounce	225.532470703125
99/3605	It was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds	397.1039733886719
100/3605	DArtagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow	106.58151245117188
101/3605	With a word DArtagnan reassured them and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the PalaisCard	226.13412475585938
102/3605	Returned home with Athos Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but DArtagnan confined himself to telling them that	162.09799194335938
103/3605	de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had	74.40091705322266
104/3605	And you were right cried Aramis and Porthos with one	44.22487258911133
105/3605	Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered	235.77157592773438
106/3605	But when they were alone he said You have done that which you ought to have done DArtagnan but perhaps you have been	45.486820220947266
107/3605	DArtagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited	77.97502136230469
108/3605	The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for	158.59356689453125
109/3605	DArtagnan went to take leave of	20.97772789001465
110/3605	At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day	316.661376953125
111/3605	de Tréville contented himself with asking DArtagnan if he could do anything for him but DArtagnan answered that he was supplied with all he	50.75986099243164
112/3605	That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of	2003.62646484375
113/3605	Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of	445.77142333984375
114/3605	de Tréville who had been accustomed to associate	149.96646118164062
115/3605	They were parting to meet again when it pleased God and if it pleased	420.84075927734375
116/3605	That night then was somewhat riotous as may be	871.7286987304688
117/3605	In such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme care	554.1116333007812
118/3605	At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the Musketeers hastening to the hôtel of	227.19451904296875
119/3605	de Tréville the Guards to that of	458.1039733886719
120/3605	Each of the captains then led his company to the Louvre where the king held his	147.94068908691406
121/3605	The king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty	1080.0335693359375

123/3605	He had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon	327.3119201660156
124/3605	The review over the Guards set forward alone on their march the Musketeers waiting for the king which allowed Porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux O	609.6181030273438
125/3605	The procurators wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine	727.5516357421875
126/3605	She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus she made him a sign to dismount and come to	125.99620056152344
127/3605	Porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample	609.8330078125

129/3605	Coquenard whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing	882.9830932617188
130/3605	Nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe	454.5619812011719
131/3605	He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the	375.4586486816406

133/3605	Coquenard she could not restrain her tears but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her	369.3212585449219
134/3605	But the real adieux were made in M	1264.5340576171875
135/3605	As long as the procurators wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate	208.95574951171875
136/3605	Porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of ad	154.41705322265625
137/3605	On his part Aramis wrote a long	375.2617492675781
138/3605	Kitty who was to set out that evening for Tours was waiting in the next	312.0708923339844

145/3605	THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE     The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis	3283.422607421875
146/3605	and one of the great military enterprises of the	144.13905334472656
147/3605	It is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in	281.6435241699219
148/3605	The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were	1748.6185302734375
149/3605	Let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the	564.1318969726562
150/3605	Of the important cities given up by Henry	741.89208984375
151/3605	to the Huguenots as places of safety there only remained La Roc	3645.323974609375

153/3605	Spaniards Englishmen and Italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of	2326.39501953125
154/3605	La Rochelle which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities was then the focus of dissensions and	1207.63232421875
155/3605	Moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English and by closing it against England our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Gu	445.3569030761719
156/3605	The cannonade of the Isle of Ré presaged to him the dragonnades of the Cévennes the taking of La Rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the Edict of N	1674.54833984375

160/3605	On his side Buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of England was moved by interests exactly like those of the	396.4637145996094
161/3605	Buckingham also was pursuing a private	10196.8056640625
162/3605	Buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador he wished to enter it as a conquer	430.1176452636719
163/3605	It resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from Anne of	586.400146484375
164/3605	The first advantage had been gained by	727.8549194335938

166/3605	Allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de Chantal that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward M	1116.890625
167/3605	The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel	2577.520751953125

169/3605	It was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend DArtagnan formed a	309.28668212890625
170/3605	The king as we have said was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice had been held but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the twentyeighth of June he felt himself attacked by	566.52294921875
171/3605	He was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at Viller	196.94241333007812
172/3605	Now whenever the king halted the Musketeers	476.90728759765625
173/3605	It followed that DArtagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friendsAthos Porthos and Aram	123.16756439208984
174/3605	This separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was	183.4158172607422
175/3605	He however arrived without accident in the camp established before La Rochelle on the tenth of the month of September of the year 16	237.84780883789062

179/3605	Dessessart took up their quarters at the Minimes but as we know DArtagnan possessed with ambition to enter the Musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own	484.6622009277344
180/3605	From the time of his arrival in Paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or	141.93679809570312
181/3605	As to love the only woman he could have loved was M	1126.248046875
182/3605	Bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of	66.40792846679688
183/3605	As to fortune he had madehe humble as he wasan enemy of the cardinal that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the	211.817138671875
184/3605	That man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done	76.93936157226562
185/3605	For a mind so perspicuous as that of DArtagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better	183.731201171875
186/3605	Then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be	375.29718017578125
187/3605	In exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badlyas witness Chalais and M	353.05047607421875
188/3605	We say the gravel he trod under his feet for DArtagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of Angout	715.5431518554688
189/3605	Now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a	122.37461853027344
190/3605	DArtagnan had a quick eye and a prompt	88.84236145019531
191/3605	He comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly	206.71534729003906
192/3605	He determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another mus	98.42547607421875
193/3605	The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the	85.06143188476562
194/3605	At the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his	62.18427276611328
195/3605	DArtagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the	51.0677604675293
196/3605	DArtagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single	95.49095153808594
197/3605	Besides courage was out of the question here DArtagnan had fallen into an	217.63113403320312
198/3605	If there is a third shot said he to himself I am a lost	89.86278533935547
199/3605	As he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of	190.8194122314453
200/3605	He sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to	112.11369323730469
201/3605	DArtagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his	48.051883697509766
202/3605	The ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus	830.8670654296875
203/3605	The accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been	226.356689453125
204/3605	This could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular	275.81622314453125
205/3605	This might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the	75.30802154541016
206/3605	It may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his Eminence with respect to	98.5794906616211
207/3605	For people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his Eminence had rarely recourse to such	482.6336669921875

209/3605	He tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice	327.5517272949219
210/3605	Ah my poor friends murmured DArtagnan where are you And that you should fail me   DArtagnan passed a very bad	31.92487907409668
211/3605	Three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing	303.428955078125
212/3605	Nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any	3478.123779296875
213/3605	But DArtagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinqu	417.47711181640625
214/3605	DArtagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was	166.94236755371094
215/3605	At nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to	158.24366760253906
216/3605	The guards were under arms and DArtagnan took his place in the midst of his	33.65446472167969
217/3605	Monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments	173.184814453125
218/3605	Dessessart captain of the Guards as well as the	1301.0155029296875
219/3605	At the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to DArtagnan that	46.835235595703125
220/3605	Dessessart made him a sign to	666.563720703125
221/3605	He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive	163.42466735839844
222/3605	Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in	101.75928497314453
223/3605	Thanks my captain replied DArtagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant	81.65113830566406
224/3605	In fact the Rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days	364.8614196777344
225/3605	The matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bast	3204.200439453125
226/3605	At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice and said I want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended	153.871826171875
227/3605	As to the man to be depended upon I have him under my hand monsieur said	84.14447021484375
228/3605	Dessessart pointing to DArtagnan and as to the four or five volunteers Monsieur has but to make his intentions known and the men will not be	192.33740234375
229/3605	Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said DArtagnan raising his	88.1124496459961
230/3605	Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed	805.0183715820312
231/3605	DArtagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the	222.79794311523438
232/3605	It was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the	364.8779296875
233/3605	DArtagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two Guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed	392.990478515625
234/3605	They arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bast	577.36669921875
235/3605	There on turning round DArtagnan perceived that the two soldiers had	33.50215530395508
236/3605	He thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to	247.24972534179688
237/3605	At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bast	385.525390625
238/3605	They saw no one and the bastion seemed	466.685546875
239/3605	The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around DArtagnan and his	717.6893920898438
240/3605	They knew all they wished to know the bastion was	124.92153930664062
241/3605	A longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless impr	390.2575378417969
242/3605	DArtagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a	99.91663360595703
243/3605	On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the Guardsmen	300.7197265625
244/3605	A ball had passed through his	182.3293914794922
245/3605	The other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the	147.09910583496094
246/3605	DArtagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were	100.35884857177734
247/3605	One ball struck the head of the alreadywounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of DArtagn	277.3329772949219
248/3605	The young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the	168.55740356445312
249/3605	The idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings	154.3831787109375
250/3605	He resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were	68.32769012451172
251/3605	He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two	317.8927307128906
252/3605	DArtagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the	92.318115234375
253/3605	As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making	176.01368713378906
254/3605	Fortunately deceived by DArtagnans trick they neglected to reload their	1125.42236328125
255/3605	When they were within ten paces of him DArtagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to	97.15227508544922
256/3605	The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the	325.23541259765625
257/3605	One of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a	203.8995361328125
258/3605	He aimed a terrible blow at DArtagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bast	116.96315002441406
259/3605	As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his	202.24864196777344
260/3605	Meantime DArtagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his	75.56060028076172
261/3605	The conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arqu	715.2589721679688
262/3605	The sword of the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who	1061.974365234375
263/3605	DArtagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his	46.02217102050781
264/3605	Oh do not kill me cried the band	39.10542297363281
265/3605	Pardon pardon my officer and I will tell you	81.9924545288086
266/3605	Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his	350.4104309082031
267/3605	Yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you	236.19410705566406
268/3605	Wretch cried DArtagnan speak quickly Who employed you to assassinate me   A woman whom I dont know but who is called Mil	115.94828796386719
269/3605	But if you dont know this woman how do you know her name   My comrade knows her and called her	100.0442123413086
270/3605	It was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as I have heard him	161.3292694091797
271/3605	But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair   He proposed to me to undertake it with him and I	168.6338653564453
272/3605	And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise   A hundred lou	68.52679443359375
273/3605	Well come said the young man laughing she thinks I am worth	146.7930450439453
274/3605	A hundred louis Well that was a temptation for two wretches like	353.17657470703125
275/3605	I understand why you accepted it and I grant you my pardon but upon one	209.6602783203125
276/3605	What is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not	130.46446228027344
277/3605	That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his	98.08982849121094
278/3605	But cried the bandit that is only another way of killing	148.08006286621094
279/3605	How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion   You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or I swear you shall die by my	86.31583404541016
280/3605	Pardon monsieur pity In the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his handfor he began to lose his strength with his	131.01112365722656
281/3605	And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love and that I believed that woman dead asked DArtagn	44.78252029418945
282/3605	By that letter which my comrade has in his	190.08438110351562
283/3605	You see then said DArtagnan that I must have that	38.19182586669922
284/3605	Stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of	1117.944091796875
285/3605	I will goI will go   DArtagnan took the soldiers arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his	273.7283935546875
286/3605	It was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from	113.7682876586914
287/3605	Terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that DArtagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt Stop said he I will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as	87.2447280883789
288/3605	Stay where you are I will go	46.66900634765625
289/3605	And with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground DArtagnan succeeded in reaching the second	152.8809814453125
290/3605	There were two means of gaining his objectto search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the	628.8108520507812
291/3605	DArtagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy	223.0043487548828
292/3605	A slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to DArtagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his	438.3657531738281
293/3605	DArtagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as	147.28271484375
294/3605	A leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead	149.4921875
295/3605	He left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocket	186.43910217285156
296/3605	If you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from	155.7342529296875
297/3605	Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Mil	199.64537048339844
298/3605	He consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded	216.0599822998047
299/3605	But what were you to do with that woman asked DArtagnan with	36.128238677978516
300/3605	We were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the Place Royale said the wounded	117.29255676269531
301/3605	There could be no doubt she owed this information to the	147.75900268554688
302/3605	But amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor M	289.33544921875
303/3605	Bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of Chaillot like an apparition were now	186.32969665527344
304/3605	Then also as Athos had predicted it became possible to find M	758.872314453125
305/3605	Bonacieux and a convent was not impregn	76.56006622314453
306/3605	This idea completely restored clemency to his	2447.89501953125
307/3605	He turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said Come I will not abandon you	75.37232208251953
308/3605	Lean upon me and let us return to the	36.47880554199219
309/3605	Yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged   You have my word said he for the second time I give you your	103.09127807617188
310/3605	The wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but DArtagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his	384.0835266113281
311/3605	The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four	420.1846618652344
312/3605	They were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and	138.62669372558594
313/3605	DArtagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_ which he	614.5162963867188
314/3605	He described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had	165.8087615966797
315/3605	This recital was for him the occasion of veritable	203.7739715576172
316/3605	The whole army talked of this expedition for a day and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon	199.7749786376953
317/3605	Besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of DArtagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had	447.18292236328125
318/3605	In fact DArtagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his	95.32334899902344
319/3605	This tranquillity proved one thingthat DArtagnan did not yet know Mil	88.45858001708984
320/3605	Martin and the fort of La Prée as on their side the French were besieging La Roc	1212.2548828125
321/3605	DArtagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have	226.75067138671875
322/3605	He only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his	144.1542510986328
323/3605	But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything was explained to him by this letter dated from Villeroy  	121.6733627319336
324/3605	They are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite	184.21571350097656
325/3605	I have done this and am monsieur with great respect     Your very humble and obedient servant GODEAU _Purveyor of the Musketeers_     Thats all well cried DArtagn	227.12193298339844
326/3605	They think of me in their pleasures as I thought of them in my	263.8229675292969
327/3605	Well I will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but I will not drink	133.63038635253906
328/3605	And DArtagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from Viller	403.2637634277344
329/3605	One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after	341.26287841796875
330/3605	The hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the	250.29298400878906
331/3605	Planchet waited towel on arm Fourreau uncorked the bottles and Brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decan	3936.140869140625
332/3605	Of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom Brisemont poured the lees into a glass and DArtagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his	305.421875
333/3605	The guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis and Fort Ne	572.8464965820312
334/3605	The Guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the English sprang to their	978.9175415039062
335/3605	DArtagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their	199.63328552246094
336/3605	But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this	150.26051330566406
337/3605	Cries of Live the king Live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all	392.8346252441406
338/3605	In short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand	616.5450439453125
339/3605	DArtagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and	158.8896026611328
340/3605	de Tréville who detected him at	178.45928955078125
341/3605	The ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers	423.825439453125
342/3605	_Pardieu_ cried DArtagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner cannot have had time to get cold Can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two Guards whom he introduced to his	142.53738403320312
343/3605	Ah ah said Porthos it appears we are feasting   I hope said Aramis there are no women at your	65.4727783203125
344/3605	Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked Ath	451.1249694824219
345/3605	Well _pardieu_ there is yours my dear friend replied DArtagn	16.91745948791504
346/3605	We sent you wine   You know very wellthe wine from the hills of Anj	440.6347351074219
347/3605	Yes I know what brand you are talking	226.643310546875
348/3605	Well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with	752.8801879882812
349/3605	And so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some Anjou wine said Porth	254.85096740722656
350/3605	Not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your	243.11962890625
351/3605	On our account said the three Musket	308.2572326660156
352/3605	Did you send this wine Aramis said Ath	103.91004943847656
353/3605	No and you Porthos   No and you Athos   No   If it was not you it was your purveyor said DArtagn	41.516151428222656
354/3605	Our purveyor   Yes your purveyor Godeauthe purveyor of the Musket	582.1289672851562
355/3605	My faith never mind where it comes from said Porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink	88.93544006347656
356/3605	No said Athos dont let us drink wine which comes from an unknown	169.28355407714844
357/3605	Did none of you charge your purveyor Godeau to send me some wine   No And yet you say he has sent you some as from us   Here is his letter said DArtagnan and he presented the note to his	150.732421875
358/3605	This is not his writing said Ath	56.38739013671875
359/3605	I am acquainted with it before we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the	140.7012176513672
360/3605	A false letter altogether said Porthos we have not been	331.1744384765625
361/3605	DArtagnan said Aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance   DArtagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his	54.38091278076172
362/3605	DArtagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three Musketeers and the two Guards following	267.39068603515625
363/3605	The first object that met the eyes of DArtagnan on entering the room was Brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convuls	349.0709228515625
364/3605	Planchet and Fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was uselessall the features of the dying man were distorted with	299.54815673828125
365/3605	Ah cried he on perceiving DArtagnan ah this is frightful You pretend to pardon me and you poison me   I cried DArtagn	55.140071868896484
366/3605	I wretch What do you say   I say that it was you who gave me the wine I say that it was you who desired me to drink	42.795166015625
367/3605	I say you wished to avenge yourself on me and I say that it is horrible   Do not think so Brisemont said DArtagnan do not think	72.07986450195312
368/3605	I do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tort	146.93492126464844
369/3605	Frightful frightful murmured Athos while Porthos broke the bottles and Aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent	91.0904312133789
370/3605	Oh my friends said DArtagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these	49.55371856689453
371/3605	Gentlemen continued he addressing the Guardsmen I request you will be silent with regard to this	563.4326171875
372/3605	Great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon	398.22406005859375
373/3605	Alas said Fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror I wanted to get him out of the way that I might drink	462.71978759765625
374/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan addressing the Guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day I beg of	271.8910827636719
375/3605	The two Guardsmen courteously accepted DArtagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone	657.28466796875
376/3605	When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their	311.46746826171875
377/3605	In the first place said Athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent	148.57765197753906
378/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan I commit the corpse of this poor devil to your	47.82210159301758
379/3605	Let him be interred in holy	910.9347534179688
380/3605	He committed a crime it is true but he repented of	385.75469970703125
381/3605	And the four friends quit the room leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisem	2774.811279296875
382/3605	The host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which Athos went himself to draw at the	324.4330749511719
383/3605	In a few words Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the	37.672725677490234
384/3605	Well said DArtagnan to Athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the	31.144338607788086
385/3605	Yes yes replied he I perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she   I am sure of	42.21388626098633
386/3605	But the _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder   She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France and has been branded in	579.8655395507812
387/3605	Athos she is your wife I tell you repeated DArtagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each	424.3257141113281
388/3605	Yes but I should think the other must be dead I hanged her so effect	149.84136962890625
389/3605	It was DArtagnan who now shook his head in his	20.55573844909668
390/3605	But in either case what is to be done said the young	37.683773040771484
391/3605	The fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said Ath	219.3773651123047
392/3605	We must extricate ourselves from this	413.58013916015625
393/3605	But how   Listen You must try to see her and have an explanation with	103.60355377197266
394/3605	Say to her Peace or war My word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to	386.0899658203125
395/3605	I like the means well enough said DArtagnan but where and how to meet with her   Time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of	387.42999267578125
396/3605	The more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to	266.8861389160156
397/3605	Yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poison	846.672119140625
398/3605	God has preserved us hitherto God will preserve us	1510.7733154296875
399/3605	Besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but _she_ asked he in an undert	214.9544677734375
400/3605	Madame Bonacieux Ah thats true said Ath	192.67364501953125
401/3605	My poor friend I had forgotten you were in	140.91526794433594
402/3605	I am only temporarily a Musketeer said Aramis hum	318.97943115234375
403/3605	It is some time since we heard from his mistress said Athos in a low	41.78337097167969
404/3605	But take no notice we know all about	99.77485656738281
405/3605	Well said Porthos it appears to me that the means are very	41.779544830322266
406/3605	You say she is in a convent replied Porth	51.02325439453125
407/3605	As soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that	705.2987060546875
408/3605	But we must first learn what convent she is	418.95501708984375
409/3605	But I think I have it said Ath	17.41530418395996
410/3605	Dont you say dear DArtagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her   I believe so at	42.32920455932617
411/3605	In that case Porthos will assist	54.236690521240234
412/3605	And how so if you please   Why by your marchioness your duchess your	124.33042907714844
413/3605	Hush said Porthos placing a finger on his	53.38357162475586
414/3605	I believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the	127.27877044677734
415/3605	Then said Aramis I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of	84.419677734375
416/3605	You And how   By the queens almoner to whom I am very intimately allied said Aramis	797.9716796875
417/3605	And on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that	188.1039581298828
418/3605	DArtagnan returned to less important affairs and the three Musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their	209.72268676757812
419/3605	Bassompierre and Schomberg against the Duc dAngoulê	13931.693359375
420/3605	The result was that to prevent	3656.9990234375
421/3605	Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to	3414.93212890625
422/3605	Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between Leu and Dompierre the Duc dAngoulême on the east from Dompierre to Perigny and	1216.685546875
423/3605	de Schomberg on the south from Perigny to Angout	18383.62890625
424/3605	The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at Estrée sometimes at Jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of La Pierre in a simple house without any entrench	1583.7706298828125
425/3605	So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre the king the Duc dAngoulême and the cardinal	334.9079284667969
426/3605	As soon as this organization was established they set about driving the English from the	977.342529296875
427/3605	The English who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their	1597.52783203125
428/3605	The result was that even if the kings troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other Buckingham who only continued in the Isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the	271.9395751953125
429/3605	de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive	289.18304443359375
430/3605	Simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre	193.03302001953125
431/3605	Te Deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout	8051.31982421875
432/3605	The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the	132.78787231445312
433/3605	But it must be acknowledged this response was but moment	1105.014892578125
434/3605	An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham named Montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire Spain England and Lor	1024.5303955078125
435/3605	Still further in Buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised M	3234.904541015625
436/3605	It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without	345.2574462890625
437/3605	All therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of	335.0342712402344
438/3605	The cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of	279.1697998046875
439/3605	If the league which threatened France triumphed all his influence would be	2675.72314453125
440/3605	Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre where they had as yet but partisans and he Richelieuthe French minister the national ministerwould be	1062.173828125
441/3605	The king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the	220.3448028564453
442/3605	He would then be lost and France perhaps with	215.82325744628906
443/3605	Courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre in which the cardinal had established his	368.1674499511719
444/3605	There were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been	384.36566162109375
445/3605	It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies	564.09716796875
446/3605	On their part the Musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous	238.02493286132812
447/3605	This was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of	263.27239990234375
448/3605	de Tréville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the	308.4800109863281
449/3605	They immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the	702.0349731445312
450/3605	In an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go	252.615478515625
451/3605	The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and Athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice Who goes there   Who goes there yourselves replied one of the horse	168.13397216796875
452/3605	That is not an answer replied Ath	52.78841018676758
453/3605	Who goes there Answer or we	3293.134521484375
454/3605	Beware of what you are about gentlemen said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to	190.50595092773438
455/3605	It is some superior officer making his night rounds said Ath	750.2021484375
456/3605	What do you wish gentlemen   Who are you said the same voice in the same commanding	76.13801574707031
457/3605	Answer in your turn or you may repent of your	485.2122802734375
458/3605	Kings Musketeers said Athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do	108.5926284790039
459/3605	What company   Company of Tré	1012.153564453125
460/3605	Advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this	159.9441680908203
461/3605	The three companions advanced rather humblyfor all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselvesleaving Athos the post of	629.7061767578125
462/3605	One of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his	133.88986206054688
463/3605	Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced	41.54392623901367
464/3605	Your pardon my officer said Athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good	103.75141906738281
465/3605	Your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his	69.03468322753906
466/3605	But yourself monsieur said Athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me I beg you the proof that you have the right to question	58.06314468383789
467/3605	Your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face	241.2465362548828
468/3605	Monsieur the Cardinal cried the stupefied Musket	83.83172607421875
469/3605	Your name cried his Eminence for the third	139.6671905517578
470/3605	The cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew	57.39311599731445
471/3605	These three Musketeers shall follow us said he in an undert	122.56049346923828
472/3605	I am not willing it should be known I have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell	141.26483154296875

474/3605	Thank God we can keep a	363.8091125488281
475/3605	The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous	1332.59033203125
476/3605	You have a quick ear Monsieur Athos said the cardinal but now listen to	70.9488754272461
477/3605	It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow me but for my	152.8251495361328
478/3605	Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and Aram	111.11154174804688
479/3605	Yes your Eminence said Athos while the two Musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in	189.49937438964844
480/3605	I know you gentlemen said the cardinal I know	33.496253967285156
481/3605	I know you are not quite my friends and I am sorry you are not so but I know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in	65.73021697998047
482/3605	Monsieur Athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty if we should meet	78.51407623291016
483/3605	The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their	389.25433349609375
484/3605	Well upon my honor said Athos your Eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several illlooking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those	351.0398864746094
485/3605	A quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know I dont like quarrel	300.4670104980469
486/3605	And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in	130.78424072265625
487/3605	What have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his	174.31912231445312
488/3605	My friend Aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your Eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your Eminence orders an escal	816.0303955078125
489/3605	But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the	430.8087463378906
490/3605	Come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody Confess you know I have the right of giving abs	614.8543090820312
491/3605	I did not even draw my sword but I took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the	127.0007553100586
492/3605	It appears that in falling continued Athos with some hesitation he broke his	211.8712921142578
493/3605	Ah ah said the cardinal and you Monsieur Porthos   I monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibitedI seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder is	89.1417007446289
494/3605	Then I admit my patience failed me I drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his	121.85184478759766
495/3605	I only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two	63.90223693847656
496/3605	The devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed _hors de combat_ in a cabaret squabble You dont do your work by	1961.7515869140625
497/3605	And pray what was this quarrel about   These fellows were drunk said Athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her	185.865234375
498/3605	Force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose   To do her violence without doubt said Ath	128.23147583007812
499/3605	I have had the honor of informing your Eminence that these men were	121.15249633789062
500/3605	And was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of	117.51178741455078
501/3605	We did not see her monseigneur said Ath	22.16685676574707
502/3605	You did not see her Ah very well replied the cardinal	104.6491470336914
503/3605	You did well to defend the honor of a woman and as I am going to the Red Dovecot myself I shall know if you have told me the	174.25637817382812
504/3605	Monseigneur said Athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a	94.60670471191406
505/3605	Judge not rashly says the Gospel replied the	1698.1837158203125
506/3605	And now gentlemen thats well continued the	422.0487060546875
507/3605	I know what I wish to know follow	62.15717697143555
508/3605	The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four	190.52783203125
509/3605	They soon arrived at the silent solitary	1263.7425537109375
510/3605	No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the	1953.4066162109375
511/3605	Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to	77.45171356201172
512/3605	A saddled horse was fastened to the window	517.3670654296875
513/3605	The cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar	321.3888244628906
514/3605	A man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of Surgères which was likewise the way to	185.29774475097656
515/3605	You have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the Musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to	147.87933349609375
516/3605	The cardinal alighted the three Musketeers did	185.6996612548828
517/3605	The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shut	111.579833984375
518/3605	For him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a	167.8053436279297
519/3605	Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the	127.85018920898438
520/3605	The host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chim	130.79017639160156
521/3605	Enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me I shall not be more than half an	44.40043640136719
522/3605	And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to	190.61370849609375
523/3605	Now who was that someone That was the question the three Musketeers put to one	284.5046691894531
524/3605	Then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject Porthos called the host and asked for	381.1572570800781
525/3605	Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to	24.804279327392578
526/3605	Athos walked about in a contemplative	16119.994140625
527/3605	While thinking and walking Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his	251.39939880371094
528/3605	Athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower or	171.4949188232422
529/3605	Listen Milady said the cardinal the affair is	252.99398803710938
530/3605	Sit down and let us talk it	91.3133544921875
531/3605	I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the Musketeer	794.5908813476562
532/3605	A small vessel with an English crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of Charente at Fort La Point	675.815185546875
533/3605	Fort La Pointe or Fort Vasou was not built until 1672 nearly 50 years	25691.9140625
534/3605	I must go thither tonight   Instantly That is to say when you have received my	124.25177764892578
535/3605	Two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as	254.6715545654297
536/3605	You will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your	54.61280822753906
537/3605	Now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of your Eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that I may not commit an	137.3500213623047
538/3605	There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocut	320.8480224609375
539/3605	It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be	229.50668334960938
540/3605	Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with	111.90667724609375
541/3605	The two Musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Ath	286.85394287109375
542/3605	All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the	206.88584899902344
543/3605	You will go to London continued the	130.63235473632812
544/3605	Arrived in London you will seek	1494.1806640625
545/3605	I must beg your Eminence to observe said Milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his Grace distrusts	665.4357299804688
546/3605	Well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a	531.1626586914062
547/3605	Frankly and loyally repeated Milady with an unspeakable expression of dupl	1403.1549072265625
548/3605	Yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same	356.20806884765625
549/3605	All this negotiation must be carried on	1732.7659912109375
550/3605	I will follow your Eminences instructions to the	693.4878540039062
551/3605	I only wait till you give	126.54036712646484
552/3605	You will go to Buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him I am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes I will ruin the	78.42539978027344
553/3605	Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made   Yes for I have the	167.3032684326172
554/3605	I must be able to present these proofs for his	385.72357177734375
555/3605	And you will tell him I will publish the report of BoisRobert and the Marquis de Beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a mas	370.5746154785156
556/3605	You will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the Great Mogul which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pist	91.7447280883789
557/3605	Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power that Montague is in the Bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not	434.61309814453125
558/3605	You recollect perfectly all I have told you do you not   Your Eminence will judge the ball of Madame the Constable the night at the Louvre the evening at Amiens the arrest of Montague the letter of Madame de Chevre	159.69944763183594
559/3605	Thats it said the cardinal thats	274.6657409667969
560/3605	But resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace France   The duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied Richelieu with great	258.19219970703125
561/3605	Like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady	593.0330200195312
562/3605	If he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says I will answer for it he will look	119.67172241210938
563/3605	And yet said Milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists   If he persists said the	190.65234375
564/3605	If he persists His Eminence made a pause and resumed If he persistswell then I shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of	470.3913269042969
565/3605	If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said Milady perhaps I should partake of your confidence as to the	294.28167724609375
566/3605	Well here for example said Richelieu when in 1610 for a cause similar to that which moves the duke King Henry	581.0958862304688
567/3605	of glorious memory was about at the same time to invade Flanders and Italy in order to attack Austria on both	497.16949462890625
568/3605	Ay and observeit just occurs to me that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham and their preachers designate him as the Antich	4044.49462890625
569/3605	Well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the d	158.6303253173828
570/3605	The duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidel	1107.093994140625
571/3605	No doubt said Milady coolly such a woman may be	319.77716064453125
572/3605	Well such a woman who would place the knife of Jacques Clément or of Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save	2076.6259765625
573/3605	Yes but she would then be the accomplice of an	107.30307006835938
574/3605	Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clément ever known   No for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they	1627.0264892578125
575/3605	The Palace of Justice would not be burned down for everybody monseign	327.5362854003906
576/3605	You think then that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused by chance asked Richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no	157.9879913330078
577/3605	I think nothing I quote a fact that is	354.10693359375
578/3605	Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier or the Queen Marie de Médicis I should use less precautions than I take being simply called Milady Clar	1381.9783935546875
579/3605	What do you require then   I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should think proper to do for the greatest good of	150.51817321777344
580/3605	But in the first place this woman I have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the d	73.61727142333984
581/3605	Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of Gods	484.8070983886719
582/3605	Well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now	93.1947021484375
583/3605	Then if he persists notwithstanding all thisas that is as I have said the limit of my missionI shall have nothing to do but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of	180.5487060546875
584/3605	That is it is it not monseigneur and I shall have nothing else to do   That is it replied the cardinal dry	41.0192985534668
585/3605	Yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for I made them by serving your Emin	244.29275512695312
586/3605	In the first place there is a little _intrigante_ named Bonacie	293.09356689453125
587/3605	She is in the prison of N	540.1622924804688
588/3605	That is to say she was there replied Milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a	85.2286605834961
589/3605	And to which   I dont know the secret has been well	91.90547180175781
590/3605	But _I_ will know   And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is   I can see nothing inconvenient in that said the	176.09385681152344
591/3605	Well now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little Madame Bonacie	156.6832733154297
592/3605	Who is that   Her	227.56967163085938
593/3605	What is his name   Oh your Eminence knows him well cried Milady carried away by her	324.9286193847656
594/3605	He is the evil genius of both of	180.41763305664062
595/3605	Ah ah said the cardinal I know of whom you	79.18214416503906
596/3605	He is a bold fellow said the	40.761680603027344
597/3605	And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be	78.61856079101562
598/3605	I must have said the duke a proof of his connection with	103.59574127197266
599/3605	A proof cried Milady I will have	386.8612060546875
600/3605	Well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and I will send him to the Bast	183.7587127685547
601/3605	So far good monseigneur but afterwards   When once in the Bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low	139.39300537109375
602/3605	Ah _pardieu_ continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity   Monseigneur replied Milady a fair	101.92668151855469
603/3605	Life for life man for man give me one I will give you the	190.70571899414062
604/3605	An infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel   Give me paper a quill and some ink then said the	117.54597473144531
605/3605	There was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing	152.5460968017578
606/3605	Athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the	40.12324523925781
607/3605	Well said Porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation   Hush said Athos speaking in a low	18.715280532836914
608/3605	We have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides I dont prevent you from listening but I must be	181.85867309570312
609/3605	I will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire	208.01919555664062
610/3605	The rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about	918.4155883789062
611/3605	Be easy on that head replied Athos you know I am cool	212.0736541748047
612/3605	Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stove	293.8360900878906
613/3605	A CONJUGAL SCENE     As Athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came	858.116455078125
614/3605	He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were and found Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aram	107.81441497802734
615/3605	He cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was	74.80998229980469
616/3605	What has become of Monseigneur Athos asked	36.859703063964844
617/3605	Monseigneur replied Porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not	144.37890625
618/3605	And you what have you done Monsieur Porthos   I have won five pistoles of Aram	40.568763732910156

621/3605	The attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the brid	50.50168991088867
622/3605	At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the	80.88687896728516
623/3605	These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to Fort La Pointe and superintend her embark	1029.287109375
624/3605	The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Ath	158.1446990966797
625/3605	The cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in	647.4484252929688
626/3605	Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two Musketeers and return to Ath	94.704833984375
627/3605	For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little	147.9085235595703
628/3605	My officer said Athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forget	143.85787963867188
629/3605	Go up said the host she is still in her	96.60237884521484
630/3605	Athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived Milady putting on her	346.76275634765625
631/3605	He entered the chamber and closed the door behind	38.088470458984375
632/3605	At the noise he made in pushing the bolt Milady turned	365.1898498535156
633/3605	Athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his	129.93258666992188
634/3605	On seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue Milady was	559.7417602539062
635/3605	Who are you and what do you want cried	77.36519622802734
636/3605	Humph murmured Athos it is certainly she   And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward Mil	230.4002227783203
637/3605	Do you know me madame said	24.280977249145508
638/3605	Milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a	107.84315490722656
639/3605	So far well said Athos I perceive you know	91.39319610595703
640/3605	The Comte de la Fère murmured Milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any	512.01220703125
641/3605	Yes Milady replied Athos the Comte de la Fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a	97.71551513671875
642/3605	Sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal	55.04912185668945
643/3605	Milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a	116.0651626586914
644/3605	You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said Ath	179.71665954589844
645/3605	Your power is great I know but you also know that with the help of God men have often conquered the most terrible	250.38059997558594
646/3605	You have once before thrown yourself in my	398.0184631347656
647/3605	I thought I had crushed you madame but either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you   Milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed gro	235.25869750976562
648/3605	Yes hell has resuscitated you continued Ath	1104.8958740234375
649/3605	Hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your	726.1406860351562
650/3605	Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed	607.4879150390625
651/3605	You believed me to be dead did you not as I believed you to be And the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fère as the name Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breu	288.626220703125
652/3605	Was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us Our position is truly a strange one continued Athos	807.8666381835938
653/3605	We have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes dev	548.1500854492188
654/3605	But said Milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me   I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes I have not lost sight of	69.00003814697266
655/3605	You know what I have done   I can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this	68.81025695800781
656/3605	A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Mil	136.33184814453125
657/3605	Perhaps said Athos But at all events listen well to	154.26528930664062
658/3605	Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedI care very little about that I dont know	219.1899871826172
659/3605	Athos was seized with a kind of vert	238.06214904785156
660/3605	The sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembr	417.1662902832031
661/3605	He thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his	137.7172088623047
662/3605	His desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked	282.0356750488281
663/3605	Milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild	234.96597290039062
664/3605	Motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of	273.3729553222656
665/3605	With another man Milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew Ath	387.3834228515625
666/3605	You have one second to decide said	398.1414794921875
667/3605	Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward Ath	125.51252746582031
668/3605	Take it said she and be accursed   Athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read  	92.30751037597656
669/3605	3 1627     It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	92.79742431640625
670/3605	RICHELIEU     And now said Athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that I have drawn your teeth viper bite if you	430.6939392089844
671/3605	And he left the chamber without once looking behind	242.1243438720703
672/3605	At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they	84.66563415527344
673/3605	Gentlemen said he Monseigneurs order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to Fort La Pointe and never to leave her till she is on	1147.782470703125
674/3605	As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of ass	277.0198669433594
675/3605	With regard to Athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to	108.71007537841797
676/3605	In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the	145.74224853515625
677/3605	He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his	46.03462600708008
678/3605	He immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the	184.3175506591797
679/3605	Who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horse	106.92532348632812
680/3605	That is our brave Musketeer I think said the	296.9820556640625
681/3605	Yes monseigneur said Porthos it is	10.352853775024414
682/3605	Monsieur Athos said Richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have	90.70679473876953
683/3605	Gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the	944.6575317382812
684/3605	Saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendantfor that night he himself slept in the	142.49021911621094
685/3605	Well said Porthos and Aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required   I know it said Athos coolly since here it	64.88896179199219
686/3605	And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentin	160.05921936035156
687/3605	Only they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the Musket	80.43598937988281
688/3605	Milady as Athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following	135.823974609375
689/3605	She had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of Ath	108.760009765625
690/3605	She might say that Athos had hanged her but then Athos would tell that she was	380.9969787597656
691/3605	She thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her	298.17498779296875
692/3605	THE BASTION SAINTGERVAIS     On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends DArtagnan found them assembled in the same	1068.7215576171875
693/3605	Athos was meditating Porthos was twisting his mustache Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours bound in blue	886.4923706054688
694/3605	I hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else I warn you I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bast	214.89112854003906
695/3605	Ah why were you not there gentlemen It was warm	606.5856323242188
696/3605	We were in a place where it was not very cold replied Porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to	100.15438079833984
697/3605	Oh oh said DArtagnan comprehending the slight frown of the Musket	74.96729278564453
698/3605	It appears there is something fresh	1135.9871826171875
699/3605	Aramis said Athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot I believe  	84.91841125488281
700/3605	How did you fare   For my part I ate but	175.3533172607422
701/3605	The day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but	324.44219970703125
702/3605	What said Athos no fish at a seaport   They say said Aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open	669.9385375976562
703/3605	But that is not quite what I mean to ask you Aramis replied Ath	31.661842346191406
704/3605	I want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted	136.4040985107422
705/3605	Why I think there were not many intr	3035.81787109375
706/3605	Yes Athos I know what you mean we shall do very well at the Parpaill	100.30784606933594
707/3605	Let us go to the Parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of	378.88128662109375
708/3605	DArtagnan who was accustomed to his friends manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took Athoss arm and went out without saying	129.2487335205078
709/3605	Athos made him a sign to come with	161.2894287109375
710/3605	Grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to	547.03955078125
711/3605	They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaill	566.74560546875
712/3605	It was seven oclock in the morning and daylight began to	44.44083023071289
713/3605	The three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be	117.82947540283203
714/3605	Unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private	1067.3109130859375
715/3605	The morning drum had just been beaten everyone shook off the drowsiness of night and to dispel the humid morning air came to take a drop at the	741.140380859375
716/3605	Dragoons Swiss Guardsmen Musketeers lighthorsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four	796.3475341796875
717/3605	Thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their	1075.467041015625
718/3605	I see how it will be said Athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just	77.56036376953125
719/3605	DArtagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours	148.53585815429688
720/3605	Ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped	592.6988525390625
721/3605	I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the Rochella	266.2695007324219
722/3605	DArtagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their	126.4058837890625
723/3605	Well said Athos dont you hear Monsieur de Busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question Relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know	113.37225341796875
724/3605	Have you not taken a bastion said a Swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer	443.98504638671875
725/3605	Yes monsieur said DArtagnan bowing we have had that	14.512740135192871
726/3605	We even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty	488.3963623046875
727/3605	Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly	315.05810546875
728/3605	And what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be	830.337158203125
729/3605	Gervais replied DArtagnan from behind which the Rochellais annoyed our work	305.8130187988281
730/3605	Was that affair hot   Yes moderately	1156.4344482421875
731/3605	We lost five men and the Rochellais eight or	388.28533935546875
732/3605	_Balzempleu_ said the Swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the German language had acquired a habit of swearing in	1533.5966796875
733/3605	But it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bast	915.386962890625
734/3605	Gentlemen said Athos a wager   Ah _wooi_ a vager cried the	254.27294921875
735/3605	Stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit I am in	661.56982421875
736/3605	You cursed host a dripping pan immediately that I may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable	579.3211059570312
737/3605	You was right said the Swiss goose grease is kood with bas	33880.61328125
738/3605	Now for the wager We listen Monsieur Ath	86.6078109741211
739/3605	Well Monsieur de Busigny I will bet you said Athos that my three companions Messieurs Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion	82.70443725585938
740/3605	Gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge	691.8473510742188
741/3605	Porthos and Aramis looked at each other they began to	24.885639190673828
742/3605	But said DArtagnan in the ear of Athos you are going to get us all killed without	30.72124481201172
743/3605	We are much more likely to be killed said Athos if we do not	41.30940246582031
744/3605	My faith gentlemen said Porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache thats a fair bet I	316.83795166015625
745/3605	de Busigny so let us fix the	813.9962768554688
746/3605	You are four gentlemen said Athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for	143.57395935058594
747/3605	Will that do   Capitally replied	985.0938720703125
748/3605	The fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the	561.322509765625
749/3605	The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the	193.44296264648438
750/3605	Athos called Grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the nap	432.6157531738281
751/3605	Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his	518.432373046875
752/3605	But where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the	63.646942138671875
753/3605	What matter if you are paid for it said Athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the	93.67953491210938
754/3605	Shall I give you the change my officer said the	85.85518646240234
755/3605	No only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the nap	759.4058837890625
756/3605	The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two bottles of	436.70458984375
757/3605	Thirtyfive minutes after seven said Athos by which you perceive I am five minutes faster than	287.12847900390625
758/3605	And bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion	132.74761962890625
759/3605	Gervais followed by Grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which Athos had taught him not even thinking of	189.65785217285156
760/3605	As long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exchange one word besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of	100.17878723144531
761/3605	But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain DArtagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an	157.4582977294922
762/3605	And now my dear Athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going   Why you see plainly enough we are going to the bast	39.361629486083984
763/3605	But what are we going to do there   You know well that we go to breakfast	32.41715621948242
764/3605	Here at least said Athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb	77.29814910888672
765/3605	It appears to me said DArtagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seash	383.5392150878906
766/3605	Where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a	101.47457122802734
767/3605	Yes said Aramis Athos is right _Animadvertuntur in desertis	6790.607421875
768/3605	A desert would not have been amiss said Porthos but it behooved us to find	270.8056335449219
769/3605	There is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and I believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the	824.7188720703125
770/3605	Better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we cannot retreat without	1542.1507568359375
771/3605	We have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which I defy anyone to divine the true	190.1924285888672
772/3605	We are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bast	104.1917724609375
773/3605	Either we shall be attacked or	96.67578887939453
774/3605	If we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor I guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the	178.8891143798828
775/3605	Moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with	1656.6217041015625
776/3605	You see that everything is to our	386.9331359863281
777/3605	Yes said DArtagnan but we shall indubitably attract a	673.2578125
778/3605	Well my dear replied Athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the	118.35999298095703
779/3605	But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our musk	191.19102478027344
780/3605	Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden   I dont find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an	536.192626953125
781/3605	Well replied Athos have you not heard what DArtagnan said   What did he say demanded Porth	28.637500762939453
782/3605	DArtagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten Frenchmen were killed and as many Rochella	147.4808807373047
783/3605	What then   The bodies were not plundered were they It appears the conquerors had something else to	127.97511291503906
784/3605	Well   Well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to	369.7866516113281
785/3605	Oh Athos said Aramis truly you are a great	36.691532135009766
786/3605	Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastionsomething he had till then doubtedhe pulled his master by the skirt of his	427.60296630859375
787/3605	Where are we going asked he by a	98.54076385498047
788/3605	But said Grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins	329.9270324707031
789/3605	Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward	232.25302124023438
790/3605	Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the	209.72909545898438
791/3605	Athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to Grimauds	305.0185852050781
792/3605	Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a	224.1328887939453
793/3605	Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on	315.6310119628906
794/3605	All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the v	433.13983154296875
795/3605	Arrived at the bastion the four friends turned	187.97377014160156
796/3605	More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished	223.73086547851562
797/3605	de Busigny the dragoon the Swiss and the fourth bet	2902.52880859375
798/3605	Athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the	69.7685546875
799/3605	All the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither Grimaud had preceded	373.06866455078125
800/3605	THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS     As Athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses French and Rochella	8218.7509765625
801/3605	Gentlemen said Athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while Grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges	505.55096435546875
802/3605	We can talk while performing that necessary	3998.175537109375
803/3605	These gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies cannot hear	304.8106689453125
804/3605	But we could throw them into the ditch said Porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their	114.72254180908203
805/3605	Well then cried DArtagnan pray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the	90.48772430419922
806/3605	Heaven forfend said Athos they may serve	464.27569580078125
807/3605	Judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied Ath	244.89236450195312
808/3605	How many guns gentlemen   Twelve replied Aram	237.41079711914062
809/3605	How many shots   A	161.21046447753906
810/3605	Thats quite as many as we shall	401.5736083984375
811/3605	The four Musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was	216.96632385253906
812/3605	Athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to Grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sent	1190.485595703125
813/3605	Only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty Athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of	328.4584045410156
814/3605	The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks or even tail	875.8552856445312
815/3605	And now said DArtagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard I hope you are going to let me into your	34.607303619384766
816/3605	I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said Ath	113.54066467285156
817/3605	I have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmentwo classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each	852.710205078125
818/3605	The secret is said Athos that I saw Milady last	142.45277404785156
819/3605	DArtagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of Milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the	103.7586441040039
820/3605	You saw your wi   Hush interrupted Ath	385.1237487792969
821/3605	You forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like	202.70318603515625
822/3605	Within two leagues of this place at the inn of the Red Dove	1024.9892578125
823/3605	In that case I am lost said DArtagn	16.12271499633789
824/3605	Not so bad yet replied Athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of	123.54914093017578
825/3605	But after all asked Porthos who is Milady   A charming woman said Athos sipping a glass of sparkling	116.40115356445312
826/3605	What by demanding my head of the cardinal cried DArtagnan pale with	77.03113555908203
827/3605	Yes that is true as the Gospel said Porthos I heard her with my own	133.02920532226562
828/3605	Then said DArtagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle	246.71835327148438
829/3605	I may as well blow my brains out and all will be	263.93280029296875
830/3605	Thats the last folly to be committed said Athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no	146.07481384277344
831/3605	But I can never escape said DArtagnan with such	45.41813659667969
832/3605	First my stranger of Meung then De Wardes to whom I have given three sword wounds next Milady whose secret I have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance I have balk	1723.8226318359375
833/3605	Well said Athos that only makes four and we are fourone for	188.2407989501953
834/3605	_Pardieu_ if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of	92.75397491455078
835/3605	What is it Grimaud Considering the gravity of the occasion I permit you to speak my friend but be laconic I	373.8934020996094
836/3605	What do you see   A	50.6945915222168
837/3605	Of how many persons   Twenty	182.81202697753906
838/3605	What sort of men   Sixteen pioneers four	549.1473388671875
839/3605	How far distant   Five hundred p	211.07284545898438
840/3605	Good We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health DArtagn	83.4679183959961
841/3605	To your health repeated Porthos and Aram	27.859764099121094
842/3605	Well then to my health although I am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to	101.73948669433594
843/3605	Bah said Athos God is great as say the followers of Mohammed and the future is in his	450.79791259765625
844/3605	Then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him Athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the	144.0316619873047
845/3605	Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan followed his	26.40348243713379
846/3605	As to Grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their	202.04188537597656
847/3605	_Pardieu_ said Athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovel	888.120849609375
848/3605	Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and I am convinced they would have left us in	85.64215850830078
849/3605	I doubt that replied DArtagnan for they are advancing very res	107.28717041015625
850/3605	Besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with musk	209.33262634277344
851/3605	Thats because they dont see us said Ath	138.423583984375
852/3605	My faith said Aramis I must confess I feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of	170.44471740722656
853/3605	He is a bad priest said Porthos who has pity for here	146.5025634765625
854/3605	In truth said Athos Aramis is	69.56525421142578
855/3605	What the devil are you going to do cried DArtagnan you will be	18.12125587463379
856/3605	Now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at	146.00927734375
857/3605	Take care Athos cried DArtagnan dont you see they are aiming   Yes yes said Athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit	83.47261047363281
858/3605	In fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos but not one touched	183.03305053710938
859/3605	Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was	1059.98095703125
860/3605	Grimaud said Athos still on the breach another musket   Grimaud immediately ob	165.1448516845703
861/3605	On their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the	747.0426025390625
862/3605	The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to	385.74859619140625
863/3605	Reload the muskets Grimaud said Athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our	154.44798278808594
864/3605	Where were we   I recollect you were saying said DArtagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal Milady had quit the shores of	68.97095489501953
865/3605	Whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route Milady	1292.8726806640625
866/3605	With what view   With the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the Duke of	640.5086669921875
867/3605	DArtagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and	15.587495803833008
868/3605	As to that said Athos I beg you to believe that I care very little about	37.4949951171875
869/3605	Now you have done Grimaud take our brigadiers halfpike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the	399.7262268066406
870/3605	An instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four	449.6499938964844
871/3605	A thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the	431.63330078125
872/3605	How replied DArtagnan you care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed But the duke is our	186.60238647460938
873/3605	The duke is English the duke fights against	507.5950012207031
874/3605	Let her do what she likes with the duke I care no more about him than an empty	187.87771606445312
875/3605	And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his	147.9034423828125
876/3605	He gave us some very fine	231.4816131591797
877/3605	And moreover very handsome saddles said Porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his	99.86648559570312
878/3605	Besides said Aramis God desires the conversion and not the death of a s	466.12689208984375
879/3605	But this creature must be a demon said Porthos holding out his plate to Aramis who was cutting up a f	89.24113464355469
880/3605	And this _carte blanche_ said DArtagnan this _carte blanche_ does it remain in her hands   No it passed into mine I will not say without trouble for if I did I should tell a	290.3461608886719
881/3605	My dear Athos I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my	63.329010009765625
882/3605	Then it was to go to her that you left us said Aram	41.51639938354492
883/3605	And you have that letter of the cardinal said DArtagn	26.03662109375
884/3605	Here it is said Athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his	110.70384979248047
885/3605	DArtagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read  	88.67315673828125
886/3605	3 1627     It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	92.79742431640625
887/3605	RICHELIEU     In fact said Aramis it is an absolution according to	847.1478271484375
888/3605	That paper must be torn to pieces said DArtagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of	101.98234558105469
889/3605	On the contrary said Athos it must be preserved	131.58311462402344
890/3605	I would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold	170.75360107421875
891/3605	And what will she do now asked the young	74.57193756103516
892/3605	The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest DArtagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the Bast	121.20171356201172
893/3605	Go to It appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said Porth	173.72042846679688
894/3605	I say I am entirely of Porthoss opinion replied Aram	51.072242736816406
895/3605	Fortunately she is far off said Porthos for I confess she would worry me if she were	126.10589599609375
896/3605	She worries me in England as well as in France said Ath	79.18233489990234
897/3605	But when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said Porth	106.2647476196289
898/3605	It is only the dead who do not	95.82310485839844
899/3605	You think so Porthos replied the Musketeer with a sad smile which DArtagnan alone	52.32413864135742
900/3605	The young men sprang up and seized their musk	82.85162353515625
901/3605	This time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the	469.873046875
902/3605	Shall we return to the camp said Porth	48.16682434082031
903/3605	I dont think the sides are	815.114501953125
904/3605	The first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the	229.16757202148438
905/3605	Well then said Aramis we must form a plan of	63.188812255859375
906/3605	As soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon	343.69287109375
907/3605	If they continue to advance we must fire	404.9390563964844
908/3605	We must fire as long as we have loaded	646.771728515625
909/3605	If those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a	709.183349609375
910/3605	Decidedly Athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside	213.8151397705078
911/3605	Gentlemen said Athos no divided attention I beg let each one pick out his	1228.9442138671875
912/3605	The four muskets made but one report but four men	229.2296600341797
913/3605	The drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging	2414.71630859375
914/3605	Then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same	1070.1484375
915/3605	Nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the Rochellais continued to advance in quick	524.3884887695312
916/3605	With every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slack	474.6298522949219
917/3605	Arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the	74.50977325439453
918/3605	A last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the	400.3719177246094
919/3605	Now my friends said Athos finish them at a	107.18535614013672
920/3605	Then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over   Can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said Ath	132.90037536621094
921/3605	My faith it appears so said DArtagn	36.226158142089844
922/3605	No cried Porthos there go three or four limping	437.2500915527344
923/3605	In fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the	373.72796630859375
924/3605	These were all who were left of the little	107.06903839111328
925/3605	Gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair	332.22894287109375
926/3605	Besides DArtagnan has not told us his idea	88.51832580566406
927/3605	And the Musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the	334.14593505859375
928/3605	Yes you said you had an idea said Ath	127.6786880493164
929/3605	Well I will go to England a second time I will go and find	91.4505615234375
930/3605	You shall not do that DArtagnan said Athos co	30.58081817626953
931/3605	And why not Have I not been there once   Yes but at that period we were not at	105.85581970214844
932/3605	At that period Buckingham was an ally and not an	478.2050476074219
933/3605	What you would now do amounts to	2615.83203125
934/3605	DArtagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was	46.67013931274414
935/3605	But said Porthos I think I have an idea in my	16.146780014038086
936/3605	Silence for Monsieur Porthoss idea said Aram	46.44245910644531
937/3605	I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent I am not very clever at pretext	92.91143798828125
938/3605	Milady does not know me I will get access to her without her suspecting me and when I catch my beauty I will strangle	184.76473999023438
939/3605	Well replied Athos I am not far from approving the idea of Monsieur Porth	59.55329132080078
940/3605	Kill a woman No listen to me I have the true	225.63101196289062
941/3605	Let us see your idea Aramis said Athos who felt much deference for the young Musket	176.46900939941406
942/3605	Ah my faith yes said Porthos and DArtagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it	33.70938491821289
943/3605	As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty said Aramis coloring I will take that upon	379.2588806152344
944/3605	I know a clever person at Tours   Aramis stopped on seeing Athos	247.55137634277344
945/3605	Well do you not adopt this means Athos said DArtagn	47.72250747680664
946/3605	Without reckoning objected Porthos that the queen would save Monsieur de Buckingham but would take no heed of	138.90234375
947/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan what Porthos says is full of	67.01806640625
948/3605	Ah ah but whats going on in the city yonder said Ath	142.5682373046875
949/3605	The four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached	274.5850524902344
950/3605	You see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said Ath	99.42635345458984
951/3605	You dont think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said Porth	118.93184661865234
952/3605	I feel myself quite in a humor for it and I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of	211.0821075439453
953/3605	Upon my word the drum draws near said DArtagn	145.65394592285156
954/3605	It is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hours journey from the city to	228.63427734375
955/3605	That is more than time enough for us to devise a	276.0355529785156
956/3605	If we go from this place we shall never find another so	138.60891723632812
957/3605	Ah stop I have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to	243.6015625
958/3605	Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable	754.9343872070312
959/3605	Athos made a sign for his lackey to	123.78678131103516
960/3605	Grimaud said Athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their	149.64430236816406
961/3605	And do you comprehend Grimaud said Aram	87.05369567871094
962/3605	Grimaud made a sign in the	82.36946868896484
963/3605	Thats all that is necessary said Athos now for my	120.49276733398438
964/3605	I should like however to comprehend said Porth	73.29862213134766
965/3605	Yes yes Athoss idea cried Aramis and DArtagnan at the same	34.310546875
966/3605	This Milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as I think you told me DArtagnan   Yes I know him very well and I also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sisterin	65.75824737548828
967/3605	If he detested her it would be all the better replied Ath	65.98033905029297
968/3605	In that case we are as well off as we	109.7266616821289
969/3605	And yet said Porthos I would like to know what Grimaud is	43.987762451171875
970/3605	What is her brotherinlaws name   Lord de	39.0312614440918
971/3605	Where is he now   He returned to London at the first sound of	68.05767822265625
972/3605	Well theres just the man we want said Ath	121.85283660888672
973/3605	It is he whom we must	109.2121810913086
974/3605	We will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of	163.8516387939453
975/3605	There is in London I hope some establishment like that of the Magdalens or of the Repentant D	1337.50244140625
976/3605	He must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in	145.251953125
977/3605	Yes said DArtagnan till she comes	40.48939514160156
978/3605	Ah my faith said Athos you require too much DArtagn	46.25870895385742
979/3605	I have given you all I have and I beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my	68.56977844238281
980/3605	But I think it would be still better said Aramis to inform the queen and Lord de Winter at the same	32.52525329589844
981/3605	Yes but who is to carry the letter to Tours and who to London   I answer for Bazin said Aram	100.6991958618164
982/3605	Ay said Porthos if we cannot leave the camp our lackeys	76.28392028808594
983/3605	To be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said Aram	153.8978729248047
984/3605	Give the lackeys money and they will	218.93394470214844
985/3605	We will give them money replied Ath	83.21028900146484
986/3605	Have you any money   The four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so	80.39897918701172
987/3605	Look out cried DArtagnan I see black points and red points moving y	487.4496765136719
988/3605	Why did you talk of a regiment Athos It is a veritable army   My faith yes said Athos there they	88.46739959716797
989/3605	See the sneaks come without drum or	12553.8447265625
990/3605	Ah ah have you finished Grimaud   Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque	65.50584411621094
991/3605	Some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in	739.9669799804688
992/3605	Bravo said Athos that does honor to your	301.4491882324219
993/3605	All very well said Porthos but I should like to	26.910152435302734
994/3605	Let us decamp first and you will understand	1447.4322509765625
995/3605	A moment gentlemen a moment give Grimaud time to clear away the	549.0206298828125
996/3605	Ah ah said Aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarg	991.0113525390625
997/3605	I am of DArtagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our	87.26985168457031
998/3605	My faith said Athos I have nothing to say against a	59.89989471435547
999/3605	We bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a	186.34097290039062
1000/3605	Nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off   Grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the	184.16151428222656
1001/3605	The four friends followed ten paces behind	190.6211700439453
1002/3605	What the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried Ath	83.90262603759766
1003/3605	The white flag _morbleu_ We must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a nap	236.95726013183594
1004/3605	And Athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures	530.2164916992188
1005/3605	But Athos might be said to bear a charmed	165.3965606689453
1006/3605	The balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck	393.282958984375
1007/3605	Athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the	217.0708465576172
1008/3605	On both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries of	1190.7127685546875
1009/3605	A second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a	1018.1068115234375
1010/3605	Cries were heard from the camp Come down come down   Athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with	248.03097534179688
1011/3605	Come along Athos come along cried DArtagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be	80.62456512451172
1012/3605	But Athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by	961.92138671875
1013/3605	Grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the	465.324951171875
1014/3605	At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusill	183.66481018066406
1015/3605	Whats that asked Porthos what are they firing at now I hear no balls whistle and I see nobody   They are firing at the corpses replied Ath	401.7364196777344
1016/3605	But the dead cannot return their	440.91827392578125
1017/3605	Certainly not They will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their	245.00950622558594
1018/3605	That renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much	1041.4205322265625
1019/3605	Oh I comprehend now said the astonished Porth	133.78411865234375
1020/3605	Thats lucky said Athos shrugging his	58.626792907714844
1021/3605	On their part the French on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of	379.76849365234375
1022/3605	At length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their	254.45950317382812
1023/3605	The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the bast	203.95196533203125
1024/3605	These Rochellais are bungling fellows said Athos how many have we killed of thema dozen   Or	1468.2559814453125
1025/3605	How many did we crush under the wall   Eight or	359.74676513671875
1026/3605	And in exchange for all that not even a scratch Ah but what is the matter with your hand DArtagnan It bleeds	228.94497680664062
1027/3605	A spent ball   Not even	464.60125732421875
1028/3605	What is it then   We have said that Athos loved DArtagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young	91.31600952148438
1029/3605	Only grazed a little replied DArtagnan my fingers were caught between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin was	322.6451721191406
1030/3605	That comes of wearing diamonds my master said Athos disdain	448.1973876953125
1031/3605	Ah to be sure cried Porthos there is a	37.380943298339844
1032/3605	Why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond   Stop a bit said Aram	232.67967224121094
1033/3605	Well thought of Porthos this time you have an	40.77846908569336
1034/3605	Undoubtedly said Porthos drawing himself up at Athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell	146.65240478515625
1035/3605	But said DArtagnan it is the queens	19.19573974609375
1036/3605	The stronger reason why it should be sold replied Ath	122.1332778930664
1037/3605	The queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham her lover nothing more	675.8162231445312
1038/3605	The queen saving us her friends nothing more	3264.333251953125
1039/3605	What says Monsieur the Abbé I dont ask Porthos his opinion has been	61.116477966308594
1040/3605	Why I think said Aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token DArtagnan may sell	203.8282012939453
1041/3605	My dear Aramis you speak like theology person	1762.9432373046875
1042/3605	Your advice then is   To sell the diamond replied Aram	98.85009765625
1043/3605	Well then said DArtagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about	66.36273193359375
1044/3605	The fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consci	942.3140258789062
1045/3605	My faith it was time that idea came into Porthoss	215.3328094482422
1046/3605	Here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this	167.7521514892578
1047/3605	We are observed they are coming to meet	176.60504150390625
1048/3605	In fact as we have said the whole camp was in	148.5643310546875
1049/3605	More than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friendsan undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real	438.927978515625
1050/3605	Nothing was heard but cries of Live the Musketeers Live the Guards	3053.870849609375
1051/3605	de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was	153.09085083007812
1052/3605	The dragoon and the Swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the	232.9138946533203
1053/3605	There was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochella	1204.3050537109375
1054/3605	The tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent La Houdinière his captain of the Guards to inquire what was going	627.4453735351562
1055/3605	The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of	1900.280029296875
1056/3605	Well asked the cardinal on seeing La Houdinière	1674.8822021484375
1057/3605	Well monseigneur replied the latter three Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion	164.25387573242188
1058/3605	Gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed I dont know how many Rochella	289.0811767578125
1059/3605	Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers   Yes monseign	67.38507080078125
1060/3605	What are their names   Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aram	46.46364974975586
1061/3605	Still my three brave fellows murmured the	305.2655029296875
1062/3605	Positively these four men must be on my	190.43466186523438
1063/3605	The same evening the cardinal spoke to	320.4710998535156
1064/3605	de Tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole	101.78010559082031
1065/3605	de Tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his Eminence not forgetting the episode of the nap	157.5363311767578
1066/3605	Thats well Monsieur de Tréville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to	91.87449645996094
1067/3605	I will have three _fleurdelis_ embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a	733.102294921875
1068/3605	de Tréville that will be unjust to the Guards	776.359619140625
1069/3605	Monsieur dArtagnan is not with me he serves under Monsieur Dessess	178.18276977539062
1070/3605	Well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same	91.10902404785156
1071/3605	de Tréville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and DArtagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next	144.83364868164062
1072/3605	We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musket	97.21808624267578
1073/3605	The three friends were likewise greatly	2213.697265625
1074/3605	My faith said DArtagnan to Athos you had a triumphant idea As you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest	144.54629516601562
1075/3605	Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of God we shall henceforth pass for cardinal	856.022705078125
1076/3605	That evening DArtagnan went to present his respects to	55.59382629394531
1077/3605	Dessessart and inform him of his	1129.9693603515625
1078/3605	Dessessart who esteemed DArtagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for	2980.776123046875
1079/3605	DArtagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into	150.29620361328125
1080/3605	Dessessarts valet came to DArtagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand liv	227.8065643310547
1081/3605	This was the price of the queens	61.22370147705078
1082/3605	A FAMILY AFFAIR     Athos had invented the phrase family	4454.03466796875
1083/3605	A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family affair concerned	695.913330078125
1084/3605	People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the	289.6459045410156
1085/3605	Therefore Athos had invented the phrase _family affair	1460.6563720703125
1086/3605	Aramis had discovered the idea _the lackeys	527.1987915039062
1087/3605	Porthos had discovered the means _the diamond	271.2796936035156
1088/3605	DArtagnan alone had discovered nothinghe ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed	183.1873321533203
1089/3605	Ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his	335.8661804199219
1090/3605	de Trévilles was as gay and cheerful as	637.5419921875
1091/3605	DArtagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as Aramis and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete	522.3114624023438
1092/3605	DArtagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the	99.4088134765625
1093/3605	After breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at Athoss lodging and there finish their	172.07077026367188
1094/3605	DArtagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeers uniform in every street of the	275.7782287597656
1095/3605	In the evening at the appointed hour the four friends	81.6720962524414
1096/3605	There only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to Miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at Tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the	542.5573120117188
1097/3605	Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his	515.7994995117188
1098/3605	Porthos boasted of the strength of Mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary	315.7262878417969
1099/3605	Aramis confiding in the address of Bazin made a pompous eulogium on his	475.30133056640625
1100/3605	Finally DArtagnan had entire faith in the bravery of Planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulog	141.3179931640625
1101/3605	These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too	546.5399780273438
1102/3605	Unfortunately said Athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities	613.5799560546875
1103/3605	But where is such a lackey to be found   Not to be found cried Ath	43.692161560058594
1104/3605	I know it well so take Grim	180.5250244140625
1105/3605	Planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the	237.62698364257812
1106/3605	Gentlemen said Aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the	342.06915283203125
1107/3605	What Aramis says is very sensible replied Athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their	281.260498046875
1108/3605	Monsieur Abbé you are a great moral	61.91281509399414
1109/3605	Doubtless said Aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys   Speak lower Aramis said Ath	214.52479553222656
1110/3605	Thats wisenot for the lackeys resumed Aramis but for the masterfor the _masters_ we may	686.5349731445312
1111/3605	Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us	214.89060974121094
1112/3605	Well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him	270.50634765625
1113/3605	Why good God you will be deceived just the same said Athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in	723.185546875
1114/3605	They will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from	216.70028686523438
1115/3605	Once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess	741.8807373046875
1116/3605	What the devil we are not	186.83218383789062
1117/3605	To reach EnglandAthos lowered his voiceall France covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be	1752.281005859375
1118/3605	A passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with English in order to ask the way to	281.52362060546875
1119/3605	Really I think the thing very	193.14212036132812
1120/3605	Not at all cried DArtagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary I think it very	39.565452575683594
1121/3605	It would be no doubt _parbleu_ if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal   Speak lower said Ath	91.91529083251953
1122/3605	of intrigues and secrets of state continued DArtagnan complying with the	325.9979248046875
1123/3605	I will write to him then nearly in these	165.42709350585938
1124/3605	Let us see said Athos assuming in advance a critical	351.752197265625
1125/3605	_Monsieur and dear friend_   Ah yes _Dear friend_ to an Englishman interrupted Athos well commenced Bravo DArtagnan Only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the	426.4321594238281
1126/3605	I will say then _Monsieur_ quite	137.14361572265625
1127/3605	You may even say _My Lord_ replied Athos who stickled for propri	1233.8017578125
1128/3605	_My Lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg_   Good _the Luxembourg_ One might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother Thats ingenious said Ath	602.786865234375
1129/3605	Well then we will put simply _My Lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared_   My dear DArtagnan you will never make anything but a very bad	183.3470001220703
1130/3605	_Where your life was spared_ For shame thats	15883.5078125
1131/3605	A man of spirit is not to be reminded of such	328.32061767578125
1132/3605	A benefit reproached is an offense	20194.39453125
1133/3605	The devil said DArtagnan you are insupport	71.41397857666016
1134/3605	If the letter must be written under your censure my faith I renounce the	1145.6942138671875
1135/3605	Handle the musket and the sword my dear	82.84123229980469
1136/3605	You will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to Monsieur Abb	263.49005126953125
1137/3605	Ay ay said Porthos pass the pen to Aramis who writes theses in	619.2769775390625
1138/3605	Draw up this note for us Aramis but by our Holy Father the Pope cut it short for I shall prune you in my turn I warn	261.869384765625
1139/3605	I ask no better said Aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the	176.9390869140625
1140/3605	I have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a h	707.7540283203125
1141/3605	I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the	186.22576904296875
1142/3605	But continued Aramis the details escape	530.4491577148438
1143/3605	DArtagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in	16.820993423461914
1144/3605	At length Athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to DArtagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to	115.47813415527344
1145/3605	Because she had been branded continued DArtagn	190.5479278564453
1146/3605	Impossible What do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed  	149.6791229248047
1147/3605	And her husband found out that she had a _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder cried Porth	369.1202087402344
1148/3605	These three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos each with a sadder inton	313.0203857421875
1149/3605	And who has seen this _fleurdelis_ inquired Aram	1164.0159912109375
1150/3605	Or rather to observe the chronological order I and DArtagnan replied Ath	206.57069396972656
1151/3605	And does the husband of this frightful creature still live said Aram	150.76254272460938
1152/3605	Are you quite sure of it   I am	23.84544563293457
1153/3605	There was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his	198.87367248535156
1154/3605	This time said Athos first breaking the silence DArtagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at	155.94007873535156
1155/3605	The devil You are right Athos said Aramis and it is a rather difficult	76.88761138916016
1156/3605	The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very	997.7509765625
1157/3605	Never mind Be silent I will	1032.946044921875
1158/3605	As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important	438.86456298828125
1159/3605	Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in	221.2546844482422
1160/3605	But the third time which is the present you may	403.4903564453125
1161/3605	Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the	385.5897216796875
1162/3605	Watch her arrival for she has great and terrible	574.0247802734375
1163/3605	If you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left	366.78143310546875
1164/3605	Well now that will do wonderfully well said Ath	325.2364807128906
1165/3605	My dear Aramis you have the pen of a secretary of	81.3209457397461
1166/3605	Lord de Winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be	117.43017578125
1167/3605	I have the price and DArtagnan threw the bag upon the	37.232818603515625
1168/3605	At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes and Porthos	39.13728713989258
1169/3605	How much in that little bag   Seven thousand livres in louis of twelve franc	301.21759033203125
1170/3605	That poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres   It appears so said Athos since here they	122.72465515136719
1171/3605	I dont suppose that our friend DArtagnan has added any of his own to the	69.46574401855469
1172/3605	But gentlemen in all this said DArtagnan we do not think of the	23.186294555664062
1173/3605	Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear	1495.920166015625
1174/3605	That is the least we owe	287.2662353515625
1175/3605	Thats true said Athos but that concerns Aram	123.55573272705078
1176/3605	Well replied the latter blushing what must I say   Oh thats simple enough replied Ath	88.30652618408203
1177/3605	Write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at	620.7777099609375
1178/3605	Aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his	145.7729034423828
1179/3605	This clever person is your relative then   Cousing	11970.0673828125
1180/3605	It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even arrive in sight of the	339.41668701171875
1181/3605	I will even venture to say that I am certain	67.90169525146484
1182/3605	de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great	410.3244934082031
1183/3605	His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to	841.0404052734375
1184/3605	He would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded	465.1867370605469
1185/3605	Give these happy tidings to your sister my dear	351.0777282714844
1186/3605	I have dreamed that the unlucky Englishman was	256.1891784667969
1187/3605	I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this I am sure I have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive	191.5999755859375
1188/3605	Be assured then of seeing me soon	849.9599609375
1189/3605	Capital cried Athos you are the king of poets my dear Aram	91.06854248046875
1190/3605	You speak like the Apocalypse and you are as true as the	400.1280212402344
1191/3605	There is nothing now to do but to put the address to this	125.67385864257812
1192/3605	He folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote   _To Ml	634.709228515625
1193/3605	The three friends looked at one another and laughed they were	163.42434692382812
1194/3605	Now said Aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that Bazin alone can carry this letter to	223.7296905517578
1195/3605	My cousin knows nobody but Bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would	1817.6929931640625
1196/3605	Besides Bazin is ambitious and learned Bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept	2717.709228515625
1197/3605	Well as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn or at least a	141.13099670410156
1198/3605	You can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than	344.2835388183594
1199/3605	Very well said DArtagnan I consent to Bazin with all my heart but grant me Planc	49.41347885131836
1200/3605	Milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his	881.5372314453125
1201/3605	Now Planchet has an excellent memory and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to	254.5885009765625
1202/3605	If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements Aramis those of London are	1019.1998291015625
1203/3605	I request then that Planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to London with me and knows how to speak correctly _London sir if you please and my master Lord DArtagnan	242.7534637451172
1204/3605	With that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and	163.4217071533203
1205/3605	In that case said Athos Planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and Bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand liv	149.99270629882812
1206/3605	We will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common	305.4172058105469
1207/3605	Will that do   My dear Athos said Aramis you speak like Nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the	120.6987533569336
1208/3605	Well then said Athos it is	40.35563659667969
1209/3605	Everything considered I am not sorry to retain Grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and I am	117.1235580444336
1210/3605	Yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him	564.660400390625
1211/3605	Planchet was sent for and instructions were given	153.8516387939453
1212/3605	The matter had been named to him by DArtagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the	69.80191040039062
1213/3605	I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said Planchet and if I am taken I will swallow	141.94052124023438
1214/3605	Well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said DArtagn	26.77716064453125
1215/3605	You will give me a copy this evening which I shall know by heart	124.36161041259766
1216/3605	DArtagnan looked at his friends as if to say Well what did I tell you   Now continued he addressing Planchet you have eight days to get an interview with Lord de Winter you have eight days to returnin all sixteen	80.23736572265625
1217/3605	If on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past	151.81007385253906
1218/3605	Then monsieur said Planchet you must buy me a	20.120193481445312
1219/3605	Take this said Athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good	181.3010711669922
1220/3605	Remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your masters head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for	335.3566589355469
1221/3605	But remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to DArtagnan I will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your	276.5240478515625
1222/3605	Oh monsieur said Planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the Musket	101.63208770751953
1223/3605	And I said Porthos rolling his large eyes remember I will skin you	439.2470703125
1224/3605	Ah monsieur   And I said Aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that I will roast you at a slow fire like a	127.21294403076172
1225/3605	Ah monsieur   Planchet began to	16.387428283691406
1226/3605	We will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely	397.7139587402344
1227/3605	See Planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like	179.9989013671875
1228/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet I will succeed or I will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will	90.2933349609375
1229/3605	It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by	51.25676727294922
1230/3605	He gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight oclock in the	130.14707946777344
1231/3605	In the morning as he was mounting his horse DArtagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took Planchet	108.8780517578125
1232/3605	When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it you will further say to him _Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham for they wish to assassinate him	437.16253662109375
1233/3605	But this Planchet is so serious and important that I have not informed my friends that I would entrust this secret to you and for a captains commission I would not write	170.8302459716797
1234/3605	Be satisfied monsieur said Planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in	49.90876770019531
1235/3605	Bazin set out the next day for Tours and was allowed eight days for performing his	440.3772277832031
1236/3605	The four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the h	268.47918701171875
1237/3605	Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who	211.08847045898438
1238/3605	More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected	674.7281494140625
1239/3605	They had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety Milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very	427.0517883300781
1240/3605	The four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was	352.1946105957031
1241/3605	It is true however that it was the shorter and easier	462.4105529785156
1242/3605	Aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orth	233.59046936035156
1243/3605	Good God cried he laughing I quite despair of my poor Michon she will never write like Monsieur de Vo	227.02828979492188
1244/3605	What does you mean by boor Michon said the Swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter	205.9720916748047
1245/3605	Oh _pardieu_ less than nothing said Aramis a charming little seamstress whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few lines as a sort of keeps	431.4541015625
1246/3605	The duvil said the Swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade   Aramis read the letter and passed it to Ath	339.1984558105469
1247/3605	See what she writes to me Athos said	235.83094787597656
1248/3605	Adieu Take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken	220.0454559326172
1249/3605	MARIE MICHON     And what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the	986.4579467773438
1250/3605	Yez whats the dream said the	1138.608154296875
1251/3605	Well _pardieu_ said Aramis it was only this I had a dream and I related it to	51.667179107666016
1252/3605	Yez yez said the Swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but I neffer	4731.33056640625
1253/3605	You are very fortunate said Athos rising I wish I could say as much   Neffer replied the Swiss enchanted that a man like Athos could envy him	241.52186584472656
1254/3605	Neffer neffer   DArtagnan seeing Athos rise did likewise took his arm and went	178.7279510498047
1255/3605	Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the	118.30503845214844
1256/3605	As to Bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the Swiss he dreamed that Aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals	133.2575225830078
1257/3605	But as we have said Bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four	103.73405456542969
1258/3605	The days of expectation are long and DArtagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour	393.318359375
1259/3605	He forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of Mil	764.4625854492188
1260/3605	He credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that Planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his	218.8075714111328
1261/3605	Still further his confidence in the worthy Picard at one time so great diminished day by	1673.1572265625
1262/3605	This anxiety became so great that it even extended to Aramis and Porth	116.59791564941406
1263/3605	Athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary	511.2344665527344
1264/3605	On the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in DArtagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was	151.82455444335938
1265/3605	Really said Athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so And what does it amount to after all To be	267.3837890625
1266/3605	Well but we should be taken out of prison Madame Bonacieux was	177.05194091796875
1267/3605	Wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest Planchet will be	130.71722412109375
1268/3605	He promised to be here and I have very great faith in Planchet who appears to me to be a very good	66.16732788085938
1269/3605	But if he does not come said DArtagn	12.997804641723633
1270/3605	Well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed thats	105.4028091430664
1271/3605	He may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarr	340.7456359863281
1272/3605	Eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a	1768.54248046875
1273/3605	Be philosophers as I am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us	135.4046173095703
1274/3605	Nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambert	1361.8203125
1275/3605	Thats all very well replied DArtagnan but I am tired of fearing when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of Mil	87.42513275146484
1276/3605	You are very fastidious said Athos such a beautiful woman   A woman of mark said Porthos with his loud	51.087074279785156
1277/3605	Athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not rep	95.62919616699219
1278/3605	The day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it	547.1104736328125

1284/3605	You mean to say we _have lost_ said Athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the	143.9414520263672
1285/3605	Come gentlemen said he they are beating the	1103.9027099609375
1286/3605	Let us to bed   And Athos went out of the Parpaillot followed by DArtagn	55.275146484375
1287/3605	Aramis came behind giving his arm to Porth	138.2822723388672
1288/3605	Aramis mumbled verses to himself and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of	301.2842102050781
1289/3605	But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to DArtagnan and a wellknown voice said Monsieur I have brought your cloak it is chilly this	94.70930480957031
1290/3605	Planchet cried DArtagnan beside himself with	23.14285659790039
1291/3605	Well yes Planchet to be sure said Athos what is there so astonishing in that He promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is	113.2654800415039
1292/3605	Bravo Planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master I will promise you a place in my	84.85631561279297
1293/3605	Oh no never said Planchet I will never leave Monsieur dArtagn	19.424257278442383
1294/3605	At the same time DArtagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his	46.804725646972656
1295/3605	DArtagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passersby and he restrained	151.06153869628906
1296/3605	I have the note said he to Athos and to his	48.30618667602539
1297/3605	Thats well said Athos let us go home and read	84.77616119384766
1298/3605	The note burned the hand of DArtagn	76.25501251220703
1299/3605	He wished to hasten their steps but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his	73.78553771972656
1300/3605	At length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised DArtagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected	125.09368896484375
1301/3605	It contained half a line in a hand perfectly British and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan   _Thank you be easy	1411.8995361328125
1302/3605	Athos took the letter from the hands of DArtagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a c	100.03801727294922
1303/3605	Then calling Planchet he said Now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as	180.3520050048828
1304/3605	I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said Planc	147.69384765625
1305/3605	Well cried DArtagnan tell us all about	15.768814086914062
1306/3605	You are right Planchet said Athos besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the	221.44602966308594
1307/3605	Go to bed Planchet and sleep sound	190.96868896484375
1308/3605	My faith monsieur that will be the first time I have done so for sixteen	59.49224090576172
1309/3605	Well if you will have the truth and me too said Ath	74.0095443725586
1310/3605	But the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept	2851.013916015625
1311/3605	Nine days after leaving the Charente pale with fatigue and vexation Milady saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre	2140.409912109375
1312/3605	She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three	107.17350006103516
1313/3605	Add another day for landing and that would make	314.44439697265625
1314/3605	Add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in	1312.83544921875
1315/3605	She reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against	267.5372009277344
1316/3605	She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of	741.7590942382812
1317/3605	Milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France the messenger of his Eminence entered the port in	439.9706726074219
1318/3605	All the city was agitated by an extraordinary	376.52392578125
1319/3605	Four large vessels recently built had just been	2233.913330078125
1320/3605	It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England remembers that there is a	402.90130615234375
1321/3605	They entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the	817.4916381835938
1322/3605	This boat contained an officer a mate and eight row	3477.86181640625
1323/3605	The officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the	150.57366943359375
1324/3605	The officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon	343.7561340332031
1325/3605	When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without	935.1146850585938
1326/3605	Then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to Milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to	165.3812713623047
1327/3605	He then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed	220.4757537841797
1328/3605	Then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six	1497.51025390625
1329/3605	The boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous	392.9417724609375
1330/3605	During the examination of Milady by the officer as may well be imagined Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her	191.3383026123047
1331/3605	But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her	330.142822265625
1332/3605	The officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twentyfive or twentysix years of	57.9288215637207
1333/3605	When they entered the port it was already	278.93695068359375
1334/3605	The fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become	1036.4080810546875
1335/3605	The air they breathed was heavy damp and	3924.63720703125
1336/3605	Milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of	407.7911071777344
1337/3605	The officer desired to have Miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the	503.8370361328125
1338/3605	When this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his	509.3630065917969
1339/3605	Milady looked at this man and	259.33984375
1340/3605	Who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account   You may perceive madame by my uniform that I am an officer in the English navy replied the young	113.67697143554688
1341/3605	These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calm	130.53285217285156
1342/3605	Nevertheless they had not the power of convincing Mil	180.5100555419922
1343/3605	But I am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester my name is Lady Clarik and this measure   This measure is general madame and you will seek in vain to evade	406.8289489746094
1344/3605	Accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat	100.77417755126953
1345/3605	A large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside	201.67372131347656
1346/3605	The eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the	141.0456085205078
1347/3605	In five minutes they gained the	178.7717742919922
1348/3605	The officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to Mil	190.44400024414062
1349/3605	Is this carriage for us asked Mil	875.9417114257812
1350/3605	The hôtel then is far away   At the other end of the	88.30437469482422
1351/3605	Very well said Milady and she resolutely entered the	622.93701171875
1352/3605	The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside Milady and shut the	290.3802185058594
1353/3605	Immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the	232.2557830810547
1354/3605	At the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being	76.0513687133789
1355/3605	Houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one	389.8545227050781
1356/3605	But we are no longer in the city sir said	54.65126037597656
1357/3605	I beg you to understand sir I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking	94.96141052246094
1358/3605	Oh this is too much cried Mil	123.97457885742188
1359/3605	Help help   No voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a	312.7686767578125
1360/3605	Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the	249.60633850097656
1361/3605	Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself	120.16886901855469
1362/3605	Take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in	123.00639343261719
1363/3605	The officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost	486.01556396484375
1364/3605	Then you dont know me sir   It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing	15.614171981811523
1365/3605	And on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me   None I swear to	40.3274040222168
1366/3605	There was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that Milady felt	270.9690246582031
1367/3605	At length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and	586.9954833984375
1368/3605	Then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel Milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep	876.66162109375
1369/3605	The carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and	1463.59423828125
1370/3605	Almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to Milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calm	77.20610046386719
1371/3605	Still then I am a prisoner said Milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but I feel assured it will not be for long added	103.22956085205078
1372/3605	My own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of	518.9651489257812
1373/3605	However flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different mod	1108.282958984375
1374/3605	Immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach	1195.5462646484375
1375/3605	Then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the	136.9193572998047
1376/3605	She with a stillsmiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of	456.8895568847656
1377/3605	They then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for Mil	202.86370849609375
1378/3605	With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest	268.6724548339844
1379/3605	It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the	330.1036071777344
1380/3605	In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate	356.8459167480469
1381/3605	But no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without	587.9602661132812
1382/3605	The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness Milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his	343.7962646484375
1383/3605	It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become	637.5839233398438
1384/3605	At length Milady could hold out no longer she broke the	626.0067138671875
1385/3605	In the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing Put an end to my doubts I have courage enough for any danger I can foresee for every misfortune which I	293.3460998535156
1386/3605	Where am I and why am I here If I am free why these bars and these doors If I am a prisoner what crime have I committed   You are here in the apartment destined for you mad	175.27565002441406
1387/3605	I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this	91.07744598388672
1388/3605	This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a	114.82653045654297
1389/3605	There terminates at least to the present moment the duty I had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another	878.8561401367188
1390/3605	And who is that other person asked Milady warm	529.1342163085938
1391/3605	Can you not tell me his name   At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the	80.04415893554688
1392/3605	Some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the	189.90814208984375
1393/3605	That person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of	139.1114044189453
1394/3605	At the same time the door opened a man appeared on the	29.857013702392578
1395/3605	He was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his	87.62081909179688
1396/3605	Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a	133.20262145996094
1397/3605	The stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp Milady involuntarily drew	490.4903259277344
1398/3605	Then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor What my brother is it you   Yes fair lady replied Lord de Winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is I	152.2816925048828
1399/3605	But this castle then   Is	130.13194274902344
1400/3605	I am then your prisoner   Nearly	113.6812515258789
1401/3605	But this is a frightful abuse of power   No highsounding words Let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to	664.307373046875
1402/3605	Then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he	54.0967903137207
1403/3605	All is well I thank you now leave us alone	406.9160461425781
1404/3605	She knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrig	432.1694030761719
1405/3605	She rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been	826.197265625
1406/3605	This supposition appeared to her most	389.462646484375
1407/3605	It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the	96.29792022705078
1408/3605	At all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent	267.64910888671875
1409/3605	Yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future	231.80978393554688
1410/3605	You have then decided to come to England again said Lord de Winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to set your feet on British ground   Milady replied to this question by another	264.8228454589844
1411/3605	Ah to see me said de Winter cunning	635.319091796875
1412/3605	What is there astonishing in that   And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me  	59.4002571105957
1413/3605	So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the Channel   For you	122.27242279052734
1414/3605	The deuce What tenderness my sister   But am I not your nearest relative demanded Milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuous	450.852294921875
1415/3605	And my only heir are you not said Lord de Winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of Mil	77.03914642333984
1416/3605	Whatever command she had over herself Milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape	155.7648468017578
1417/3605	In fact the blow was direct and	624.813232421875
1418/3605	The first idea that occurred to Miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her	315.4707336425781
1419/3605	She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon DArtagnan when he spared the life of her	106.5656509399414
1420/3605	I do not understand my Lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak	183.4706573486328
1421/3605	What do you mean to say Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words   Oh my God no said Lord de Winter with apparent good	112.74468231201172
1422/3605	You wish to see me and you come to	64.433837890625
1423/3605	What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me   No what I think astonishing is that you should expect my	69.37028503417969
1424/3605	And yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear	66.13215637207031
1425/3605	Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers I am commandant of the	286.4735412597656
1426/3605	My heart told me what your mouth has just confirmedthat is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this momentand I sent my cutter to meet	405.015869140625
1427/3605	Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied and she was the more	577.7401123046875
1428/3605	My brother continued she was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived  	174.15420532226562
1429/3605	Ah I can understand how the sight of him struck you replied Lord de	116.33767700195312
1430/3605	You came from a country where he must be very much talked of and I know that his armaments against France greatly engage the attention of your friend the	263.41265869140625
1431/3605	My friend the cardinal cried Milady seeing that on this point as on the other Lord de Winter seemed well	258.14788818359375
1432/3605	Is he not your friend replied the baron neglig	192.9315185546875
1433/3605	Ah pardon I thought so but we will return to my Lord Duke	659.7354736328125
1434/3605	Let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had	1241.18310546875
1435/3605	You came you say to see me  	48.155086517333984
1436/3605	Well I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every	50.13191223144531
1437/3605	Am I then to remain here eternally demanded Milady with a certain	359.62359619140625
1438/3605	Do you find yourself badly lodged sister Demand anything you want and I will hasten to have you furnished with	671.3734130859375
1439/3605	But I have neither my women nor my	169.0173797607422
1440/3605	Tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although I am only your brotherinlaw I will arrange one	282.4868469238281
1441/3605	My first husband cried Milady looking at Lord de Winter with eyes almost starting from their	262.2291259765625
1442/3605	If you have forgotten as he is still living I can write to him and he will send me information on the	72.02397155761719
1443/3605	A cold sweat burst from the brow of Mil	138.68447875976562
1444/3605	You jest said she in a hollow	150.9757080078125
1445/3605	Do I look so asked the baron rising and going a step	212.26193237304688
1446/3605	Or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her	605.1510009765625
1447/3605	I insult you said Lord de Winter with	182.31277465820312
1448/3605	In truth madame do you think that can be possible   Indeed sir said Milady you must be either drunk or	111.97616577148438
1449/3605	Leave the room and send me a	148.54782104492188
1450/3605	Cannot I serve you as a waiting maid By that means all our secrets will remain in the	664.6984252929688
1451/3605	Insolent cried Milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his	238.52008056640625
1452/3605	I know you are accustomed to assassinate people but I warn you I shall defend myself even against	99.66283416748047
1453/3605	You have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a	153.29510498046875
1454/3605	Perhaps so and I have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you I	79.58737182617188
1455/3605	And the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of Milady which he almost touched with his	188.25201416015625
1456/3605	Milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a	355.5189514160156
1457/3605	Oh growl as much as you please cried Lord de Winter but dont try to bite for I warn you that it would be to your	110.85604095458984
1458/3605	There are here no procurators who regulate successions	20950.759765625
1459/3605	And these judges I warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders	233.60684204101562
1460/3605	The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole	493.6011657714844
1461/3605	Not a penny of what I possess will pass into your	177.06459045410156
1462/3605	I will be silent but you must endure your captivity	219.62782287597656
1463/3605	In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the	169.65826416015625
1464/3605	And be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the	197.13275146484375
1465/3605	Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed	454.5710754394531
1466/3605	Yes at present continued Lord de Winter you will remain in this	108.88054656982422
1467/3605	The walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window opens immediately over the	1727.1968994140625
1468/3605	The men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the	333.0809020996094
1469/3605	Even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to	251.64224243164062
1470/3605	A step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired	446.3891296386719
1471/3605	If they kill you English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it	323.8555908203125
1472/3605	Ah I see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its	1807.3233642578125
1473/3605	You are saying to yourself Fifteen days twenty days Bah I have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to	2707.41357421875
1474/3605	Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from	164.86129760742188
1475/3605	Ah try it   Milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except	828.8663330078125
1476/3605	Lord de Winter continued The officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know	217.30087280273438
1477/3605	He knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not I am sure come from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him	206.5389862060547
1478/3605	What do you say of him Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute You have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but I give you leave to try them upon this	353.53680419921875
1479/3605	_Pardieu_ if you succeed with him I pronounce you the demon	246.1820068359375
1480/3605	He went toward the door and opened it	60.831111907958984
1481/3605	Wait a minute longer and I will introduce him to	95.7425308227539
1482/3605	There followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard	251.32626342773438
1483/3605	Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the bar	95.87287139892578
1484/3605	Come in my dear John said Lord de Winter come in and shut the	172.9803009033203
1485/3605	Now said the baron look at this	46.53749465942383
1486/3605	She is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly sed	8108.10107421875
1487/3605	Well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribun	165.77064514160156
1488/3605	Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promisesI must do her that	2813.417724609375
1489/3605	She will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill	372.6508483886719
1490/3605	I have extricated you from misery Felton I have caused you to be named lieutenant I once saved your life you know on what	382.78741455078125
1491/3605	I am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a	100.89698028564453
1492/3605	This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my	196.5010528564453
1493/3605	I hold this serpent in my	382.3193359375
1494/3605	Well I call you and say to you Friend Felton John my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this	1253.5965576171875
1495/3605	Swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has mer	763.0280151367188
1496/3605	John Felton I trust your word John Felton I put faith in your loyalty   My Lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my Lord I swear all shall be done as you	357.575927734375
1497/3605	Milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful count	266.25030517578125
1498/3605	Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a	783.157958984375
1499/3605	She is not to leave this chamber understand John continued the bar	254.46713256835938
1500/3605	She is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but youif you will do her the honor to address a word to	208.4498291015625
1501/3605	That is sufficient my Lord I have	362.0701904296875
1502/3605	And now madame try to make your peace with God for you are judged by men   Milady let her head sink as if crushed by this	389.2660217285156
1503/3605	Lord de Winter went out making a sign to Felton who followed him shutting the door after	337.4601135253906
1504/3605	One instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his	230.49801635742188
1505/3605	OFFICER     Meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England but no news arrived that was not annoying and	361.12945556640625
1506/3605	Although La Rochelle was invested however certain success might appearthanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged citythe blockade might last a long time	1099.0894775390625
1507/3605	This was a great affront to the kings army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil Louis	150.63485717773438
1508/3605	with Anne of Austriafor that affair was overbut he had to adjust matters for	957.585693359375
1509/3605	de Bassompierre who was embroiled with the Duc dAngoulê	1269.1781005859375
1510/3605	As to Monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing	123.5296401977539
1511/3605	The city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender the mayor had hanged the mutine	970.7601318359375
1512/3605	This execution quieted the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strang	1082.65966796875
1513/3605	On their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham or the spies which Buckingham sent to the Rochella	824.0459594726562
1514/3605	In one case or the other the trial was soon	408.7810974121094
1515/3605	The cardinal pronounced the single word Hanged The king was invited to come and see the	1174.6109619140625
1516/3605	He came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the	418.1756591796875
1517/3605	Nevertheless time passed on and the Rochellais did not	540.8058471679688
1518/3605	The last spy that was taken was the bearer of a	179.8318634033203
1519/3605	The Rochellais then had no hope but in	859.3812866210938
1520/3605	It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham their courage would fail with their	378.9810485839844
1521/3605	The cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not	223.45504760742188
1522/3605	The question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always	705.7899169921875
1523/3605	In the first place La Rochelle appeared impregn	183.5557098388672
1524/3605	Then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which Frenchman would combat against Frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of	783.5792846679688
1525/3605	In fact the sack of La Rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of	652.649658203125
1526/3605	Bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good Catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsLa Rochelle is impregnable except to	1422.989501953125
1527/3605	The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a	388.8080139160156
1528/3605	And yet he reckoned and with reason on Mil	550.7396240234375
1529/3605	He resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate	271.39910888671875
1530/3605	He continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Roc	545.1708984375
1531/3605	Meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of Louis	778.9171142578125
1532/3605	his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of Robespierre he repeated this maxim of Tristans gossip Divide in order to	1382.9249267578125
1533/3605	when besieging Paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the	7460.75439453125
1534/3605	The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the Rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their	1289.190673828125
1535/3605	Up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it	1166.7027587890625
1536/3605	These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal	332.79351806640625
1537/3605	Still further Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against France and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English Imperial and Spanish	456.8927917480469
1538/3605	This letter was read publicly in all parts of the	347.66162109375
1539/3605	Copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously	373.09393310546875
1540/3605	This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieus former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the	183.25967407226562
1541/3605	During this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the	727.3234252929688
1542/3605	All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and ga	7867.8046875
1543/3605	Four of these men were our Musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just	142.41427612304688
1544/3605	This letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drum	605.069580078125
1545/3605	The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure wine these were the lackeys of these	1423.9879150390625
1546/3605	The cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in	487.574951171875
1547/3605	Besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of	790.4743041992188
1548/3605	It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this	114.1881332397461
1549/3605	You are speaking you scoundrel said Athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming	264.7509765625
1550/3605	Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his	401.5525817871094
1551/3605	With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet and saluted with	178.3161163330078
1552/3605	It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard said	613.2000122070312
1553/3605	Lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentin	388.3446044921875
1554/3605	Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting	217.05470275878906
1555/3605	DArtagnan continued Athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to Monseigneur here it is avail yourself of	116.22921752929688
1556/3605	These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished Athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by	237.4859619140625
1557/3605	DArtagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the	72.58654022216797
1558/3605	It does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which Athos had started it does not signify	222.3479461669922
1559/3605	I do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody	402.86517333984375
1560/3605	Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of ass	307.7165222167969
1561/3605	Then he resumed in his turn Discipline Monseigneur has I hope in no way been forgotten by	406.8200378417969
1562/3605	We are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we	163.16864013671875
1563/3605	If we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your Eminence we are ready to obey	101.0011978149414
1564/3605	Your Eminence may perceive continued Athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our	246.3622589111328
1565/3605	And he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and	205.3268585205078
1566/3605	Your Eminence may believe added DArtagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward us with so few	104.57322692871094
1567/3605	The cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a	247.0189971923828
1568/3605	Do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the	116.85478210449219
1569/3605	Oh as to that Monseigneur it is true said Athos we do conspire as your Eminence might have seen the other	100.45719146728516
1570/3605	Ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me	222.18197631835938
1571/3605	The color mounted to the face of Athos and he made a step toward his Emin	97.432861328125
1572/3605	One might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrog	338.8008117675781
1573/3605	If it be so we trust your Eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real	296.29205322265625
1574/3605	And if it were an interrogatory replied the	184.41732788085938
1575/3605	Others besides you have undergone such Monsieur Athos and have replied	547.1806640625
1576/3605	Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to	117.9814453125
1577/3605	What was that letter you were about to read Monsieur Aramis and which you so promptly concealed   A womans letter monseign	67.21924591064453
1578/3605	Ah yes I see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know I have taken	99.84505462646484
1579/3605	Monseigneur said Athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a womans letter but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme nor Madame dAigu	409.2893981933594
1580/3605	The cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his	394.783203125
1581/3605	He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdini	1260.2750244140625
1582/3605	Athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be	203.33932495117188
1583/3605	The cardinalists were three the Musketeers lackeys included were	1862.775390625
1584/3605	He judged that the match would be so much the less equal if Athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a	387.04315185546875
1585/3605	Well well said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in	359.0665588378906
1586/3605	We can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over	536.3992309570312
1587/3605	Gentlemen I have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red Dove	758.6856079101562
1588/3605	If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am going I would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your	172.31085205078125
1589/3605	Adieu gentlemen   And remounting his horse which Cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode	335.2389831542969
1590/3605	The four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had	78.10735321044922
1591/3605	The countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his Eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his	242.07192993164062
1592/3605	Athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful	656.9826049804688
1593/3605	When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight That Grimaud kept bad watch cried Porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on	171.56019592285156
1594/3605	Grimaud was about to reply to excuse	254.13719177246094
1595/3605	Athos lifted his finger and Grimaud was	356.9020690917969
1596/3605	Would you have given up the letter Aramis said DArtagn	24.405628204345703
1597/3605	I said Aramis in his most flutelike tone I had made up my	191.9525909423828
1598/3605	If he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him I would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other I would have run my sword through his	65.52693176269531
1599/3605	I expected as much said Athos and that was why I threw myself between you and	127.32825469970703
1600/3605	Indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and	184.5269317626953
1601/3605	My dear Athos I admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after	96.63867950439453
1602/3605	One might have supposed the Bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic Medusa had converted you into	641.1427001953125
1603/3605	Is being in love conspiring You are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the	117.42312622070312
1604/3605	Thats a match you are playing with his Eminence this letter is your	387.4423522949219
1605/3605	Why should you expose your game to your adversary That is never	525.5366821289062
1606/3605	Let him find it out if he can We can find out his   Well thats all very sensible Athos said DArtagn	73.06266021728516
1607/3605	In that case let there be no more question of whats past and let Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted	258.2957763671875
1608/3605	Aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine	512.4013061523438
1609/3605	You had only read a line or two said DArtagnan read the letter again from the	79.02802276611328
1610/3605	Nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be I believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of	154.38775634765625
1611/3605	Meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her	303.92431640625
1612/3605	I know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as I have given you proofs my dear cousin I am not unskilled in such affairs and I will take charge of the	341.28155517578125
1613/3605	My sister thanks you for your good and eternal	973.0922241210938
1614/3605	She has experienced much anxiety but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen	387.62640380859375
1615/3605	Tell us news of yourself as often as you     can that is to say as often as you can with	140.07089233398438
1616/3605	I embrace    	81.59230041503906
1617/3605	MARIE MICHON     Oh what do I not owe you Aramis said DArtagn	282.79156494140625
1618/3605	Dear Constance I have at length then intelligence of	856.1280517578125
1619/3605	She lives she is in safety in a convent she is at Béthune Where is Béthune Athos   Why upon the frontiers of Artois and of F	754.9642333984375
1620/3605	The siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that	114.7001724243164
1621/3605	And that will not be long it is to be hoped said Porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were reduced to the leather of their	237.13381958007812
1622/3605	Supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles I cannot see much that is left unless they eat one	700.6320190429688
1623/3605	Why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket   Yes said DArtagnan Athos is right it must be	116.57567596435547
1624/3605	And yet if we burn it who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes   He must have one said Ath	177.09507751464844
1625/3605	What will you do with the letter then asked Porth	30.988567352294922
1626/3605	As a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of	165.67465209960938
1627/3605	Grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed	147.0394287109375
1628/3605	Bravo Monsieur Grimaud said Athos and now take	65.81104278564453
1629/3605	Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less	961.07275390625
1630/3605	And now said Athos unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up Grimaud I think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the	283.7432556152344
1631/3605	Meantime his Eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches These four men must positively be	1827.103271484375
1632/3605	CAPTIVITY THE FIRST DAY     Let us return to Milady whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France has made us lose sight of for an	685.8351440429688
1633/3605	We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflectiona dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she	401.5089111328125
1634/3605	On two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her that she has	889.3587036132812
1635/3605	DArtagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of	438.2426452636719
1636/3605	He has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her	768.5521240234375
1637/3605	Still more he has lifted the corner of her maskthat shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so	276.7225646972656
1638/3605	DArtagnan has turned aside from Buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him in the person of the	158.43968200683594
1639/3605	DArtagnan had passed himself upon her as De Wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her	440.726806640625
1640/3605	DArtagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without	140.60958862304688
1641/3605	All this she owes to DArtagnan without	142.17184448242188
1642/3605	From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from him He alone could have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of	388.874755859375
1643/3605	Bonacieux against Buckingham but above all against DArtagnanprojects lost in the distance of the	215.03811645507812
1644/3605	Yes but in order to avenge herself she must be	78.73936462402344
1645/3605	And to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floorall undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give	631.521240234375
1646/3605	Besides to do all this time is necessarymonths years and she has ten or twelve days as Lord de Winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told	372.2807312011719
1647/3605	But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in rep	2347.634033203125
1648/3605	Go to go to I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate	191.1087188720703
1649/3605	No violence violence is the proof of	662.339111328125
1650/3605	In the first place I have never succeeded by that	68.70062255859375
1651/3605	Perhaps if I employed my strength against women I might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them but it is with men that I struggle and I am but a woman to	373.3895263671875
1652/3605	Let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my	175.41737365722656
1653/3605	Then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her	509.82275390625
1654/3605	At length she murmured satisfied with herself Come nothing is lost I am still	567.7951049804688
1655/3605	It was then nearly eight oclock in the	31.9011173248291
1656/3605	Milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her	234.2808380126953
1657/3605	A better idea however came into her mind before going to	656.8908081054688
1658/3605	She had heard something said about	1836.2872314453125
1659/3605	She had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a rep	248.4972686767578
1660/3605	The prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was	251.9391632080078
1661/3605	A light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jail	290.4465637207031
1662/3605	Milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging	455.49517822265625
1663/3605	The bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its	778.2158203125
1664/3605	Steps sounded in the chamber and drew	140.8941650390625
1665/3605	Place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of Fel	398.85595703125
1666/3605	You will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued Fel	2276.5302734375
1667/3605	And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say	486.4836730957031
1668/3605	Feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained	464.7914123535156
1669/3605	At length Felton who had not yet looked at Milady turned toward	262.47894287109375
1670/3605	Ah ah said he she is asleep thats	455.6650695800781
1671/3605	And he made some steps toward the	78.91712188720703
1672/3605	But my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached Milady this woman is not	662.1505737304688
1673/3605	What not asleep said Felton what is she doing then   She has f	314.21673583984375
1674/3605	Her face is very pale and I have listened in vain I do not hear her	173.98497009277344
1675/3605	You are right said Felton after having looked at Milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward	301.15826416015625
1676/3605	Go and tell Lord de Winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not having been foreseen I dont know what to	107.47727966308594
1677/3605	The soldier went out to obey the orders of his	189.33102416992188
1678/3605	Felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a	121.83970642089844
1679/3605	Milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the l	707.716552734375
1680/3605	She perceived Felton who sat with his back toward	885.6708984375
1681/3605	She continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round	218.37905883789062
1682/3605	She then thought that Lord de Winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jail	203.20806884765625
1683/3605	Her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her	3423.837890625
1684/3605	As a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed	134.7033233642578
1685/3605	Ah you are awake madame he said then I have nothing more to do	48.31916809082031
1686/3605	If you want anything you can	327.56689453125
1687/3605	Oh my God my God how I have suffered said Milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to	425.8719482421875
1688/3605	And she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she recl	673.57958984375
1689/3605	You will be served thus madame three times a day said	124.86937713623047
1690/3605	In the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at	25.376941680908203
1691/3605	If that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied	205.6771697998047
1692/3605	But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked Mil	821.8750610351562
1693/3605	A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her	286.9640808105469
1694/3605	I thank you sir replied the prisoner hum	122.69831848144531
1695/3605	Felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the	141.51327514648438
1696/3605	At the moment he was about to go out Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of Mil	47.0584831237793
1697/3605	He held a vial of salts in his	453.4783935546875
1698/3605	Well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go	262.93780517578125
1699/3605	These words of Feltons passed like ice through her	3099.983642578125
1700/3605	In that case my brave lieutenant let us leave Milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy She has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the	258.71783447265625
1701/3605	And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton and led him out	251.11376953125
1702/3605	On my honor they are not	185.02430725097656
1703/3605	I have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir I have full and perfect confidence in	86.2961196899414
1704/3605	Adieu dear sister till your next swoon   This was all that Milady could	568.6773681640625
1705/3605	Her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized	437.5068359375
1706/3605	She cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was	248.31024169921875
1707/3605	The blade was round and of flexible	6307.1201171875
1708/3605	A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door	260.5067443847656
1709/3605	Ha ha cried Lord de Winter ha ha Dont you see my brave Felton dont you see what I told you That knife was for you my lad she would have killed	378.63677978515625
1710/3605	Observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother	428.55419921875
1711/3605	If I had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of	105.29887390136719
1712/3605	Then no more of Felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody el	885.5640869140625
1713/3605	See John see how well she knows how to handle a	784.1964111328125
1714/3605	In fact Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her	1113.361572265625
1715/3605	You were right my Lord said Felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady you were right my Lord and I was	194.67849731445312
1716/3605	But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the	224.0614013671875
1717/3605	I am lost murmured she I am lost I am in the power of men upon whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my	175.709716796875
1718/3605	It is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed   In fact as this last reflection indicatedthis instinctive return to hopesentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent	718.703857421875
1719/3605	Milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little Spanish wine and felt all her resolution	671.0933837890625
1720/3605	One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner If I had listened to you Lord de Winter had said to Fel	193.75120544433594
1721/3605	Felton then had spoken in her favor since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to	106.9150161743164
1722/3605	Weak or strong repeated Milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour	710.079345703125
1723/3605	As to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his	136.5634765625
1724/3605	It is useless then to attempt anything with	206.5059051513672
1725/3605	He is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of	1047.12890625
1726/3605	And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her	59.03607940673828
1727/3605	Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next	193.83750915527344
1728/3605	She slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first	2306.321533203125
1729/3605	In the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in	85.84037017822266
1730/3605	He brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching Miladys bed offered her	246.86073303222656
1731/3605	Milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first	594.435302734375
1732/3605	I am in a fever said she I have not slept a single instant during all this long	168.5319366455078
1733/3605	Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday All I ask is permission to remain ab	863.9378051757812
1734/3605	Would you like to have a physician called said the	160.54705810546875
1735/3605	Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a	350.153564453125
1736/3605	Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and Lord de Winter would redouble his	251.1917266845703
1737/3605	Besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and Milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the	404.17822265625
1738/3605	Go and fetch a physician said	350.66766357421875
1739/3605	What could be the good of that These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy it would be just the same today no doubtfor since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a	251.5606689453125
1740/3605	Then said Felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish	1760.42724609375
1741/3605	Eh how can I tell My God I know that I suffer thats	175.5138397216797
1742/3605	Give me anything you like it is of little	421.5842590332031
1743/3605	Go and fetch Lord de Winter said Felton tired of these eternal	1375.510498046875
1744/3605	Oh no no cried Milady no sir do not call him I conjure	184.67066955566406
1745/3605	I am well I want nothing do not call	71.95878601074219
1746/3605	She gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the	295.55267333984375
1747/3605	Meanwhile madame if you really suffer said Felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive uswell it will be the worse for	179.9880828857422
1748/3605	But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with	66.56936645507812
1749/3605	Milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking so	773.5224609375
1750/3605	Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went	393.2064208984375
1751/3605	The woman followed him and Lord de Winter did not	92.01439666748047
1752/3605	I fancy I begin to see my way murmured Milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward	466.5282287597656
1753/3605	Now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very	197.23448181152344
1754/3605	I have but ten days and this evening two of them will be	124.31370544433594
1755/3605	In the morning when they entered Miladys chamber they had brought her	841.0603637695312
1756/3605	Now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that Felton would then reapp	590.4940185546875
1757/3605	Felton reappeared and without observing whether Milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready	203.1636962890625
1758/3605	Felton remained behind he held a book in his	178.1221160888672
1759/3605	Milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyr	559.5333251953125
1760/3605	Bartholomew they sometimes came to seek	2698.315673828125
1761/3605	She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their	827.7261352539062
1762/3605	I will tell it cried Milady with a feigned exultation on the day when I shall have suffered sufficiently for my	251.01702880859375
1763/3605	The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single	421.58367919921875
1764/3605	The young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had	306.3642883300781
1765/3605	I am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Pur	92.87316131591797
1766/3605	Well let my God save me or let me perish for my God That is the reply I beg you to make to Lord de	116.3385009765625
1767/3605	Felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensive	121.58619689941406
1768/3605	Lord de Winter came toward five oclock in the	60.472320556640625
1769/3605	Milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of	290.9333801269531
1770/3605	She received him like a woman who had already recovered all her	229.94923400878906
1771/3605	You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband have you   Explain yourself my Lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though I hear your words I declare I do not understand	258.5712890625
1772/3605	Then you have no religion at all I like that best replied Lord de Winter	215.34555053710938
1773/3605	Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied Milady frigid	1234.91357421875
1774/3605	Oh I confess it is all the same to	60.26201248168945
1775/3605	Oh you need not avow this religious indifference my Lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for	2378.3603515625
1776/3605	My jailers and my hangmen Heyday madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this	428.5652160644531
1777/3605	As to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be	97.13583374023438
1778/3605	Infamous task impious task cried Milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his	2698.740234375
1779/3605	My word said de Winter rising I think the hussy is going mad Come come calm yourself Madame Puritan or Ill remove you to a	1566.408447265625
1780/3605	Its my Spanish wine that has got into your head is it not But never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad	251.56521606445312
1781/3605	And Lord de Winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly	838.1026611328125
1782/3605	Felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this	120.93852996826172
1783/3605	Yes go go said she to her brother the effects _are_ drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun	225.84994506835938
1784/3605	Miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloudprayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere Pur	670.9577026367188
1785/3605	She appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around	86.56524658203125
1786/3605	Felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the	104.40322875976562
1787/3605	Milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to	128.1226806640625
1788/3605	For the moment she wished nothing	372.4996643066406
1789/3605	She arose came to the table ate but little and drank only	643.9642944335938
1790/3605	An hour after her table was cleared but Milady remarked that this time Felton did not accompany the	649.7429809570312
1791/3605	He feared then to see her too	265.65716552734375
1792/3605	She turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed	159.4152069091797
1793/3605	These verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their	421.7616271972656
1794/3605	The soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into	177.01943969726562
1795/3605	Milady was then able to judge of the effect she had	221.66018676757812
1796/3605	Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and	417.14581298828125
1797/3605	It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jail	432.3538513183594
1798/3605	Silence then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized as that of Fel	2089.560546875
1799/3605	What are you meddling with stupid Did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing	906.9238891601562
1800/3605	You were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to	618.6846313476562
1801/3605	Guard her If she flies kill her but dont exceed your	3154.99365234375
1802/3605	An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of	284.34490966796875
1803/3605	Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three Hebrews in the	1921.34912109375
1804/3605	Milady continued   One day our doors will ope     With God come our desire And if betrays that hope     To death we can	364.7580871582031
1805/3605	This verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young	959.1961059570312
1806/3605	He opened the door quickly and Milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost	290.4018249511719
1807/3605	Why do you sing thus and with such a voice said	142.86997985839844
1808/3605	Your pardon sir said Milady with mild	1627.05419921875
1809/3605	I forgot that my songs are out of place in this	276.4007873535156
1810/3605	I have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so I	124.94304656982422
1811/3605	Pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was	671.5335083007812
1812/3605	Milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before	166.3275909423828
1813/3605	Yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the	300.56732177734375
1814/3605	The poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while Milady was reading with her lynxs eyes the very depths of his	1095.0029296875
1815/3605	I will be silent then said Milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her	298.87689208984375
1816/3605	No no madame said Felton only do not sing so loud particularly at	798.8576049804688
1817/3605	And at these words Felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the	356.4540710449219
1818/3605	You have done right Lieutenant said the	993.2821655273438
1819/3605	Such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so	366.9554748535156
1820/3605	CAPTIVITY THE THIRD DAY     Felton had fallen but there was still another step to be	5424.65771484375
1821/3605	He must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and Milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this	323.5425720214844
1822/3605	He must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor Milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language	505.8835144042969
1823/3605	Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might failfor Felton was forewarned and that against the least	726.504638671875
1824/3605	From that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestureseven to a breath that could be interpreted as a	247.7228240966797
1825/3605	In short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not	451.5213928222656
1826/3605	Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more	231.5402374267578
1827/3605	She had laid that down the preceding	312.814453125
1828/3605	To remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignationsuch was her	401.3819885253906
1829/3605	Felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would	168.5963897705078
1830/3605	In the morning Felton came as usual but Milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to	411.0006408691406
1831/3605	It was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale English sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her	580.12939453125
1832/3605	Milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it	100.89053344726562
1833/3605	Ah ah said Lord de Winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy   The prisoner made no	313.8926696777344
1834/3605	Yes yes continued Lord de Winter I	75.26070404052734
1835/3605	Patience patience In four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to youmore open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days England will be relieved of	349.8316345214844
1836/3605	Milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven Lord Lord said she with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone pardon this man as I myself pardon	872.4801635742188
1837/3605	Yes pray accursed woman cried the baron your prayer is so much the more generous from your being I swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you and he went	87.68392944335938
1838/3605	At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived Felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by	218.43914794921875
1839/3605	Then she threw herself upon her knees and began to	80.38043212890625
1840/3605	My God my God said she thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer give me then strength to	593.2349853515625
1841/3605	I do not like to disturb those who pray madame said Felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account I beseech	110.5598373413086
1842/3605	How do you know I was praying sir said Milady in a voice broken by so	178.552490234375
1843/3605	You were deceived sir I was not	641.4396362304688
1844/3605	Guilty Oh my God thou knowest whether I am guilty Say I am condemned sir if you please but you know that God who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be	452.9111633300781
1845/3605	Were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied Felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and I myself would aid you with my	704.7984008789062
1846/3605	Oh you are a just man cried Milady throwing herself at his	120.85931396484375
1847/3605	I can hold out no longer for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my	101.29618072509766
1848/3605	Listen then to the supplication of a despairing	268.7180480957031
1849/3605	You are abused sir but that is not the	131.45993041992188
1850/3605	I only ask you one favor and if you grant it me I will bless you in this world and in the	72.03510284423828
1851/3605	Speak to the master madame said Felton happily I am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor	1256.427734375
1852/3605	It is upon one higher placed than I am that God has laid this	1082.0831298828125
1853/3605	What do you say Oh you do not understand me When I speak of ignominy you think I speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or	221.83547973632812
1854/3605	Would to heaven Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death   It is I who no longer understand you madame said Fel	334.3562927246094
1855/3605	Or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredul	109.76627349853516
1856/3605	No madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a	52.30189895629883
1857/3605	What you are ignorant of Lord de Winters designs upon me   I	57.642398834228516
1858/3605	Impossible you are his confidant   I never lie mad	334.9928894042969
1859/3605	Oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine	480.5350036621094
1860/3605	I seek to divine nothing madame I wait till I am confided in and apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to	136.8598175048828
1861/3605	Good said Milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime Then aloud The friend of that wretch is capable of	288.34478759765625
1862/3605	Whom do you call _that wretch_ asked Fel	1096.7607421875
1863/3605	Are there then in England two men to whom such an epithet can be applied   You mean George Villiers asked Felton whose looks became	1879.4256591796875
1864/3605	Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham replied Mil	19768.83203125
1865/3605	I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all England who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom I was	65.5492172241211
1866/3605	The hand of the Lord is stretched over him said Felton he will not escape the chastisement he	920.3462524414062
1867/3605	Felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the Catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the Puritans styled simply	1384.569091796875
1868/3605	At length he interrogates me said Milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great	534.9083862304688
1869/3605	Oh know him Yes yes to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and Milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of	145.4057159423828
1870/3605	Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped	235.8348846435547
1871/3605	He still doubts thought Milady I have not been earnest	520.3721313476562
1872/3605	Someone was heard in the corridor Milady recognized the step of Lord de	89.81672668457031
1873/3605	Felton recognized it also and made a step toward the	421.6409606933594
1874/3605	Felton gently repulsed Milady and she sank into a	363.2672424316406
1875/3605	Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die	122.87250518798828
1876/3605	Felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the	235.93960571289062
1877/3605	Ah said Milady listening in her turn to the noise of Feltons steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter at length you are mine   Then her brow	219.6729736328125
1878/3605	If he tells the baron said she I am lostfor the baron who knows very well that I shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but	108.44463348388672
1879/3605	She placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more	375.7063293457031
1880/3605	Oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell him   In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the	124.30683135986328
1881/3605	Sir said Milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me   How dear sister said Lord de	766.6780395507812
1882/3605	Besides this time my visit has a	220.8569793701172
1883/3605	Milady trembled she thought Felton had told	1010.734619140625
1884/3605	Perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so	249.52102661132812
1885/3605	Lord de Winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside	202.95912170410156
1886/3605	Then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it	294.62890625
1887/3605	Here said he I want to show you the kind of passport which I have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life I consent to leave	92.28550720214844
1888/3605	Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper he read Order to conduct The name is blank interrupted Lord de	565.1234741210938
1889/3605	If you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London attention will be paid to your	128.4488525390625
1890/3605	I will begin again then   Order to conduct tothe person named Charlotte Backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of France but liberated after chastis	2034.9556884765625
1891/3605	She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from	295.0581359863281
1892/3605	In case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be	132.87965393066406
1893/3605	She will receive five shillings per day for lodging and	4269.451171875
1894/3605	That order does not concern me replied Milady coldly since it bears another name than	524.3411865234375
1895/3605	A name Have you a name then   I bear that of your	88.71502685546875
1896/3605	My brother is only your second husband and your first is still	376.9340515136719
1897/3605	Tell me his name and I will put it in the place of the name of Charlotte Back	227.20350646972656
1898/3605	No You will not You are silent Well then you must be registered as Charlotte Back	2846.15380859375
1899/3605	Milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from	257.10223388671875
1900/3605	She believed the order ready for	1430.448486328125
1901/3605	She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure she thought she was condemned to set off that very	103.01310729980469
1902/3605	Everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the	89.94556427001953
1903/3605	The joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal	165.0709228515625
1904/3605	Yes yes said Lord de Winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself All is not lost for that order is not	149.13128662109375
1905/3605	It is only shown to me to terrify me thats	177.56996154785156
1906/3605	Tomorrow this order will be sent to the Duke of	51.14638137817383
1907/3605	The day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal and fourandtwenty hours afterward I will answer for its being carried into	148.8317108154297
1908/3605	That is all I had to say to	61.1840705871582
1909/3605	And I reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous   Would you like better to be hanged in your true name Milady You know that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of	347.720458984375
1910/3605	Although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of	140.73495483398438
1911/3605	Milady made no reply but became as pale as a	169.04736328125
1912/3605	Thats well madame and there is an old proverb that says Traveling trains	2668.35107421875
1913/3605	My faith you are not wrong after all and life is	347.9603271484375
1914/3605	Thats the reason why I take such care you shall not deprive me of	189.3865509033203
1915/3605	There only remains then the question of the five shillings to be	458.1883239746094
1916/3605	You think me rather parsimonious dont you Thats because I dont care to leave you the means of corrupting your jail	1758.5723876953125
1917/3605	Besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them	1235.5980224609375
1918/3605	Employ them if your check with regard to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that	2140.484619140625
1919/3605	Felton has not told him said Milady to	743.7403564453125
1920/3605	And now madame till I see you again Tomorrow I will come and announce to you the departure of my	138.25958251953125
1921/3605	Lord de Winter rose saluted her ironically and went	497.2581481933594
1922/3605	She had still four days before	210.69024658203125
1923/3605	Four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Fel	8472.859375
1924/3605	A terrible idea however rushed into her	340.16217041015625
1925/3605	She thought that Lord de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the Duke of	317.9036560058594
1926/3605	In that case Felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was	3084.398681640625
1927/3605	Nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured	235.70962524414062
1928/3605	As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter she placed herself at the table and	55.240997314453125
1929/3605	Then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers	84.51211547851562
1930/3605	As on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to	150.99658203125
1931/3605	Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her	188.4286651611328
1932/3605	And she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited Felton the evening	1404.2607421875
1933/3605	But although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained	3449.27001953125
1934/3605	It appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow	110.23556518554688
1935/3605	But whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to	381.1636047363281
1936/3605	However a few instants after she had finished her religious song Milady thought she heard a profound	600.6681518554688
1937/3605	Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with	710.9927978515625
1938/3605	At the noise Felton made in entering Milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her	428.7998962402344
1939/3605	The young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish	137.2349853515625
1940/3605	Nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than	1542.4794921875
1941/3605	He advanced slowly toward Milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen What is this madame he asked cold	280.0904846191406
1942/3605	That Nothing said Milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her	271.3221130371094
1943/3605	Ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners I had ennui and I amused myself with twisting that	3325.308837890625
1944/3605	He started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped	419.6560363769531
1945/3605	What were you doing on that armchair asked	112.11075592041016
1946/3605	But replied Felton I wish to	419.4461669921875
1947/3605	Do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true Christians are forbidden to	260.21820068359375
1948/3605	Well then said Felton I will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your	144.17466735839844
1949/3605	Remember madame if our God forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns	6841.654296875
1950/3605	When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied Milady in a tone of deep conviction God pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyr	1087.854248046875
1951/3605	You say either too much or too little speak mad	342.97119140625
1952/3605	In the name of heaven explain	567.6705932617188
1953/3605	That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor No	159.21746826171875
1954/3605	You suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life Oh you cannot believe what you say   Let me act as I please Felton let me act as I please said Milady el	219.82081604003906
1955/3605	Every soldier must be ambitious must he not You are a lieutenant Well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of	283.0116882324219
1956/3605	But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling Cruel enough if I am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the Lord give it if I am innocent   I am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders I have	235.07400512695312
1957/3605	Do you believe then that at the day of the Last Judgment God will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges You are not willing that I should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my	548.4894409179688
1958/3605	But I repeat it again to you replied Felton in great emotion no danger threatens you I will answer for Lord de Winter as for	262.72198486328125
1959/3605	Impossible madame impossible murmured Felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this	556.7123413085938
1960/3605	A prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through	179.063720703125
1961/3605	Yes cried Milady but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life I shall lose my honor Felton and it is you you whom I make responsible before God and before men for my shame and my inf	295.37713623046875
1962/3605	This time Felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of	189.45420837402344
1963/3605	She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young	918.82421875
1964/3605	Felton stood before this strange apparition like one pet	363.06427001953125
1965/3605	Who art thou Who art thou cried he clasping his	320.8298034667969
1966/3605	Yes yes said Felton I doubted but now I	795.5989990234375
1967/3605	Yes yes said Felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last	389.10882568359375
1968/3605	A flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of Mil	335.1192932128906
1969/3605	However fugitive this homicide flash Felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this womans	1737.306396484375
1970/3605	He recalled all at once the warnings of Lord de Winter the seductions of Milady her first attempts after her	595.9588623046875
1971/3605	He drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her	130.74447631835938
1972/3605	Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this	572.5341796875
1973/3605	Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned	4104.15283203125
1974/3605	The sword of the eternal is too heavy for my	419.448974609375
1975/3605	Allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyr	267.3668518066406
1976/3605	I do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a	718.8107299804688
1977/3605	I supplicate you I implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my pres	335.9269104003906
1978/3605	Hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast Felton reproached	1436.7882080078125
1979/3605	Alas said Felton I can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim But Lord de Winter makes cruel accusations against	324.39794921875
1980/3605	You are a Christian you are my sister in	267.0559387207031
1981/3605	I feel myself drawn toward youI who have never loved anyone but my benefactorI who have met with nothing but traitors and impious	263.2081604003906
1982/3605	But you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you	294.1450500488281
1983/3605	They have eyes repeated Milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear	187.88890075683594
1984/3605	Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fasc	249.94686889648438
1985/3605	Felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his	370.47991943359375
1986/3605	He paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he	88.33360290527344
1987/3605	During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly and when Lord de Winter entered he was several paces from the	240.5304718017578
1988/3605	The baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young	273.67437744140625
1989/3605	You have been here a very long time John said	182.89590454101562
1990/3605	Has this woman been relating her crimes to you In that case I can comprehend the length of the	211.43276977539062
1991/3605	Felton started and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Pur	191.96778869628906
1992/3605	Ah you fear your prisoner should escape said	370.3575134277344
1993/3605	Well ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of	750.1624755859375
1994/3605	You demanded a favor said the baron suspicious	237.20936584472656
1995/3605	Yes my Lord replied the young man	174.8726043701172
1996/3605	And what favor pray asked Lord de	422.6627502441406
1997/3605	A knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied Fel	178.9985809326172
1998/3605	There is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de Winter in an ironical contemptuous	339.98345947265625
1999/3605	I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn replied Lord de	555.3855590820312
2000/3605	Believe me the cord is more certain than the	278.0116882324219
2001/3605	Felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her	314.6455383300781
2002/3605	You are right said she I have often thought of	41.17821502685547
2003/3605	Then she added in a low voice And I will think of it	48.89329528808594
2004/3605	Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably Lord de Winter perceived this	1032.3203125
2005/3605	I have placed reliance upon you my	230.28028869628906
2006/3605	Beware I have warned you But be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where I shall send her she can harm	317.8942565917969
2007/3605	You hear him cried Milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that Felton might understand she was addressing	320.5114440917969
2008/3605	The baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone	73.26123809814453
2009/3605	Well said the prisoner when the door was shut I am not so far advanced as I	74.43150329589844
2010/3605	De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prud	357.3105773925781
2011/3605	It is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man As to Felton he hes	1888.228759765625
2012/3605	Ah he is not a man like that cursed DArtagn	34.04150390625
2013/3605	A Puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his	520.3272094726562
2014/3605	A Musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round	412.513427734375
2015/3605	Milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing Felton	710.1227416992188
2016/3605	At last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the	65.18894958496094
2017/3605	Presently the door opened and she perceived Fel	654.6126098632812
2018/3605	The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to Milady to be silent his face was much	155.63595581054688
2019/3605	What do you want with me said	39.00489807128906
2020/3605	Listen replied Felton in a low	420.2351379394531
2021/3605	I have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being	96.03387451171875
2022/3605	The baron has just related a frightful story to	126.72865295410156
2023/3605	Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her	687.59228515625
2024/3605	Either you are a demon continued Felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a	592.53076171875
2025/3605	I have known you four days I have loved him four	82.89339447021484
2026/3605	Be not alarmed at what I say I want to be	104.31196594238281
2027/3605	Tonight after twelve I will come and see you and you shall convince	104.2262954711914
2028/3605	No Felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and I feel what it must cost	263.4517517089844
2029/3605	No I am lost do not be lost with	79.44010925292969
2030/3605	My death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the	79.2081298828125
2031/3605	Be silent madame cried Felton and do not speak to me thus I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your	107.7185287475586
2032/3605	I will not promise said Milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have and if I make a promise I must keep	135.31689453125
2033/3605	Well said Felton only promise till you have seen me	623.9873046875
2034/3605	If when you have seen me again you still persistwell then you shall be free and I myself will give you the weapon you	135.35220336914062
2035/3605	Well said Milady for you I will	213.72474670410156
2036/3605	Are you satisfied   Well said Felton till	720.7039184570312
2037/3605	And he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldiers halfpike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his	91.91168975830078
2038/3605	The soldier returned and Felton gave him back his	1253.8966064453125
2039/3605	Then through the grating to which she had drawn near Milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of	198.91397094726562
2040/3605	As for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of God by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know	370.3681335449219
2041/3605	My God said she what a senseless fanatic My God it is IIand this fellow who will help me to avenge	595.5877685546875
2042/3605	CAPTIVITY THE FIFTH DAY     Milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her	17556.80859375
2043/3605	It was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her	455.03778076171875
2044/3605	Milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the	458.7884521484375
2045/3605	But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of	1064.7860107421875
2046/3605	Religion and its observances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary sed	21106.521484375
2047/3605	There fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material lovethat sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with	3233.180419921875
2048/3605	Milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and	348.2430114746094
2049/3605	In short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her	760.8096313476562
2050/3605	Many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of	556.995361328125
2051/3605	Milady being well prepared for the reception of Felton was able to erect her batteries for the next	877.3081665039062
2052/3605	To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of	459.2984313964844
2053/3605	Like all persons of real genius Milady knew what suited her nature and her	1039.73583984375
2054/3605	Poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her	955.17822265625
2055/3605	Milady was only a queen while among	1438.2989501953125
2056/3605	The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her	6914.93798828125
2057/3605	To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for	1682.0992431640625
2058/3605	She should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last For an active ambitious nature like that of Milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious	671.2290649414062
2059/3605	For the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her	275.9953918457031
2060/3605	Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the	213.2365264892578

2071/3605	Listen said the young man to the sent	21.824424743652344
2072/3605	On no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although I during his absence watched in his	289.53472900390625
2073/3605	Yes I know it said the	81.9213638305664

2076/3605	Good murmured Milady the austere Puritan	1952.3616943359375

2079/3605	Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare	734.4757080078125
2080/3605	I promised to come said Felton and I have	361.4797058105469

2082/3605	You promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our	128.0382080078125

2084/3605	There is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of God to inflict death upon	668.9055786132812
2085/3605	I have reflected and I cannot must not be guilty of such a	96.80992889404297
2086/3605	Ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and I also have	66.48942565917969

2088/3605	Here is the knife said Felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his	162.0446014404297
2089/3605	For what purpose   Upon my honor I will instantly return it to	121.17652130126953
2090/3605	You shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and	125.9515151977539
2091/3605	Felton offered the weapon to Milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her	253.68798828125
2092/3605	Well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good	422.3674011230469
2093/3605	Felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the	194.04225158691406
2094/3605	Milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of	56.02496337890625
2095/3605	The young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour	771.0956420898438
2096/3605	Felton said Milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to	355.224609375
2097/3605	While yet young unfortunately handsome I was dragged into a sn	765.3561401367188
2098/3605	Ambushes and violences multiplied around me but I	20613.283203125
2099/3605	The religion I serve the God I adore were blasphemed because I called upon that religion and that God but still I	1431.61865234375
2100/3605	Then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body	971.6057739257812
2101/3605	Finally   Milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her	70.33027648925781
2102/3605	Finally said Felton finally what did they do   At length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not	314.6683654785156
2103/3605	One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my	1528.336181640625
2104/3605	Scarcely had I finished my repast when I felt myself sink by degrees into a strange tor	326.08544921875
2105/3605	Although I was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and I tried to struggle against sleep	928.3828125
2106/3605	I wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their	172.7129364013672
2107/3605	It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its	283.0108947753906
2108/3605	I could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over	295.5311279296875
2109/3605	I supported myself by a chair feeling that I was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak	314.377685546875
2110/3605	I fell upon one knee then upon	502.4711608886719
2111/3605	I tried to pray but my tongue was	798.2445678710938
2112/3605	God doubtless neither heard nor saw me and I sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled	267.0527648925781
2113/3605	Of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted I have no	260.476806640625
2114/3605	The only thing I recollect is that I awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the	344.6121826171875
2115/3605	No door gave entrance to the	284.6029052734375
2116/3605	It might be called a magnificent	191.4677276611328
2117/3605	It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in or to take account of the details I	107.3673095703125
2118/3605	My mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which I could not rouse	231.7460174560547
2119/3605	At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I believed myself	414.9793701171875
2120/3605	My clothes were near me on a chair I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to	490.85552978515625
2121/3605	Then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste ter	1408.707275390625
2122/3605	I was no longer in the house where I had dw	40.76626968383789
2123/3605	As well as I could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds	91.25885772705078
2124/3605	The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish	205.42967224121094
2125/3605	Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend Felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my	320.1138610839844
2126/3605	Yes it was a prison for I tried in vain to get out of	72.87022399902344
2127/3605	I sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat	447.6461181640625
2128/3605	I made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was	93.34213256835938
2129/3605	I sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an arm	233.5951385498047
2130/3605	Meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors	10005.9638671875
2131/3605	I did not know but I had better remain where I was	93.49545288085938
2132/3605	It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every	204.7822265625
2133/3605	Although I had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling	373.8746643066406
2134/3605	No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me I only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of October and it was quite	131.85513305664062
2135/3605	All at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me	104.98717498779297
2136/3605	A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and I perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of	229.01922607421875
2137/3605	A table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the	295.1308898925781
2138/3605	That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding	190.02392578125
2139/3605	Oh yes scoundrel cried Milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange rec	208.3523406982422
2140/3605	Oh yes scoundrel He believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was	904.6666870117188
2141/3605	He came hoping that I would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my	183.48501586914062
2142/3605	All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words I poured out upon this	133.4507598876953
2143/3605	Doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his	187.1487274169922
2144/3605	Then when he thought I had said all he advanced toward me I sprang toward the table I seized a knife I placed it to my	145.11805725097656
2145/3605	Take one step more said I and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself	101.06974792480469
2146/3605	There was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he	757.9664306640625
2147/3605	Your death said he oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after I have had the happiness to possess you only a single	160.0703582763672
2148/3605	Adieu my charmer I will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better	434.6421203613281
2149/3605	At these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and	334.5495910644531
2150/3605	I found myself again in complete	816.6006469726562
2151/3605	The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and I was completely	1056.019287109375
2152/3605	This moment was frightful if I had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming	362.6299743652344
2153/3605	I was in the power of a man whom I not only detested but despisedof a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to	80.61422729492188
2154/3605	But who then was this man asked Fel	1208.9954833984375
2155/3605	I passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and I was again in	222.0055389404297
2156/3605	But the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecut	198.84048461914062
2157/3605	Day came the table had disappeared only I had still the knife in my	190.35511779785156
2158/3605	Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes I had not dared to sleep a single	896.8291015625
2159/3605	The light of day reassured me I went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which I concealed under my	981.6370849609375
2160/3605	When I awoke a fresh meal was	947.5086669921875
2161/3605	This time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony I began to feel a devouring	649.0335083007812
2162/3605	It was fortyeight hours since I had taken any nour	271.27593994140625
2163/3605	I ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk I would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing	442.2499084472656
2164/3605	And yet notwithstanding these precautions I remained for some time in a terrible agitation of	270.1563720703125
2165/3605	But my fears were this time illfounded I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I	1230.0926513671875
2166/3605	I took the precaution to half empty the _carafe_ in order that my suspicions might not be	129.0082244873047
2167/3605	The evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to	573.7081909179688
2168/3605	I saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my	288.7396545410156
2169/3605	In an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more light	193.9836883544922
2170/3605	I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into	816.0809936523438
2171/3605	Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank	831.6983032226562
2172/3605	At the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the	91.26903533935547
2173/3605	I paused but I had already drunk half a	203.0732421875
2174/3605	I threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my	560.9839477539062
2175/3605	No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly	498.7591857910156
2176/3605	I dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense I had leftmy saving knife but I could not reach the	681.7723999023438
2177/3605	I sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then I felt that I was	191.38694763183594
2178/3605	Felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole	450.9092712402344
2179/3605	It is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less fright	49.74714660644531
2180/3605	I saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then I heard the wellknown creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but	199.81097412109375
2181/3605	I felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the	400.59881591796875
2182/3605	I wished to make an effort I attempted to cry	173.84532165527344
2183/3605	By an incredible effort of will I even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecut	433.62530517578125
2184/3605	Tell me who this man was cried the young	225.2681884765625
2185/3605	Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single p	471.23675537109375
2186/3605	The more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge	676.0286254882812
2187/3605	She continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to	78.73058319091797
2188/3605	Only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal	178.1802215576172
2189/3605	I have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties I retained the sense of my	171.551025390625
2190/3605	I felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my sw	768.3143310546875
2191/3605	Felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of	592.9202270507812
2192/3605	The sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his	488.0760498046875
2193/3605	My first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife I had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for exp	209.3692626953125
2194/3605	But on taking this knife Felton a terrible idea occurred to	888.6054077148438
2195/3605	I have sworn to tell you all and I will tell you	19.664920806884766
2196/3605	I have promised you the truth I will tell it were it to destroy	89.16210174560547
2197/3605	The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried Fel	369.68157958984375
2198/3605	The idea was not that of a Christian I knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my	819.8889770507812
2199/3605	In short what shall I say to you Felton continued Milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a	490.9730529785156
2200/3605	This idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the	476.1038818359375
2201/3605	Continue continue said Felton I am eager to see you attain your vengeance   Oh I resolved that it should take place as soon as	173.0487823486328
2202/3605	I had no doubt he would return the following	102.83171081542969
2203/3605	During the day I had nothing to	51.526695251464844
2204/3605	When the hour of breakfast came therefore I did not hesitate to eat and	185.81356811523438
2205/3605	I had determined to make believe sup but to eat	740.5186767578125
2206/3605	I was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the	197.17298889160156
2207/3605	Only I concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained fortyeight hours without eating or	277.63134765625
2208/3605	The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution I had formed only I took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for I had no doubt I was	197.38710021972656
2209/3605	Several times even I felt a smile on my	248.57858276367188
2210/3605	Felton I dare not tell you at what idea I smiled you would hold me in horror   Go on go on said Felton you see plainly that I listen and that I am anxious to know the	172.48841857910156
2211/3605	Evening came the ordinary events took	1261.8385009765625
2212/3605	During the darkness as before my supper was	308.1549377441406
2213/3605	Then the lamp was lighted and I sat down to	65.80216217041016
2214/3605	I pretended to pour out water from the jug but I only drank that which I had saved in my	162.69183349609375
2215/3605	The substitution was made so carefully that my spies if I had any could have no suspicion of	285.3811950683594
2216/3605	After supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as I yielded to fatigue or as if I had become familiarized with danger I dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay	441.5901184082031
2217/3605	I found my knife where I had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convuls	160.91677856445312
2218/3605	Two hours passed away without anything fresh	2857.2294921875

2220/3605	At length I saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but I made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and	200.15982055664062

2225/3605	I looked upon myself as another Judith I gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when I saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair I struck him in the middle of his	153.95616149902344

2236/3605	I could not see the expression of his countenance but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was	84.19824981689453
2237/3605	Then you shall not leave this place said	46.47572326660156

2239/3605	I will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens   You shall have no weapon left in your	227.49806213378906
2240/3605	There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use	317.1809387207031

2248/3605	I heard the door open and shut and I remained overwhelmed less I confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged	321.64532470703125
2249/3605	All the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him	208.4615478515625

2262/3605	Oh I declare to you Felton I thought him mad   Yes yes I replied	189.84568786621094
2263/3605	Begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes   Very well it is your own	121.18513488769531

2269/3605	When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I thanked God for I thought I was about to	137.12803649902344
2270/3605	In the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door	244.80105590820312
2271/3605	He entered the apartment followed by a man in a	55.360740661621094
2272/3605	He was masked likewise but I knew his step I knew his voice I knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of	579.10205078125
2273/3605	Well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath I requested of you   You have said Puritans have but one	112.37213897705078

2275/3605	You persist then   I swear it before the God who hears	213.54502868652344
2276/3605	I will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until I have found an aven	109.46692657470703
2277/3605	Oh his name his name cried Fel	2049.28955078125
2278/3605	A burning fire a redhot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my	649.9855346679688
2279/3605	Here said Milady rising with the majesty of a queen here Felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a	587.2506103515625
2280/3605	Learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust	345.3924560546875
2281/3605	Milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful	918.072265625
2282/3605	But cried Felton that is a _fleurdelis_ which I see	1777.0015869140625
2283/3605	And therein consisted the infamy replied Mil	1906.1470947265625
2284/3605	The brand disappeared the beauty alone	2061.389404296875
2285/3605	Pardon Pardon cried Felton oh pardon   Milady read in his eyes _love love_   Pardon for what asked	457.5444641113281
2286/3605	Pardon me for having joined with your persecut	412.7086181640625
2287/3605	Milady held out her hand to	71.89156341552734
2288/3605	So beautiful so young cried Felton covering that hand with his	2947.55126953125
2289/3605	Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a	262.7351379394531
2290/3605	Felton was a Puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her	391.433349609375
2291/3605	He no longer loved her he adored	203.05638122558594
2292/3605	For to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was	91.6159439086914
2293/3605	Milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to	128.27667236328125
2294/3605	Buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried Fel	2964.36376953125

2296/3605	But he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said Felton with increasing exult	1271.8316650390625
2297/3605	He wills that human vengeance should precede celestial	4115.3896484375
2298/3605	I said Felton I do not fear him nor will I spare	477.2203369140625
2299/3605	The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal	170.32887268066406
2300/3605	But how can Lord de Winter my protector my father asked Felton possibly be mixed up with all this   Listen Felton resumed Milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous n	450.3319091796875
2301/3605	I had an affianced husband a man whom I loved and who loved mea heart like yours Felton a man like	255.10704040527344
2302/3605	I went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an	96.33930206298828
2303/3605	He was a nobleman a man equal to Buckingham in every	134.4366455078125
2304/3605	He said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to Buckingham	125.48745727539062
2305/3605	Yes yes said Felton I understand how he would	495.2283630371094
2306/3605	But with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poni	66.06423950195312
2307/3605	Buckingham had left England the day before sent as ambassador to Spain to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles	1039.3358154296875
2308/3605	who was then only Prince of	334.8737487792969
2309/3605	Hear me said he this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance but let us be united as we were to have been and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his	97.5838851928711
2310/3605	Yes said Milady Lord de Winter and now you can understand it all can you not Buckingham remained nearly a year	404.32855224609375
2311/3605	A week before his return Lord de Winter died leaving me his sole	535.3862915039062
2312/3605	Whence came the blow God who knows all knows without doubt but as for me I accuse	933.3038330078125
2313/3605	Oh what an abyss what an abyss cried Fel	18985.03125
2314/3605	Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his	816.765380859375
2315/3605	The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the	193.21112060546875
2316/3605	Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless	750.3660278320312
2317/3605	I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an	388.4505310058594
2318/3605	I went to France with a determination to remain there for the rest of my	75.45391845703125
2319/3605	But all my fortune is in	85.50228881835938
2320/3605	Communication being closed by the war I was in want of	508.53375244140625
2321/3605	I was then obliged to come back	66.4703140258789
2322/3605	Six days ago I landed at	1698.8914794921875
2323/3605	Well Buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my	203.26864624023438
2324/3605	He spoke of me to Lord de Winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded	958.0249633789062
2325/3605	The noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend	123.53536224365234
2326/3605	Lord de Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe	157.18621826171875
2327/3605	He caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your	415.90667724609375
2328/3605	The day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the	838.1705932617188
2329/3605	Oh the train is well laid the plot is	1421.6981201171875
2330/3605	My honor will not survive it You see then Felton I can do nothing but	816.043212890625
2331/3605	No you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your	706.1090087890625
2332/3605	Milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but Felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a div	783.7799682617188
2333/3605	Oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame Felton my brother my friend I conjure you   No cried Felton no you shall live and you shall be aven	343.5578308105469
2334/3605	Felton I bring misfortune to all who surround me Felton abandon me Felton let me die   Well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the	403.0340576171875
2335/3605	Several strokes resounded on the door this time Milady really pushed him away from	383.6076354980469
2336/3605	Hark said she we have been overheard Someone is coming All is over We are lost   No said Felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the	342.3072204589844
2337/3605	Then run to the door and open it	136.8105010986328
2338/3605	Felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole	492.3602294921875
2339/3605	He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watchpat	1624.5472412109375
2340/3605	Well what is the matter asked the young	47.29152297973633
2341/3605	You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the	110.05068969726562
2342/3605	I heard you cry out without understanding what you	242.80809020996094
2343/3605	I tried to open the door but it was locked inside then I called the	190.81568908691406
2344/3605	And here I am said the	71.41295623779297
2345/3605	Felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speech	2127.862548828125
2346/3605	Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the	283.7362365722656
2347/3605	She ran to the table and seizing the knife which Felton had laid down exclaimed And by what right will you prevent me from dying   Great God exclaimed Felton on seeing the knife glitter in her	309.1750793457031
2348/3605	At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	132.8897247314453
2349/3605	The baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the	157.9980926513672
2350/3605	Ah said he here we are at the last act of the	64.16295623779297
2351/3605	You see Felton the drama has gone through all the phases I named but be easy no blood will	3413.2490234375
2352/3605	Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate and terrible proof of her	1600.3365478515625
2353/3605	You are mistaken my Lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow   Felton uttered a cry and rushed toward	448.73089599609375
2354/3605	He was too late Milady had stabbed	296.5217590332031
2355/3605	But the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of	508.47991943359375
2356/3605	It had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the	1349.2381591796875
2357/3605	Miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a	670.6513061523438
2358/3605	Milady fell down and seemed to be in a sw	144.01600646972656
2359/3605	See my Lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself   Be at ease Felton said Lord de	206.78623962402344
2360/3605	She is not dead demons do not die so	482.71539306640625
2361/3605	Be tranquil and go wait for me in my	328.3475646972656
2362/3605	But my Lord   Go sir I command you   At this injunction from his superior Felton obeyed but in going out he put the knife into his bos	165.98492431640625
2363/3605	As to Lord de Winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on Milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them	108.97570037841797
2364/3605	Meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a	433.4289245605469
2365/3605	ESCAPE     As Lord de Winter had thought Miladys wound was not	554.761962890625
2366/3605	So soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her	58.4485969543457
2367/3605	It was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Mil	917.842041015625
2368/3605	Thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all	791.3832397460938
2369/3605	But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from	145.8138427734375
2370/3605	There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced Felton was	1500.3399658203125
2371/3605	If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the	171.78506469726562
2372/3605	Milady smiled at this thought for Felton was now her only hopeher only means of	864.8339233398438
2373/3605	But Lord de Winter might suspect him Felton himself might now be watched   Toward four oclock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time Milady stabbed herself however short the wound had	364.302490234375
2374/3605	The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by Miladys pulse that the case was not	635.8142700195312
2375/3605	In the morning Milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended	237.575439453125
2376/3605	She had one hope which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast hour but Felton did not	682.8555297851562
2377/3605	Were her fears realized Was Felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment She had only one day	718.6318359375
2378/3605	Lord de Winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twenty	1484.83740234375
2379/3605	Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for	820.9553833007812
2380/3605	Although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual	115.24906921386719
2381/3605	Milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was	273.7843933105469
2382/3605	Then she ventured to ask what had become of Fel	451.1247253417969
2383/3605	She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horse	52.15247344970703
2384/3605	She inquired if the baron was still at the	140.1322784423828
2385/3605	The soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to	54.94034957885742
2386/3605	Milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left	118.9503402709961
2387/3605	The soldier went out leaving the dinner	1154.9195556640625
2388/3605	This was the last blow to the	76.13874053955078
2389/3605	The bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of	240.65965270996094
2390/3605	She cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the gr	148.47898864746094
2391/3605	He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her	663.478271484375
2392/3605	She was free now to give way to her transports without being	631.1515502929688
2393/3605	She traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron	516.6866455078125
2394/3605	_Certes_ if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the bar	338.9520263671875
2395/3605	At six oclock Lord de Winter came	63.595096588134766
2396/3605	This man in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jail	172.4490203857422
2397/3605	He appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate	677.2013549804688
2398/3605	A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	102.35699462890625
2399/3605	Ay said he I see but you shall not kill me	54.680789947509766
2400/3605	You have no longer a weapon and besides I am on my	107.54305267333984
2401/3605	You had begun to pervert my poor Fel	5253.7587890625
2402/3605	He was yielding to your infernal influence but I will save	180.80587768554688
2403/3605	He will never see you again all is	110.96493530273438
2404/3605	I had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will	423.2970886230469
2405/3605	Tomorrow by twelve oclock I shall have the order for your exile signed _Buckingham	653.5674438476562
2406/3605	If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains	451.0682067871094
2407/3605	If when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the	182.77297973632812
2408/3605	_Au revoir_ then that is all I have to say	192.49246215820312
2409/3605	Tomorrow I will see you again to take my	60.96198654174805
2410/3605	With these words the baron went	60.400848388671875
2411/3605	Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her	467.8680114746094
2412/3605	Milady felt that she stood in need of all her	193.9264373779297
2413/3605	She did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a	352.2853088378906
2414/3605	Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her	892.0884399414062
2415/3605	The thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her	373.0466003417969
2416/3605	It appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their	601.1128540039062
2417/3605	She howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with	305.6122741699219
2418/3605	All at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the	140.55857849121094
2419/3605	She ran to the window and opened	42.251304626464844
2420/3605	Yes said Felton but silence silence I must have time to file through these	1693.8140869140625
2421/3605	Only take care that I am not seen through the w	99.04585266113281
2422/3605	Oh it is a proof that the Lord is on our side Felton replied Mil	468.2456359863281
2423/3605	They have closed up the grating with a	176.63552856445312
2424/3605	That is well God has made them senseless said Fel	1934.9500732421875
2425/3605	But what must I do asked Mil	478.1402893066406
2426/3605	Go to bed or at least lie down in your	174.82781982421875
2427/3605	As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes of	64.53568267822266
2428/3605	But will you be able to follow me   Oh yes   Your wound   Gives me pain but will not prevent my	133.2970428466797
2429/3605	Be ready then at the first	205.22984313964844
2430/3605	Milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as Felton had desired her to lie down on the	414.29150390625
2431/3605	Amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the pan	354.9315185546875
2432/3605	She passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the	352.72015380859375
2433/3605	There are hours which last a	1176.134765625
2434/3605	At the expiration of an hour Felton tapped	1422.2283935546875
2435/3605	Milady sprang out of bed and opened the	149.29550170898438
2436/3605	Two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass	289.30401611328125
2437/3605	Must I take anything with me   Money if you have	81.09588623046875
2438/3605	Yes fortunately they have left me all I	130.99644470214844
2439/3605	So much the better for I have expended all mine in chartering a	504.59246826171875
2440/3605	Here said Milady placing a bag full of louis in Feltons	720.400146484375
2441/3605	Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the	90.76935577392578
2442/3605	Now said he will you come   I am	30.90560531616211
2443/3605	Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the	139.01087951660156
2444/3605	She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of	266.89031982421875
2445/3605	For the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a	142.2783203125
2446/3605	I will descend with my eyes	219.79954528808594
2447/3605	Have you confidence in me said Fel	1240.860595703125
2448/3605	You ask that   Put your two hands	299.191162109375
2449/3605	Cross them thats right   Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handker	217.32469177246094
2450/3605	What are you doing asked Milady with	218.80235290527344
2451/3605	Pass your arms around my neck and fear	232.65814208984375
2452/3605	But I shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to	156.00611877441406
2453/3605	Not a second was to be	98.8903579711914
2454/3605	Milady passed her two arms round Feltons neck and let herself slip out of the	809.9912109375
2455/3605	Felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by	610.28271484375
2456/3605	Despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the	237.93777465820312
2457/3605	We are discovered   There was a silence of several	182.83425903320312
2458/3605	But what then is the noise   That of the patrol going their	220.71600341796875
2459/3605	Where is their road   Just under	221.99728393554688
2460/3605	They will discover us   No if it does not light	97.39012908935547
2461/3605	But they will run against the bottom of the	95.0206527709961
2462/3605	Fortunately it is too short by six	148.35606384277344
2463/3605	Here they are My God   Silence   Both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and	212.77244567871094
2464/3605	This was a terrible moment for the fug	73.89010620117188
2465/3605	The noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died	328.4230041503906
2466/3605	Milady breathed a deep sigh and f	226.5327911376953
2467/3605	Near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the	152.92356872558594
2468/3605	He stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his	115.09815216064453
2469/3605	Then he took Milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had	206.25938415527344
2470/3605	He soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whist	179.30628967285156
2471/3605	A similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four	274.40966796875
2472/3605	The boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch	325.469970703125
2473/3605	Felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to	912.2770385742188
2474/3605	Fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was	687.1392822265625
2475/3605	The little boat bounded over the waves like a	2307.664794921875
2476/3605	To the sloop said Felton and row	2380.45361328125
2477/3605	The four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of	214.38134765625
2478/3605	However they left the castle behind that was the principal	267.1501770019531
2479/3605	It was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the	72.91937255859375
2480/3605	A black point floated on the	624.5028686523438
2481/3605	While the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it Felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Miladys hands	740.480224609375
2482/3605	When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her	692.4238891601562
2483/3605	Milady breathed a sigh and opened her	220.99212646484375
2484/3605	Yes there is the sky here is the sea The air I breathe is the air of liberty Ah thanks Felton thanks   The young man pressed her to his	365.012451171875
2485/3605	But what is the matter with my hands asked Milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a	199.93992614746094
2486/3605	Milady held out her arms her wrists were	3645.39697265625
2487/3605	Alas said Felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrow	377.0708923339844
2488/3605	Milady looked around her as if in search of	116.91313934326172
2489/3605	It is there said Felton touching the bag of money with his	377.2939147949219
2490/3605	A sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat	2525.924560546875
2491/3605	The one I have hired for	103.28278350830078
2492/3605	Where will it take me   Where you please after you have put me on shore at	223.51132202148438
2493/3605	What are you going to do at Portsmouth asked Mil	343.16619873046875
2494/3605	Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter said Felton with a gloomy	344.0097961425781
2495/3605	As he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your	334.7505187988281
2496/3605	But if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you   How could I know what I was the bearer of   Thats true And you are going to Portsmouth   I have no time to	50.12760925292969
2497/3605	Tomorrow is the twentythird and Buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his	28209.43359375
2498/3605	He sets sail tomorrow Where for   For La Roc	1202.9700927734375
2499/3605	He need not sail cried Milady forgetting her usual presence of	929.6417236328125
2500/3605	Be satisfied replied Felton he will not	1167.361083984375
2501/3605	She could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of Buckingham was written there at full	116.27777099609375
2502/3605	Felton cried she you are as great as Judas Maccabeus If you die I will die with you that is all I can say to	501.8310852050781
2503/3605	Felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to Milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much	402.51263427734375
2504/3605	An instant after they were on the	220.68948364257812
2505/3605	Captain said Felton this is the person of whom I spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to	121.53205871582031
2506/3605	For a thousand pistoles said the	51.281715393066406
2507/3605	I have paid you five hundred of	139.38143920898438
2508/3605	And here are the other five hundred replied Milady placing her hand upon the bag of	259.5939636230469
2509/3605	No said the captain I make but one bargain and I have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at Boulog	110.74916076660156
2510/3605	And shall we arrive there   Safe and sound as true as my names Jack	4376.4873046875
2511/3605	Well said Milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred I will give you a thousand pist	75.41503143310547
2512/3605	Hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship   Meanwhile said Felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in	906.3316650390625
2513/3605	The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been	206.99429321289062
2514/3605	On her side Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than	1086.1484375
2515/3605	It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten oclock if he did not return by ten oclock she was to	147.3656005859375
2516/3605	In that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in France at the convent of the Carmelites at Béth	145.1947479248047
2517/3605	WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23 1628     Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her	10600.4130859375
2518/3605	As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward Milady who standing on the deck followed him with her	78.03092956542969
2519/3605	Both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into Miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to	334.40814208984375
2520/3605	Felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted Milady a last time and took his course toward the	795.0343017578125
2521/3605	At the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sl	65.91879272460938
2522/3605	He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and	455.2422180175781
2523/3605	Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter bent with each breath of the	453.01678466796875
2524/3605	Felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James	1032.1328125
2525/3605	furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Pur	478.4256286621094
2526/3605	This was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an	740.0745849609375
2527/3605	He entered Portsmouth about eight oclock in the	162.56846618652344
2528/3605	The whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the port the troops about to embark were marching toward the	434.5478210449219
2529/3605	Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty covered with dust and streaming with pers	405.1041564941406
2530/3605	His countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and	688.1754150390625
2531/3605	The sentinel wanted to repulse him but Felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said A pressing message from Lord de	209.02880859375
2532/3605	At the name of Lord de Winter who was known to be one of his Graces most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let Felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval	275.46673583984375
2533/3605	At the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his forekne	643.4722290039062
2534/3605	Felton and he addressed Patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same	425.9151916503906
2535/3605	Felton named Lord de Winter the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself	234.0772705078125
2536/3605	Each was anxious to gain admission before the	226.26258850097656
2537/3605	Patrick who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his	110.46430206298828
2538/3605	The other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the	218.53396606445312
2539/3605	Lieutenant Felton from Lord de Winter said	3249.517333984375
2540/3605	From Lord de Winter repeated Buckingham let him come	241.6240234375
2541/3605	At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pear	275.6756591796875
2542/3605	Why didnt the baron come himself demanded	1783.7471923828125
2543/3605	He desired me to tell your Grace replied Felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the	352.2994384765625
2544/3605	Yes I know that said Buckingham he has a	238.56680297851562
2545/3605	It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace replied Fel	675.0087890625
2546/3605	Well then speak   That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my Lord   Leave us Patrick said Buckingham but remain within sound of the	327.6265563964844
2547/3605	We are alone sir said Buckingham speak   My Lord said Felton the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Back	673.7854614257812
2548/3605	Yes sir and I answered him to bring or send me that order and I would sign	187.2657470703125
2549/3605	Give it to me said the d	21.643260955810547
2550/3605	And taking it from Felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign	92.50627899169922
2551/3605	Pardon my Lord said Felton stopping the duke but does your Grace know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this young woman   Yes sir I know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the	327.66046142578125
2552/3605	Then your Grace knows her real name asked Felton in a sharp	3674.11767578125
2553/3605	I know it and the duke put the quill to the	83.91500091552734
2554/3605	And knowing that real name my Lord replied Felton will you sign it all the same   Doubtless said Buckingham and rather twice than	430.8874816894531
2555/3605	I cannot believe continued Felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this	1195.05615234375
2556/3605	I know it perfectly although I am astonished that you know	69.92963409423828
2557/3605	And will your Grace sign that order without remorse   Buckingham looked at the young man haught	748.097412109375
2558/3605	Do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that I am very foolish to answer them   Reply to them my Lord said Felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps	300.6073303222656
2559/3605	Buckingham reflected that the young man coming from Lord de Winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and	638.068115234375
2560/3605	The baron knows as well as myself that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to	932.3995361328125
2561/3605	The duke put his pen to the	93.4867172241211
2562/3605	You will not sign that order my Lord said Felton making a step toward the d	426.6908874511719
2563/3605	I will not sign this order And why not   Because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the	102.37383270263672
2564/3605	I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn said	1167.9852294921875
2565/3605	My Lord Milady de Winter is an angel you know that she is and I demand her liberty of	197.68295288085938
2566/3605	Bah Are you mad to talk to me thus said	295.02734375
2567/3605	My Lord excuse me I speak as I can I restrain	220.69622802734375
2568/3605	But my Lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too far   What do you say God pardon me cried Buckingham I really think he threatens me   No my Lord I still	169.67242431640625
2569/3605	And I say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many	1411.7884521484375
2570/3605	Felton said Buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under	1318.3074951171875
2571/3605	You will hear me to the end my	179.33621215820312
2572/3605	You have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled	1440.8455810546875
2573/3605	Repair your crimes toward her let her go free and I will exact nothing else from	464.4947509765625
2574/3605	You will exact said Buckingham looking at Felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced	558.8427734375
2575/3605	My Lord continued Felton becoming more excited as he spoke my Lord beware All England is tired of your iniquities my Lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped my Lord you are held in horror by God and	1297.5819091796875
2576/3605	God will punish you hereafter but I will punish you here   Ah this is too much cried Buckingham making a step toward the	167.29258728027344
2577/3605	I ask it humbly of you my Lord said he sign the order for the liberation of Milady de	364.21685791015625
2578/3605	Remember that she is a woman whom you have dishon	59.496612548828125
2579/3605	Withdraw sir said Buckingham or I will call my attendant and have you placed in ir	695.792236328125
2580/3605	You shall not call said Felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with	450.4051513671875
2581/3605	Beware my Lord you are in the hands of God   In the hands of the devil you mean cried Buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely	176.25482177734375
2582/3605	Sign my Lord sign the liberation of Milady de Winter said Felton holding out a paper to the d	598.0263061523438
2583/3605	By force You are joking Holloa Patrick   Sign my Lord  	1431.95458984375
2584/3605	Never   Help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his	50.132259368896484
2585/3605	But Felton did not give him time to draw	217.62998962402344
2586/3605	He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the d	117.70745086669922
2587/3605	At that moment Patrick entered the room crying A letter from France my	1468.7657470703125
2588/3605	From France cried Buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter	1931.3145751953125
2589/3605	Felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the	229.66258239746094
2590/3605	Ah traitor cried Buckingham you have killed me   Murder screamed	1440.5537109375
2591/3605	Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes	101.29289245605469
2592/3605	At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick the man whom Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the	165.69969177246094
2593/3605	He found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the	100.11943054199219
2594/3605	Laporte said the duke in a dying voice Laporte do you come from her   Yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of Austria but too late	79.60930633544922
2595/3605	Oh I cannot tell what she says to me My God I am dying   And the duke swoon	98.7947769165039
2596/3605	Meanwhile Lord de Winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of Buckinghams household had all made their way into the	197.76177978515625
2597/3605	Cries of despair resounded on all	169.51739501953125
2598/3605	The news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the	544.5852661132812
2599/3605	The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken	395.71124267578125
2600/3605	He recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all	1451.4822998046875
2601/3605	Gentlemen said he leave me alone with Patrick and Laporteah is that you De Winter You sent me a strange madman this morning See the state in which he has put	637.5057983398438
2602/3605	Oh my Lord cried the baron I shall never console	166.52392578125
2603/3605	And you would be quite wrong my dear De Winter said Buckingham holding out his hand to	132.8173828125
2604/3605	I do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us I pray	127.5923843383789
2605/3605	There only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and	284.7109680175781
2606/3605	A physician was sought for but none was yet	1721.926513671875
2607/3605	You will live my Lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of Anne of Austria on his knees before the dukes	141.1884765625
2608/3605	What has she written to me said Buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me Read me her	600.623779296875
2609/3605	Obey Laporte do you not see I have no time to lose   Laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the	74.5819320678711
2610/3605	Read said he read I cannot	98.18697357177734
2611/3605	Read then For soon perhaps I shall not hear and I shall die without knowing what she has written to	110.66780853271484
2612/3605	This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France but misfortune upon you my Lord for which I should never console	327.23046875
2613/3605	Be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear     to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in	90.37026977539062
2614/3605	And is that allis that all replied Buckingham impatient	832.0775146484375
2615/3605	She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved	125.37076568603516
2616/3605	Ah said Buckingham God be praised My death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger   Laporte burst into	162.58575439453125
2617/3605	Patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were	111.48883819580078
2618/3605	Patrick brought the object desired which Laporte recognized as having belonged to the	191.8673095703125
2619/3605	Now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pear	419.4247741699219
2620/3605	Here Laporte said Buckingham these are the only tokens I ever received from herthis silver casket and these two	515.1124877929688
2621/3605	And you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of Laport	85.11177825927734
2622/3605	Buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of	715.6973876953125
2623/3605	At this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admirals ship where they had been obliged to seek	180.29241943359375
2624/3605	He approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall All is useless said he he is	127.39620971679688
2625/3605	At this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and	232.85203552246094
2626/3605	As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead he ran to Felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the	295.6235656738281
2627/3605	Wretch said he to the young man who since the death of Buckingham had regained that coolness and selfpossession which never after abandoned him wretch what have you done   I have avenged myself said	116.97052001953125
2628/3605	Rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but I swear to you that this crime shall be her	100.25816345214844
2629/3605	I dont know what you mean replied Felton quietly and I am ignorant of whom you are speaking my	190.72000122070312
2630/3605	I killed the Duke of Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain I have punished him for his injustice that is	300.1624450683594
2631/3605	De Winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound Felton and could not tell what to think of such insens	370.6488342285156
2632/3605	One thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of Fel	1002.0396728515625
2633/3605	At every noise he heard the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with	169.37994384765625
2634/3605	His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he	93.3036880493164
2635/3605	With the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of	244.39389038085938
2636/3605	He grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treacher	239.9599609375
2637/3605	One last favor my Lord said he to the bar	170.72006225585938
2638/3605	What oclock is it   The baron drew out his	37.02671813964844
2639/3605	It wants ten minutes to nine said	465.8457946777344
2640/3605	Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a	176.15769958496094
2641/3605	As soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be	255.72647094726562
2642/3605	The vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the	240.6998291015625
2643/3605	God has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his	183.53558349609375
2644/3605	De Winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed	363.6835632324219
2645/3605	Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syll	629.2904663085938
2646/3605	As to Lord de Winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the	65.6759262084961
2647/3605	IN FRANCE     The first fear of the King of England Charles	247.43087768554688
2648/3605	He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England the ambassadors of Denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of Holland who was to take back to the port of Flushing the Indian merchantmen of which Charles	411.0972595214844
2649/3605	had made restitution to the United Provin	27321.89453125
2650/3605	As to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set	429.6798095703125
2651/3605	During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of	310.8333435058594
2652/3605	Germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musket	149.17921447753906
2653/3605	The cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of	367.8170471191406
2654/3605	The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after	98.4597396850586
2655/3605	de Tréville for they were the first to whom he communicated	89.86801147460938
2656/3605	It was then that DArtagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left	143.07936096191406
2657/3605	It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had for a cause the danger which M	397.6365966796875
2658/3605	Bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of Béthune with Milady her mortal	949.2804565429688
2659/3605	Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for M	1013.69287109375
2660/3605	Bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into Lorraine or	872.7901000976562
2661/3605	They had not long to wait for an	64.63077545166016
2662/3605	Eight or ten days afterward Aramis received the following letter   MY DEAR COUSIN Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of Béthune the air of which you think is bad for	1537.958984375
2663/3605	My sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable	1516.40771484375
2664/3605	There was no further question therefore about Marie Michon among the four Musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw M	470.90435791015625
2665/3605	Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of Béth	380.5770263671875
2666/3605	It was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at La Rochelle that is to say at the other end of	91.14122009277344
2667/3605	Therefore DArtagnan was going to ask leave of absence of	38.476505279541016
2668/3605	The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the six	102.53822326660156
2669/3605	The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgères to Mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of	1667.8856201171875
2670/3605	Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heart	1147.30419921875
2671/3605	DArtagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which Porthos explained thus A very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you	284.2139587402344
2672/3605	At length the escort passed through Paris on the twentythird in the	910.15576171875
2673/3605	de Tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the Bast	702.8917846679688
2674/3605	The first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four	2415.53515625
2675/3605	de Tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nightsfor they set out on the twentyfourth at five oclock in the evening and as a further kindness	246.6932830810547
2676/3605	de Tréville postdated the leave to the morning of the twenty	2727.081787109375
2677/3605	Good Lord said DArtagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at	173.40420532226562
2678/3605	It appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple	65.99736785888672
2679/3605	In two days and by using up two or three horses thats nothing I have plenty of money I am at Béth	424.00048828125
2680/3605	I present my letter from the queen to the superior and I bring back the dear treasure I go to seeknot into Lorraine not into Belgium but to Paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at La Roc	375.6724548339844
2681/3605	Well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we	250.89988708496094
2682/3605	Remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless	871.2753295898438
2683/3605	Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition	259.8618469238281
2684/3605	To this Athos replied quietly We also have money leftfor I have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and Porthos and Aramis have not eaten all	178.4848175048828
2685/3605	We can therefore use up four horses as well as	283.1042785644531
2686/3605	But consider DArtagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that Béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with	299.1466369628906
2687/3605	If you had only to deal with four men DArtagnan I would allow you to go	50.82290267944336

2689/3605	My God what do you fear   Everything replied Ath	35.15077209472656
2690/3605	DArtagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of Athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another	76.39472961425781
2691/3605	DArtagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass	58.771217346191406

2709/3605	Accordingly that same evening Milady commenced her	1077.1739501953125
2710/3605	Night overtook her she stopped and slept at an	217.95816040039062
2711/3605	At five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered Béth	478.57940673828125
2712/3605	She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites and went thither	209.93821716308594
2713/3605	The superior met her Milady showed her the cardinals	415.1315612792969
2714/3605	The abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast	1969.0250244140625
2715/3605	The evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and	1124.07568359375
2716/3605	After breakfast the abbess came to pay her a	266.079345703125
2717/3605	There is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new board	405.7815856933594
2718/3605	This was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she	193.6359405517578
2719/3605	She tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole	748.793701171875
2720/3605	Milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six	204.38909912109375
2721/3605	But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a	221.1754608154297
2722/3605	Milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the	798.7913208007812
2723/3605	She did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle	362.0242614746094
2724/3605	But the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his Emin	405.088134765625
2725/3605	Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act	344.4891357421875
2726/3605	Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with M	525.6775512695312
2727/3605	dAiguillon Marion de Lorme and several other gay	22369.7265625
2728/3605	The abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and	1558.8194580078125
2729/3605	Good thought Milady she takes a pleasure in my	613.4196166992188
2730/3605	If she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at	655.400634765625
2731/3605	She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his	179.762939453125
2732/3605	The abbess only crossed herself without approving or disappro	5981.93212890625
2733/3605	This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinal	458.18963623046875
2734/3605	Milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and	10130.865234375
2735/3605	I am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have	169.1941375732422
2736/3605	And one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal   One of your boarders said Milady oh my God Poor woman I pity her	524.1115112304688
2737/3605	And you have reason for she is much to be pit	115.24769592285156
2738/3605	Imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered	15550.896484375
2739/3605	But after all resumed the abbess Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the	419.9679260253906
2740/3605	Good said Milady to herself who knows I am about perhaps to discover something here I am in the	235.882568359375
2741/3605	She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect cand	106.39561462402344
2742/3605	Alas said Milady I know it is	212.54156494140625
2743/3605	You would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent   The cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain	333.681640625
2744/3605	Permit me madame to express my surprise said the abb	144.1552734375
2745/3605	At what said Milady with the utmost ingenuous	1118.8798828125
2746/3605	What do you find so astonishing in that language said Milady	291.47296142578125
2747/3605	You are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet   And yet I speak ill of him replied Milady finishing the thought of the	150.36050415039062
2748/3605	At least you dont speak well of	339.9090881347656
2749/3605	Ah said Milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether	167.15933227539062
2750/3605	Then said the abbess looking at Milady with increasing interest I behold another poor victim   Alas yes said Mil	388.4974060058594
2751/3605	The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her	156.66444396972656
2752/3605	You are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitating	128.8455047607422
2753/3605	You will find here moreover the young woman of whom I spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court	258.82037353515625
2754/3605	What is her name   She was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of	101.87609100341797
2755/3605	I have not tried to discover her other	145.0458984375
2756/3605	What Are you sure   That she is called so Yes mad	84.01072692871094
2757/3605	Do you know her   Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chamber	110.04114532470703
2758/3605	There was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of Milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to	222.8751983642578
2759/3605	And when can I see this young lady for whom I already feel so great a sympathy asked Mil	362.52783203125
2760/3605	Why this evening said the abbess today	309.2446594238281
2761/3605	But you have been traveling these four days as you told me	107.71529388427734
2762/3605	This morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of rep	94.0645751953125
2763/3605	Go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse	338.3679504394531
2764/3605	Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the	509.2068786621094
2765/3605	During the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required rep	570.8328247070312
2766/3605	She therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought to her	257.940185546875
2767/3605	She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her	309.77581787109375
2768/3605	All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady so rocked by them she soon fell	992.5185546875
2769/3605	She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her	69.8958969116211
2770/3605	She opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent	187.04933166503906
2771/3605	The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to	70.07843780517578
2772/3605	Each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of	1059.6751708984375
2773/3605	Milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic	523.3907470703125
2774/3605	It is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this	200.140625
2775/3605	The abbess introduced them to each	483.6452331542969
2776/3605	When this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women	458.8938903808594
2777/3605	The novice seeing Milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but Milady stopped	376.4841003417969
2778/3605	Well said Milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening This awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bed	235.85928344726562
2779/3605	How unfortunate I am said she I have been here six months without the shadow of	144.6040802001953
2780/3605	You arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet I expect in all probability to quit the convent at any	338.4697570800781
2781/3605	How you are going soon asked Mil	409.24176025390625
2782/3605	At least I hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to	127.40137481689453
2783/3605	I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued Milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between	211.45263671875
2784/3605	What I have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked	248.82168579101562
2785/3605	Hush said Milady let us not even here speak thus of	300.2255554199219
2786/3605	All my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom I thought my friend and who betrayed	97.35061645507812
2787/3605	Are you also the victim of a treachery   No said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman I loved for whom I would have laid down my life for whom I would give it	128.3249969482422
2788/3605	But you madame you appear to be free continued the novice and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do	159.4800567626953
2789/3605	Hear me said the novice we must trust in	591.9817504882812
2790/3605	Oh when I said I was alone said Milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the	364.6205139160156
2791/3605	The queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible	325.5076599121094
2792/3605	I have proof that her Majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons who had served	263.3179931640625
2793/3605	Trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in	217.23880004882812
2794/3605	The more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind	636.2694702148438
2795/3605	Alas said Milady I believe so the queen is so good   Oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with	276.6073913574219
2796/3605	That is to say replied Milady driven into her entrenchment that I have not the honor of knowing her personally but I know a great number of her most intimate	250.79115295410156
2797/3605	I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange I met Monsieur Dujart in England I know Monsieur de Tré	128.1378936767578
2798/3605	Monsieur de Tréville exclaimed the novice do you know Monsieur de Tréville   Yes perfectly wellintimately	97.52010345458984
2799/3605	The captain of the kings Musketeers   The captain of the kings Musket	66.95329284667969
2800/3605	Why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost	561.3529663085938
2801/3605	If you know Monsieur de Tréville you must have visited him   Often said Milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the	101.65463256835938
2802/3605	With him then you must have seen some of his Musketeers   All those he is in the habit of receiving replied Milady for whom this conversation began to have a real	139.75946044921875
2803/3605	Name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my	58.65715789794922
2804/3605	Well said Milady embarrassed I know Monsieur de Louvigny Monsieur de Courtivron Monsieur de Feruss	395.86712646484375
2805/3605	What is the matter Good God asked the poor woman have I said anything that has wounded you   No but the name struck me because I also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him	117.47587585449219
2806/3605	Oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends Messieurs Porthos and Aramis   Indeed you know them likewise I know them cried Milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her	137.30006408691406
2807/3605	Well if you know them you know that they are good and free	106.22057342529297
2808/3605	Why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help   That is to say stammered Milady I am not really very intimate with any of	95.20193481445312
2809/3605	I know them from having heard one of their friends Monsieur dArtagnan say a great deal about	50.75779342651367
2810/3605	You know Monsieur dArtagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her	60.50078582763672
2811/3605	Then remarking the strange expression of Miladys countenance she said Pardon me madame you know him by what title   Why replied Milady embarrassed why by the title of	169.2436065673828
2812/3605	You deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress   It is you who have been his mistress madame cried Milady in her	139.4296417236328
2813/3605	You are Madame Bonacieux   The young woman drew back filled with surprise and	82.22631072998047
2814/3605	Oh do not deny it Answer continued Mil	616.3175048828125
2815/3605	Well yes madame said the novice Are we rivals   The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances M	649.1746826171875
2816/3605	Bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by	255.394287109375
2817/3605	Bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed	101.880126953125
2818/3605	Have you been or are you his mistress   Oh no cried Milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her	165.93150329589844
2819/3605	Never never   I believe you said M	243.92376708984375
2820/3605	Bonacieux but why then did you cry out so   Do you not understand said Milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of	141.6593780517578
2821/3605	How can I understand I know	93.81047058105469
2822/3605	Can you not understand that Monsieur dArtagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence   Truly   Do you not perceive that I know allyour abduction from the little house at	138.66436767578125
2823/3605	Bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted	316.09686279296875
2824/3605	Oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of Mil	187.22877502441406
2825/3605	Pardon me I love him so much   These two women held each other for an instant in a close	143.99403381347656
2826/3605	Certainly if Miladys strength had been equal to her hatred M	2817.673828125
2827/3605	Bonacieux would never have left that embrace	480.3173522949219
2828/3605	But not being able to stifle her she smiled upon	83.98705291748047
2829/3605	Oh you beautiful good little creature said Mil	2286.27734375
2830/3605	How delighted I am to have found you Let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her	232.08096313476562
2831/3605	Oh yes it is you indeed From what he has told me I know you	84.71631622314453
2832/3605	The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and	557.2307739257812
2833/3605	Then you know what I have suffered said M	233.49380493164062
2834/3605	Bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is	123.4363784790039
2835/3605	Milady replied mechanically Yes that is	4767.96630859375
2836/3605	Bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a	348.68365478515625
2837/3605	Tomorrow this evening perhaps I shall see him again and then the past will no longer	61.764259338378906
2838/3605	This evening asked Milady roused from her reverie by these	288.9473571777344
2839/3605	What do you mean Do you expect news from him   I expect	86.08934783935547
2840/3605	Himself DArtagnan here   Himself   But thats impossible He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the	97.77293395996094
2841/3605	He will not return till after the taking of the	120.75120544433594
2842/3605	Ah you fancy so But is there anything impossible for my DArtagnan the noble and loyal gentleman   Oh I cannot believe you   Well read then said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to Mil	127.79808044433594
2843/3605	The writing of Madame de Chevreuse said Milady to	105.20903015136719
2844/3605	Ah I always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter And she greedily read the following few lines   MY DEAR CHILD Hold yourself	3949.515869140625
2845/3605	_Our friend_ will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be	422.1151123046875
2846/3605	Prepare then for your departure and never despair of	275.0104064941406
2847/3605	Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful     as	254.7610626220703
2848/3605	Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning     he has	208.53103637695312
2849/3605	Yes yes said Milady the letter is	1034.920654296875
2850/3605	Do you know what that warning was   No I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the	320.9574279785156
2851/3605	Yes thats it no doubt said Milady returning the letter to M	748.9822387695312
2852/3605	Bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bos	154.32644653320312
2853/3605	At that moment they heard the gallop of a	95.1230239868164
2854/3605	Bonacieux darting to the window can it be he   Milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a	163.2435760498047
2855/3605	He he murmured she can it be he And she remained in bed with her eyes	92.85270690917969
2856/3605	Bonacieux it is a man I dont know although he seems to be coming	83.46007537841797
2857/3605	Yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he	6927.08935546875
2858/3605	You are sure it is not he said	55.676063537597656
2859/3605	Yes yes very sure   Perhaps you did not see	125.71971893310547
2860/3605	Oh if I were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak I should know _him_   Milady was dressing herself all the	147.26895141601562
2861/3605	It is for you or me   My God how agitated you seem   Yes I admit	68.11868286132812
2862/3605	I have not your confidence I fear the	80.92005920410156
2863/3605	Immediately the door opened and the superior	452.6632995605469
2864/3605	Did you come from Boulogne demanded she of Mil	69.92942810058594
2865/3605	Yes replied she trying to recover her selfp	246.3965606689453
2866/3605	Who wants me   A man who will not tell his name but who comes from the	79.70140838623047

2890/3605	The devil Whats to be done   What did the cardinal say about me   I was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to	173.80296325683594

2921/3605	And you say you will wait for me at Armentières   At Armentiè	128.73550415039062
2922/3605	Write that name on a bit of paper lest I should forget	223.04541015625

2924/3605	Is it not so   Eh who knows Never mind said Milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper I will compromise	276.4989929199219

2932/3605	What   To ask me if I want	40.20285415649414
2933/3605	How much do you want   All you have in	69.82121276855469

2936/3605	And you go   In an hourtime to eat a morsel during which I shall send for a post	255.17333984375
2937/3605	Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and	272.339111328125
2938/3605	An hour afterward Rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through Ar	247.7852020263672
2939/3605	Our readers already know how he was recognized by DArtagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given fresh activity to their	383.6954650878906
2940/3605	THE DROP OF WATER     Rochefort had scarcely departed when M	3869.123291015625
2941/3605	She found Milady with a smiling count	304.78173828125
2942/3605	Well said the young woman what you dreaded has	125.21453857421875
2943/3605	This evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you	282.53814697265625
2944/3605	Who told you that my dear asked Mil	180.8571014404297
2945/3605	I heard it from the mouth of the messenger	137.26490783691406
2946/3605	Come and sit down close to me said Mil	202.51161193847656
2947/3605	Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears	745.7986450195312
2948/3605	Why all these precautions   You shall	34.90275955200195
2949/3605	Milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to M	312.4827575683594
2950/3605	Then said she he has well played his	304.28656005859375
2951/3605	Who has   He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the	107.71415710449219
2952/3605	It was then a part he was playing   Yes my	73.25896453857422
2953/3605	That man then was not   That man said Milady lowering her voice is my	227.87794494628906
2954/3605	No one must know this secret my dear but	188.48924255371094
2955/3605	If you reveal it to anyone in the world I shall be lost and perhaps yourself	149.317138671875
2956/3605	This is what has happened My brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of	83.19322204589844
2957/3605	At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the	93.39136505126953
2958/3605	The messenger resisted my brother killed	4227.548828125
2959/3605	Then my brother determined to substitute cunning for	4863.5732421875
2960/3605	He took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his Emin	68.45964050292969
2961/3605	It is your brother who sends this	378.9759826660156
2962/3605	That letter you have received and which you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse   Well   It is a for	44.31141662597656
2963/3605	How can that be   Yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch	103.75993347167969
2964/3605	But it is DArtagnan that will	24.697099685668945
2965/3605	DArtagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of La Roc	33.939735412597656
2966/3605	How do you know that   My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of Musket	71.58799743652344
2967/3605	You would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to	187.55760192871094
2968/3605	Oh my God My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniqu	6025.31982421875
2969/3605	I feel if this continues said M	2815.236328125
2970/3605	Bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead I shall go mad   Stop   What   I hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off	163.40074157714844
2971/3605	I should like to offer him a last	276.3721923828125
2972/3605	Come   Milady opened the window and made a sign to M	101.82587432861328
2973/3605	The chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to Mil	139.440673828125
2974/3605	The good George said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and	199.15524291992188
2975/3605	And she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely	732.9796752929688
2976/3605	Bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do Good heaven You have more experience than I	208.4004364013672
2977/3605	In the first place said Milady it is possible I may be deceived and that DArtagnan and his friends may really come to your	63.51781463623047
2978/3605	Oh that would be too much cried M	704.8243408203125
2979/3605	Bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me   Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive	100.12129211425781
2980/3605	If your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are	314.9651184082031
2981/3605	Oh yes yes lost beyond redemption What then to do What to do   There would be a very simple means very natural   Tell me what   To wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for	129.72421264648438
2982/3605	But where can I wait   Oh there is no difficulty in	67.7014389038086
2983/3605	I shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin	472.6085510253906
2984/3605	Well I take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait	318.9227294921875
2985/3605	But I shall not be allowed to go I am almost a	57.284461975097656
2986/3605	As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow	95.19706726074219
2987/3605	But DArtagnan DArtagnan if he comes   Shall we not know it   How   Nothing	29.985177993774414
2988/3605	We will send my brothers servant back to Béthune whom as I told you we can	790.2764282226562
2989/3605	He shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the	213.92213439941406
2990/3605	If the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is Monsieur dArtagnan and his friends he will bring them to	36.849185943603516
2991/3605	He knows them then   Doubt	40.319923400878906
2992/3605	Has he not seen Monsieur dArtagnan at my house   Oh yes yes you are	15.137234687805176
2993/3605	Thus all may go wellall may be for the best but we do not go far from this place   Seven or eight leagues at the	177.44256591796875
2994/3605	We will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave	212.4712371826172
2995/3605	And what can we do there  	79.82524871826172
2996/3605	But if they come   My brothers carriage will be here	270.658203125
2997/3605	If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for youat dinner or supper for instance   Do one	174.65435791015625
2998/3605	What is that   Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my rep	118.71348571777344
2999/3605	Will she permit it   What inconvenience can it be   Oh delightful In this way we shall not be separated for an	155.46136474609375
3000/3605	Well go down to her then to make your	165.31346130371094
3001/3605	I feel my head a little confused I will take a turn in the	97.7494888305664
3002/3605	Go and where shall I find you   Here in an	68.3594970703125
3003/3605	Now then all is agreed let us go	141.04225158691406
3004/3605	You are going into the garden  	27.26228141784668
3005/3605	Go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in	208.48878479003906
3006/3605	Excellent thank you   And the two women parted exchanging charming	504.2679748535156
3007/3605	Milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed one another like	7488.16943359375
3008/3605	She required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into	209.80661010742188
3009/3605	She saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular	502.31182861328125
3010/3605	What was most pressing was to get M	2832.763427734375
3011/3605	Bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a	420.80963134765625
3012/3605	Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did	481.4104309082031
3013/3605	Besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near and could not fail to be	271.3260192871094
3014/3605	The principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep M	560.6780395507812
3015/3605	Bonacieux was the very life of DArtagn	30.4549503326416
3016/3605	This was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good	367.5063781738281
3017/3605	Once concealed with her at Armentières it would be easy to make her believe that DArtagnan had not come to Béth	167.8396759033203
3018/3605	In fifteen days at most Rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four	260.5560607910156
3019/3605	She would not be weary thank God for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her characterperfecting a beautiful	794.7488403320312
3020/3605	Revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her	135.74563598632812
3021/3605	Milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a	385.1755065917969
3022/3605	At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was M	288.09423828125
3023/3605	The good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup	383.80743408203125
3024/3605	On reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the	86.68937683105469
3025/3605	It is the one my brother sends for	357.3935241699219
3026/3605	Oh my God   Come come courage   The bell of the convent gate was sounded Milady was not	156.87921142578125
3027/3605	Go to your chamber said she to M	955.330810546875
3028/3605	Bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to	141.6122283935547
3029/3605	Well go and fetch them and come to my	139.3219757080078
3030/3605	We will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength	459.31378173828125
3031/3605	Bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so I cannot	162.1809539794922
3032/3605	Courage courage remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for _his_	95.72810363769531
3033/3605	You have restored my courage by a single word go I will rejoin	166.52415466308594
3034/3605	Milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found Rocheforts lackey and gave him his	509.9309387207031
3035/3605	He was to wait at the gate if by chance the Musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the	82.78654479980469
3036/3605	In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on	347.1548767089844
3037/3605	As we have already said Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of	105.01896667480469
3038/3605	If the Musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed M	508.4595947265625
3039/3605	Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away M	160.60157775878906
3040/3605	Bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any Milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her	183.3345947265625
3041/3605	Milady asked some questions about the	697.695556640625
3042/3605	It was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion Rocheforts lackey would precede it as	3731.350341796875
3043/3605	Milady was wrong in fearing that M	5507.24169921875
3044/3605	You see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is	254.8124542236328
3045/3605	The abbess suspects nothing and believes that I am taken by order of the	543.9216918945312
3046/3605	This man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be	384.9489440917969
3047/3605	Bonacieux mechanically yes let us be	259.595703125
3048/3605	Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of Spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a	248.25779724121094
3049/3605	See said she if everything does not second us Here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we	360.10992431640625
3050/3605	Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her	187.68707275390625
3051/3605	Come come said Milady lifting hers to her mouth do as I	542.0682983398438
3052/3605	But at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gall	183.65298461914062
3053/3605	Then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of	105.6468505859375
3054/3605	This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while M	487.97198486328125
3055/3605	Bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid	283.574462890625
3056/3605	Nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw	366.68243408203125
3057/3605	Bonacieux what is that noise   That of either our friends or our enemies said Milady with her terrible cool	174.06072998046875
3058/3605	Stay where you are I will tell	19.72287940979004
3059/3605	Bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a	126.32942199707031
3060/3605	The noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces	89.95624542236328
3061/3605	If they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an	143.3253173828125
3062/3605	The noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoof	339.7933349609375
3063/3605	Milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was	128.4513702392578
3064/3605	All at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horse	389.8229064941406
3065/3605	One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his	172.57554626464844
3066/3605	In the first horseman she recognized DArtagn	72.21031951904297
3067/3605	Oh my God my God cried M	1256.5631103515625
3068/3605	Bonacieux what is it   It is the uniform of the cardinals	77.58770751953125
3069/3605	Not an instant to be lost Fly fly   Yes yes let us fly repeated M	915.6943359375
3070/3605	Bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by	181.67372131347656
3071/3605	They heard the horsemen pass under the	181.4442138671875
3072/3605	Come then come then cried Milady trying to drag the young woman along by the	272.2577209472656
3073/3605	Thanks to the garden we yet can flee I have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late   M	228.59339904785156
3074/3605	Bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her	236.86769104003906
3075/3605	Milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do	242.8966827392578
3076/3605	At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the Musketeers set off at a gall	51.828582763671875
3077/3605	Then three or four shots were	32.08234405517578
3078/3605	For the last time will you come cried Mil	238.96678161621094
3079/3605	Oh my God my God you see my strength fails me you see plainly I cannot	257.638916015625
3080/3605	Flee alone   Flee alone and leave you here No no never cried Mil	501.96917724609375
3081/3605	All at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into M	573.458740234375
3082/3605	Bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quick	272.4470520019531
3083/3605	It was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved	677.9237670898438
3084/3605	Then taking the glass with a firm hand she said	364.1361083984375
3085/3605	This wine will give you strength drink And she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank	269.1853942871094
3086/3605	This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself said Milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith we do what we can And she rushed out of the	110.17718505859375
3087/3605	Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to	211.31565856933594
3088/3605	A few moments passed a great noise was heard at the	87.80941772460938
3089/3605	Bonacieux expected to see Milady but she did not	130.12014770507812
3090/3605	Several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning	460.3576965332031
3091/3605	At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the	104.6806411743164
3092/3605	There was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name	194.45758056640625
3093/3605	All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of DArtagn	32.63743209838867
3094/3605	Bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of	116.25553894042969
3095/3605	DArtagnan threw down a yetsmoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his	126.62753295898438
3096/3605	Athos replaced his in his belt Porthos and Aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabb	153.1779022216797
3097/3605	Oh DArtagnan my beloved DArtagnan You have come then at last You have not deceived me It is indeed thee   Yes yes Const	102.44023895263672

3099/3605	Oh I have done well How happy I am   At this word _she_ Athos who had seated himself quietly started	117.45789337158203
3100/3605	She who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecut	265.65008544921875
3101/3605	She who mistaking you for the cardinals Guards has just fled	913.6823120117188
3102/3605	Your companion cried DArtagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his	117.7115478515625
3103/3605	Of what companion are you speaking dear Constance   Of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend of a woman to whom you have told	212.65074157714844
3104/3605	My God can you not remember her name   Yes it was pronounced in my hearing	145.2013397216797
3105/3605	Stopbutit is very strangeoh my God my head swims I cannot see   Help help my friends her hands are icy cold cried DArtagn	261.5748596191406
3106/3605	Oh said Athos oh no it is impossible God would not permit such a crime   Water water cried DArtagn	130.3606719970703
3107/3605	Water   Oh poor woman poor woman murmured Athos in a broken	95.04299926757812
3108/3605	Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of DArtagn	51.44377517700195
3109/3605	Oh my God my God I thank thee   Madame said Athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this   Mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying	63.361331939697266
3110/3605	But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass  	143.45037841796875
3111/3605	But who is _she_   Oh I remember said M	414.9822998046875
3112/3605	The four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of Athos dominated all the	295.9688415527344
3113/3605	At that moment the countenance of M	281.77166748046875
3114/3605	Bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos and Aram	124.83834838867188
3115/3605	DArtagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be	68.6904067993164
3116/3605	And what do you believe His voice was stifled by so	210.684814453125
3117/3605	I believe everything said Athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sigh	197.40196228027344
3118/3605	Bonacieux where art thou Do not leave me You see I am dying   DArtagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to	67.52086639404297
3119/3605	Her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her	419.1624755859375
3120/3605	In the name of heaven run call Aramis Porthos Call for help   Useless said Athos useless For the poison which _she_ pours there is no	463.7088928222656
3121/3605	Bonacieux help   Then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to	111.40274047851562
3122/3605	A sigh escaped from the mouth of M	852.338623046875
3123/3605	Bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of DArtagn	27.342144012451172
3124/3605	That sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to	1294.2882080078125
3125/3605	DArtagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his	36.977561950683594
3126/3605	The young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as	92.05095672607422
3127/3605	Porthos wept Aramis pointed toward heaven Athos made the sign of the	106.13131713867188
3128/3605	At that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the	99.31282043457031
3129/3605	He looked around him and saw M	640.2955322265625
3130/3605	Bonacieux dead and DArtagnan in a sw	43.22174072265625
3131/3605	He appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrop	157.1877899169922
3132/3605	I was not deceived said he here is Monsieur dArtagnan and you are his friends Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aram	27.976287841796875
3133/3605	The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with aston	182.150634765625
3134/3605	It seemed to all three that they knew	161.5877227783203
3135/3605	Gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as I am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for I see a	136.59239196777344
3136/3605	The three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what	389.1897277832031
3137/3605	Gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice I must name	304.5999755859375
3138/3605	I am Lord de Winter brotherinlaw of that _woman	104.57063293457031
3139/3605	The three friends uttered a cry of	35.777488708496094
3140/3605	Athos rose and offering him his hand Be welcome my Lord said he you are one of	275.1180725097656
3141/3605	I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth said Lord de	478.9028625488281
3142/3605	I arrived three hours after her at Boulog	73.30036926269531
3143/3605	I missed her by twenty minutes at	751.1908569335938
3144/3605	Finally at Lilliers I lost all trace of	977.7433471679688
3145/3605	I was going about at random inquiring of everybody when I saw you gallop	279.1712646484375
3146/3605	I called to you but you did not answer me I wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with	53.730735778808594
3147/3605	And yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too	173.52389526367188
3148/3605	You see said Athos pointing to M	477.5633850097656
3149/3605	Bonacieux dead and to DArtagnan whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to	34.744998931884766
3150/3605	Are they both dead asked Lord de Winter stern	472.9744567871094
3151/3605	No replied Athos fortunately Monsieur dArtagnan has only f	30.710866928100586
3152/3605	Ah indeed so much the better said Lord de	39.02739334106445
3153/3605	At that moment DArtagnan opened his	17.413536071777344
3154/3605	He tore himself from the arms of Porthos and Aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his	34.630802154541016
3155/3605	Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis to go and fetch the	73.49293518066406
3156/3605	The two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five	624.64404296875
3157/3605	Madame said Athos passing his arm under that of DArtagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate	115.13871765136719
3158/3605	She was an angel on earth before being an angel in	357.37158203125
3159/3605	Treat her as one of your	625.9732666015625
3160/3605	We will return someday to pray over her	4239.27294921875
3161/3605	DArtagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos and sobbed	43.94124984741211
3162/3605	Weep said Athos weep heart full of love youth and life Alas would I could weep like you   And he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered	312.7455749511719
3163/3605	All five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of Béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came	453.9699401855469
3164/3605	But said DArtagnan shall we not pursue that woman   Later said Ath	84.96965026855469
3165/3605	She will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault Ath	57.92979049682617
3166/3605	I will be accountable for her said Ath	116.52354431152344
3167/3605	DArtagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without	53.84679412841797
3168/3605	Porthos and Aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of Ath	88.9935531616211
3169/3605	Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of DArtagn	97.2877426147461
3170/3605	Now gentlemen said Athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own	256.15997314453125
3171/3605	DArtagnan needs to be alone to weep and to	63.65016174316406
3172/3605	I take charge of everything be	524.0950317382812
3173/3605	It appears however said Lord de Winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sisterin	129.18817138671875
3174/3605	And me said Athos she is my wife   DArtagnan smiledfor he understood that Athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a	59.47695541381836
3175/3605	Porthos and Aramis looked at each other and grew	33.14787673950195
3176/3605	Lord de Winter thought Athos was	246.45249938964844
3177/3605	Now retire to your chambers said Athos and leave me to	302.8932189941406
3178/3605	You must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns	396.8276062011719
3179/3605	Only DArtagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that mans hat upon which is written the name of the village of   Ah said DArtagnan I comprehend that name written in her	51.726322174072266
3180/3605	THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK     The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary	3034.13623046875
3181/3605	Planchet Grimaud Bazin and Mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from Ath	230.0862274169922
3182/3605	They must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to Armentièreseach by a different	450.31646728515625
3183/3605	Planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by Rocheforts	141.19601440429688
3184/3605	Athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential	221.6680145263672
3185/3605	Then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address	1764.2384033203125
3186/3605	Besides Milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew Milady	179.3621368408203
3187/3605	All four were to meet the next day at eleven o	48.68218994140625
3188/3605	If they had discovered Miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to Béthune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide to the four	415.5595397949219
3189/3605	Athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hô	155.27369689941406
3190/3605	At ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequ	155.3831024169922
3191/3605	Athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a	289.9680480957031
3192/3605	At length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to	278.0572814941406
3193/3605	The man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the Musketeer by	202.5590362548828
3194/3605	Athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man	248.96017456054688
3195/3605	Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly	709.8799438476562
3196/3605	Nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood	389.8766174316406
3197/3605	In a few minutes a night watch	180.664794921875
3198/3605	Athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he	128.8094940185547
3199/3605	The night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany Athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to	134.6039276123047
3200/3605	Athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered	143.34335327148438
3201/3605	There he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third	227.34742736816406
3202/3605	Fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to Athos to ask charity Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was	168.80990600585938
3203/3605	The mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before Ath	88.64884948730469
3204/3605	Arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and	256.0604248046875
3205/3605	Athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry	144.02383422851562
3206/3605	Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was	177.33279418945312
3207/3605	No light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was	183.75967407226562
3208/3605	It was dark and silent as the	160.69580078125
3209/3605	Three times Athos knocked without receiving an	563.1087036132812
3210/3605	At the third knock however steps were heard	2382.349853515625
3211/3605	The door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and	157.7049102783203
3212/3605	Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come	75.49091339111328
3213/3605	Athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind	103.32874298095703
3214/3605	The man whom Athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a	219.4518585205078
3215/3605	All the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the	321.30072021484375
3216/3605	All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural	207.33203125
3217/3605	There was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this	796.7386474609375
3218/3605	Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near	174.61697387695312
3219/3605	Then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of	73.29188537597656
3220/3605	But scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the Musketeer drew back with signs of terror and	218.10983276367188
3221/3605	Then Athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repug	119.23052978515625
3222/3605	The tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to	123.97769927978516
3223/3605	He arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the hôtel and went to his	133.4597930908203
3224/3605	At daybreak DArtagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be	54.66752243041992
3225/3605	Some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the Musketeers that the burial would take place at	205.9482421875
3226/3605	As to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found	119.92827606201172
3227/3605	As to the key it had	134.91036987304688
3228/3605	At the hour appointed Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was	219.4540557861328
3229/3605	In the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was	746.3561401367188
3230/3605	At the door of the chapel DArtagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for Athos but Athos had	92.14826965332031
3231/3605	Then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the	144.97254943847656
3232/3605	Athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the	331.4009704589844
3233/3605	At the end of threequarters of a league within fifty paces of Festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by	640.1260986328125
3234/3605	Between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden the carriage had stopped	324.59136962890625
3235/3605	At this spot Milady had come out of the wood and entered the	97.48737335205078
3236/3605	Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions Athos returned to the hôtel and found Planchet impatiently waiting for	252.09130859375
3237/3605	Planchet had followed the road like Athos he had discovered the stains of blood like Athos he had noted the spot where the horses had	136.7864227294922
3238/3605	The accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the	423.0097351074219
3239/3605	The man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her	453.94244384765625
3240/3605	Planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found	188.45687866210938
3241/3605	He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles and from Fromelles she had set out for Armentiè	518.2578735351562
3242/3605	Planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at Armentiè	46.46943283081055
3243/3605	There was but one tavern the	3904.9658203125
3244/3605	Planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a	55.06587219238281
3245/3605	Planchet had no need to learn	70.09033203125
3246/3605	He hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find Athos who had just received this information when his friends	127.62598419189453
3247/3605	All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of Aram	310.08367919921875
3248/3605	What is to be done asked DArtagn	11.571159362792969
3249/3605	At eight oclock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the	153.83705139160156
3250/3605	In an instant all five were	624.6318359375
3251/3605	Each examined his arms and put them in	87.18401336669922
3252/3605	Athos came down last and found DArtagnan already on horseback and growing	185.83502197265625
3253/3605	Patience cried Athos one of our party is still	248.06610107421875
3254/3605	The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could	212.75531005859375
3255/3605	At this moment Planchet brought out Athoss horse the Musketeer leaped lightly into the	115.23528289794922
3256/3605	Wait for me cried he I will soon be back and he set off at a gall	50.21485900878906
3257/3605	In a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red	125.75323486328125
3258/3605	Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another inquiring	125.46663665771484
3259/3605	Neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of Ath	143.22528076171875
3260/3605	At nine oclock guided by Planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had	346.7806396484375
3261/3605	It was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastis	1443.28125
3262/3605	TRIAL     It was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till	583.6017456054688
3263/3605	Occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in	437.0931396484375
3264/3605	Every minute Athos was forced to restrain DArtagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed	79.1229248046875
3265/3605	He had but one thoughtto go forward and he	608.3236083984375
3266/3605	They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of Riche	1796.3843994140625
3267/3605	At Herlier Planchet who led the column turned to the	187.68357849121094
3268/3605	Several times Lord de Winter Porthos or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without	198.26795959472656
3269/3605	The travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to	301.0570068359375
3270/3605	The storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horse	541.317138671875
3271/3605	A little before they came to Fromelles the storm	1031.5020751953125
3272/3605	There remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of	977.4450073242188
3273/3605	DArtagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his	23.77149200439453
3274/3605	He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudd	1348.05615234375
3275/3605	The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his	277.5584411621094
3276/3605	Has she left Armentières   Grimaud made a sign in the	88.93692016601562
3277/3605	I have charged myself with this	204.95103454589844
3278/3605	It is for me then to interrogate Grim	83.42442321777344
3279/3605	Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the	147.59007263183594
3280/3605	Grimaud showed his master his forefinger	1271.4072265625
3281/3605	Gentlemen said Athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the	120.28530883789062
3282/3605	Grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the caval	1190.0479736328125
3283/3605	At the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they for	379.7936706542969
3284/3605	By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquin	2012.4354248046875
3285/3605	Grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a	212.43397521972656
3286/3605	At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards	187.60243225097656
3287/3605	He pointed his finger to the lighted	221.12306213378906
3288/3605	While I watched the window he guarded the	264.58892822265625
3289/3605	Athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to Grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the	53.24546432495117
3290/3605	The little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet	541.3137817382812
3291/3605	Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the halfcurtains closely	248.64532470703125
3292/3605	He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the	1717.2469482421875
3293/3605	By the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying	183.23094177246094
3294/3605	Her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as	673.4478759765625
3295/3605	He could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of Ath	66.89875793457031
3296/3605	He was not deceived it was she whom he	128.32904052734375
3297/3605	Milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos and	203.9508819580078
3298/3605	Athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and	161.44093322753906
3299/3605	The squares were broken to shivers and Athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the	245.19253540039062
3300/3605	Milady rushed to the door and opened	77.99313354492188
3301/3605	More pale and menacing than Athos DArtagnan stood on the	65.73773956298828
3302/3605	DArtagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but Athos raised his	111.31253051757812
3303/3605	Put back that weapon DArtagnan said he this woman must be tried not	215.35211181640625
3304/3605	Wait an instant my friend and you shall be	46.537017822265625
3305/3605	DArtagnan obeyed for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord	120.02919006347656
3306/3605	Behind DArtagnan entered Porthos Aramis Lord de Winter and the man in the red	30.820505142211914
3307/3605	The four lackeys guarded the door and the	210.94065856933594
3308/3605	Milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible appar	255.1060791015625
3309/3605	Perceiving her brotherinlaw she uttered a terrible	145.4083709716797
3310/3605	We want said Athos Charlotte Backson who first was called Comtesse de la Fère and afterwards Milady de Winter Baroness of	3991.553955078125
3311/3605	That is I that is I murmured Milady in extreme terror what do you want   We wish to judge you according to your crime said Athos you shall be free to defend	89.73603057861328
3312/3605	dArtagnan it is for you to accuse her	87.8484878540039
3313/3605	Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux who died yesterday	1225.16552734375
3314/3605	We bear witness to this said the two Musketeers with one	304.42559814453125
3315/3605	DArtagnan continued Before God and before men I accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from Villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my	409.6953125
3316/3605	God preserved me but a man named Brisemont died in my	1440.598388671875

3318/3605	Before God and before men I accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the Baron de Wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation I attest it	813.1234130859375
3319/3605	And DArtagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aram	12.769524574279785
3320/3605	Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of	204.20399475097656
3321/3605	The Duke of Buckingham assassinated cried all present with one	1737.472900390625

3324/3605	And at this moment perhaps Felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury   A shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown	356.75677490234375
3325/3605	That is not all resumed Lord de	135.45338439941406

3329/3605	And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of DArtagnan leaving the place free for another	145.05621337890625
3330/3605	Milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vert	470.0702209472656
3331/3605	My turn said Athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpentmy	190.9813690185547
3332/3605	Oh said Milady raising herself I defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against	980.9375610351562

3334/3605	It is for me to reply to that And the man in the red cloak came forward in his	98.822998046875
3335/3605	What man is that What man is that cried Milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if	447.45489501953125
3336/3605	All eyes were turned towards this manfor to all except Athos he was	182.03280639648438
3337/3605	Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then	86.24420928955078
3338/3605	After approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his	252.40235900878906
3339/3605	Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impass	321.2633361816406
3340/3605	Then she suddenly cried Oh no no rising and retreating to the very	543.1858520507812

3342/3605	Who are you then cried all the witnesses of this	126.48860931396484
3343/3605	Everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the	59.69081115722656
3344/3605	Oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her	345.2689514160156

3346/3605	Yes I am the executioner of Lille and this is my	139.77699279785156
3347/3605	All eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious	170.89353942871094
3348/3605	That woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is	248.018310546875
3349/3605	She was a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Temple	2090.83544921875
3350/3605	A young priest with a simple and trustful heart performed the duties of the church of that	394.5280456542969

3441/3605	Milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her	481.75787353515625
3442/3605	On coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to	344.68743896484375
3443/3605	But the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her	227.0387725830078
3444/3605	She was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasp	243.8522491455078
3445/3605	Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large	528.102783203125
3446/3605	The two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the	414.2593078613281
3447/3605	The executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat	226.5959930419922

3451/3605	Prodigiously replied Athos in the name of himself and his	139.29095458984375
3452/3605	CONCLUSION     On the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of Buckinghams	163.86148071289062

3454/3605	The joy of the king was	236.68148803710938
3455/3605	He did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the	437.6094970703125
3456/3605	like every weak mind was wanting in	1215.86376953125
3457/3605	But the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain	404.24200439453125
3458/3605	He felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did	1104.487060546875
3459/3605	The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to	1745.2198486328125
3460/3605	The return to La Rochelle therefore was profoundly	887.7495727539062
3461/3605	Our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads	1562.068115234375
