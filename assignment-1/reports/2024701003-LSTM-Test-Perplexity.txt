6/3605	DArtagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal	114.18306732177734
7/3605	Although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by	88.84066772460938
8/3605	His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the	353.6954650878906
9/3605	Still further De Wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his Eminence and DArtagnan knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his	133.70050048828125
10/3605	If De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable I may consider myself almost as a condemned man said DArtagnan shaking his	117.00884246826172
11/3605	But why has he waited till now Thats all plain	612.5880126953125
12/3605	Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup	1084.275634765625
13/3605	Fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a	63.186580657958984
14/3605	Nevertheless Monsieur de Trévilles company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all France and before whom the queen is without power and the king without	184.1338653564453
15/3605	DArtagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you   He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antech	67.79884338378906
16/3605	He placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the	101.57971954345703
17/3605	In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards who recognized DArtagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded Jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular	152.65829467773438
18/3605	This smile appeared to DArtagnan to be of bad aug	70.98738861083984
19/3605	The usher returned and made a sign to DArtagnan to follow	28.932600021362305
20/3605	It appeared to the young man that the Guards on seeing him depart chuckled among	2026.1109619140625
21/3605	He traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and	149.05918884277344
22/3605	The usher introduced him and retired without speaking a	342.3627014160156
23/3605	DArtagnan remained standing and examined this	35.11457061767578
24/3605	DArtagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his	382.3563232421875
25/3605	He saw then that he was with a	93.42740631103516
26/3605	At the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written Mirame a Tragedy in Five Acts and raised his	1101.357421875
27/3605	A TERRIBLE VISION     The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a	421.5909423828125
28/3605	No one had a more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu and DArtagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a	74.6826400756836
29/3605	He however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence without too much assurance but also without too much	149.7102508544922
30/3605	Monsieur said the cardinal are you a DArtagnan from Béarn   Yes monseigneur replied the young	43.58129119873047
31/3605	It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital   Yes monseign	52.65784454345703
32/3605	You came through Meung where something befell	1463.0025634765625
33/3605	I dont very well know what but still	358.6435546875
34/3605	Monseigneur said DArtagnan this was what happened to me   Never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate	35.40480422973633
35/3605	You were recommended to Monsieur de Tréville were you not   Yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at Meung   The letter was lost replied his Eminence yes I know	51.02860641479492
36/3605	Since that time many things have happened to	71.295166015625
37/3605	You were walking one day behind the Chartreux when it would have been better if you had been	187.47642517089844
38/3605	Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of Forges they stopped on the road but you continued	395.7095642089844
39/3605	That is all very simple you had business in	255.01983642578125
40/3605	Monseigneur said DArtagnan quite confused I went   Hunting at Windsor or elsewherethat concerns	992.0552978515625
41/3605	I know because it is my office to know	111.41395568847656
42/3605	On your return you were received by an august personage and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave	241.0678253173828
43/3605	DArtagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too	64.66918182373047
44/3605	The day after that you received a visit from Cavois resumed the	678.4408569335938
45/3605	He went to desire you to come to the	80.96038818359375
46/3605	You have not returned that visit and you were	142.6695556640625
47/3605	Monseigneur I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Emin	334.923095703125
48/3605	As a proof remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very	95.54268646240234
49/3605	That was the very evening when the abduction of M	213.4069061279297
50/3605	DArtagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her	65.16958618164062
51/3605	In short continued the cardinal as I have heard nothing of you for some time past I wished to know what you were	56.68531036376953
52/3605	You must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the	126.89408874511719
53/3605	That continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect to	473.2815246582031
54/3605	I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation but you did not	74.09195709228516
55/3605	Fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear	84.2967529296875
56/3605	Sit down there before me DArtagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen	223.11859130859375
57/3605	And the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he ob	77.0336685180664
58/3605	You are brave Monsieur dArtagnan continued his Eminence you are prudent which is still	56.22667694091797
59/3605	I like men of head and	662.749755859375
60/3605	By men of heart I mean men of	569.31982421875
61/3605	But young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy	217.21798706054688
62/3605	Alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while I am	93.18669891357422
63/3605	Yes thats true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more I dont	155.09027099609375
64/3605	Yet you have need I believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if I mistake not you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your	119.31549072265625
65/3605	I am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said DArtagn	26.77737045288086
66/3605	There are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of	126.19943237304688
67/3605	Now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my Guards and a company after the campaign   Ah monseign	272.99090576171875
68/3605	You accept it do you not   Monseigneur replied DArtagnan with an embarrassed	14.834297180175781
69/3605	How You refuse cried the cardinal with aston	126.40245819091797
70/3605	I am in his Majestys Guards monseigneur and I have no reason to be	308.51220703125
71/3605	But it appears to me that my Guardsmineare also his Majestys Guards and whoever serves in a French corps serves the	3792.529541015625
72/3605	Monseigneur your Eminence has ill understood my	337.17462158203125
73/3605	You want a pretext do you not I	253.02403259277344
74/3605	Well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which I offer youso much for the	839.7391967773438
75/3605	As regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know Monsieur dArtagnan that I have received heavy and serious complaints against	123.103271484375
76/3605	You do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings	1124.3870849609375
77/3605	In fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers I have here a whole pile which concerns	133.76458740234375
78/3605	I know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to	167.9276580810547
79/3605	Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of	77.25758361816406
80/3605	Monseigneur your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary I think I have not proved myself worthy of your	65.17676544189453
81/3605	The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed monseign	61.33930206298828
82/3605	I shall serve under the eye of your Eminence and if I have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor	139.40936279296875
83/3605	Everything is best in its time monseign	170.64712524414062
84/3605	Hereafter perhaps I shall have the right of _giving_ myself at present I shall appear to sell	196.54556274414062
85/3605	That is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympath	107.5439224243164
86/3605	Monseigneur   Well well said the cardinal I dont wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our	52.17665481567383
87/3605	We owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself Monsieur dArtagnan for from the moment I withdraw my hand from behind you I would not give an _obolus_ for your	72.47534942626953
88/3605	I will try to do so monseigneur replied the Gascon with a noble	31.666893005371094
89/3605	Remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said Richelieu significantly that it was I who came to seek you and that I did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling	94.48137664794922
90/3605	I shall entertain whatever may happen said DArtagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your Eminence for that which you now do for	88.92789459228516
91/3605	Well let it be then as you have said Monsieur dArtagnan we shall see each other again after the	22.50887680053711
92/3605	Remain neutral monseigneur if you find that I act as becomes a gallant	241.7069854736328
93/3605	Young man said Richelieu if I shall be able to say to you at another time what I have said to you today I promise you to do	29.840660095214844
94/3605	This last expression of Richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed DArtagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a	129.17665100097656
95/3605	The cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened	370.4928283691406
96/3605	He opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed	109.97142791748047
97/3605	DArtagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to	43.657737731933594
98/3605	Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required Athos would no more give him his handAthos would renounce	195.31886291503906
99/3605	It was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds	305.06512451171875
100/3605	DArtagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow	61.73210525512695
101/3605	With a word DArtagnan reassured them and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the PalaisCard	203.29666137695312
102/3605	Returned home with Athos Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but DArtagnan confined himself to telling them that	84.22367095947266
103/3605	de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had	74.57286071777344
104/3605	And you were right cried Aramis and Porthos with one	43.26729965209961
105/3605	Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered	160.51161193847656
106/3605	But when they were alone he said You have done that which you ought to have done DArtagnan but perhaps you have been	37.59368133544922
107/3605	DArtagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited	94.75027465820312
108/3605	The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for	160.4409942626953
109/3605	DArtagnan went to take leave of	19.05134391784668
110/3605	At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day	290.3506164550781
111/3605	de Tréville contented himself with asking DArtagnan if he could do anything for him but DArtagnan answered that he was supplied with all he	42.292545318603516
112/3605	That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of	1498.114501953125
113/3605	Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of	277.6829833984375
114/3605	de Tréville who had been accustomed to associate	95.30371856689453
115/3605	They were parting to meet again when it pleased God and if it pleased	687.5693359375
116/3605	That night then was somewhat riotous as may be	738.2266845703125
117/3605	In such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme care	258.7343444824219

120/3605	Each of the captains then led his company to the Louvre where the king held his	127.42822265625
121/3605	The king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty	1306.91552734375

124/3605	The review over the Guards set forward alone on their march the Musketeers waiting for the king which allowed Porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux O	392.8893127441406
125/3605	The procurators wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine	457.1418762207031

131/3605	He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the	280.64569091796875

145/3605	THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE     The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis	7246.4541015625
146/3605	and one of the great military enterprises of the	124.5656509399414
147/3605	It is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in	230.83877563476562
148/3605	The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were	2352.064208984375
149/3605	Let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the	388.98492431640625

154/3605	La Rochelle which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities was then the focus of dissensions and	914.8821411132812
155/3605	Moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English and by closing it against England our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Gu	440.99127197265625

160/3605	On his side Buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of England was moved by interests exactly like those of the	381.4665222167969

162/3605	Buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador he wished to enter it as a conquer	367.2623596191406
163/3605	It resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from Anne of	430.0848388671875

172/3605	Now whenever the king halted the Musketeers	325.2030029296875
173/3605	It followed that DArtagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friendsAthos Porthos and Aram	110.45951080322266
174/3605	This separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was	134.78138732910156

180/3605	From the time of his arrival in Paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or	129.86965942382812

185/3605	For a mind so perspicuous as that of DArtagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better	144.44198608398438
186/3605	Then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be	242.5545654296875

188/3605	We say the gravel he trod under his feet for DArtagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of Angout	381.0315246582031
189/3605	Now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a	93.703125
190/3605	DArtagnan had a quick eye and a prompt	70.76024627685547
191/3605	He comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly	188.62095642089844
192/3605	He determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another mus	84.0443344116211
193/3605	The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the	64.75015258789062
194/3605	At the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his	60.10096740722656
195/3605	DArtagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the	36.061527252197266
196/3605	DArtagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single	58.32620620727539

201/3605	DArtagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his	49.738563537597656
202/3605	The ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus	767.2196655273438
203/3605	The accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been	148.19570922851562
204/3605	This could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular	316.3183288574219

206/3605	It may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his Eminence with respect to	78.38427734375

212/3605	Nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any	1754.3736572265625

215/3605	At nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to	212.5026397705078
216/3605	The guards were under arms and DArtagnan took his place in the midst of his	31.847335815429688
217/3605	Monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments	194.28195190429688
218/3605	Dessessart captain of the Guards as well as the	1036.89990234375
219/3605	At the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to DArtagnan that	52.81338882446289
220/3605	Dessessart made him a sign to	667.1926879882812
221/3605	He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive	129.54835510253906
222/3605	Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in	74.19670867919922
223/3605	Thanks my captain replied DArtagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant	70.81303405761719
224/3605	In fact the Rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days	369.09295654296875
225/3605	The matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bast	2266.079833984375
226/3605	At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice and said I want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended	170.44976806640625
227/3605	As to the man to be depended upon I have him under my hand monsieur said	90.62278747558594

229/3605	Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said DArtagnan raising his	84.86061096191406
230/3605	Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed	430.0821838378906
231/3605	DArtagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the	272.28265380859375
232/3605	It was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the	331.20428466796875
233/3605	DArtagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two Guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed	260.9622802734375
234/3605	They arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bast	428.3492736816406
235/3605	There on turning round DArtagnan perceived that the two soldiers had	27.42144203186035
236/3605	He thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to	180.7926788330078
237/3605	At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bast	370.96038818359375
238/3605	They saw no one and the bastion seemed	369.1553955078125
239/3605	The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around DArtagnan and his	496.83984375
240/3605	They knew all they wished to know the bastion was	133.77561950683594
241/3605	A longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless impr	224.9901580810547
242/3605	DArtagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a	61.726749420166016
243/3605	On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the Guardsmen	238.31849670410156
244/3605	A ball had passed through his	149.1832733154297
245/3605	The other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the	175.61288452148438
246/3605	DArtagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were	60.72943878173828
247/3605	One ball struck the head of the alreadywounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of DArtagn	235.1699676513672
248/3605	The young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the	142.37326049804688
249/3605	The idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings	145.95860290527344
250/3605	He resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were	57.78255081176758
251/3605	He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two	266.5079040527344
252/3605	DArtagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the	118.28608703613281
253/3605	As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making	143.7561798095703
254/3605	Fortunately deceived by DArtagnans trick they neglected to reload their	686.8352661132812
255/3605	When they were within ten paces of him DArtagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to	75.26956939697266
256/3605	The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the	217.43663024902344
257/3605	One of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a	228.69129943847656
258/3605	He aimed a terrible blow at DArtagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bast	88.88774108886719
259/3605	As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his	131.35855102539062
260/3605	Meantime DArtagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his	78.56905364990234
261/3605	The conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arqu	629.379638671875
262/3605	The sword of the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who	703.7295532226562
263/3605	DArtagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his	29.75290298461914
264/3605	Oh do not kill me cried the band	35.926605224609375
265/3605	Pardon pardon my officer and I will tell you	66.27471923828125
266/3605	Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his	325.54229736328125
267/3605	Yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you	160.14166259765625
268/3605	Wretch cried DArtagnan speak quickly Who employed you to assassinate me   A woman whom I dont know but who is called Mil	79.23612213134766
269/3605	But if you dont know this woman how do you know her name   My comrade knows her and called her	84.25194549560547
270/3605	It was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as I have heard him	207.8747100830078
271/3605	But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair   He proposed to me to undertake it with him and I	117.21440124511719
272/3605	And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise   A hundred lou	80.16221618652344
273/3605	Well come said the young man laughing she thinks I am worth	123.47404479980469
274/3605	A hundred louis Well that was a temptation for two wretches like	206.32431030273438
275/3605	I understand why you accepted it and I grant you my pardon but upon one	185.82855224609375
276/3605	What is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not	111.21369171142578
277/3605	That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his	64.13906860351562
278/3605	But cried the bandit that is only another way of killing	108.76809692382812
279/3605	How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion   You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or I swear you shall die by my	67.4921875
280/3605	Pardon monsieur pity In the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his handfor he began to lose his strength with his	76.29679870605469
281/3605	And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love and that I believed that woman dead asked DArtagn	46.2783317565918
282/3605	By that letter which my comrade has in his	216.456787109375
283/3605	You see then said DArtagnan that I must have that	29.1928768157959
284/3605	Stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of	840.8603515625
285/3605	I will goI will go   DArtagnan took the soldiers arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his	211.77333068847656
286/3605	It was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from	121.00757598876953
287/3605	Terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that DArtagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt Stop said he I will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as	62.66950988769531
288/3605	Stay where you are I will go	72.6093521118164
289/3605	And with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground DArtagnan succeeded in reaching the second	97.755126953125
290/3605	There were two means of gaining his objectto search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the	508.302978515625
291/3605	DArtagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy	300.05682373046875
292/3605	A slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to DArtagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his	280.71087646484375
293/3605	DArtagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as	113.02172088623047
294/3605	A leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead	168.08233642578125
295/3605	He left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocket	137.02450561523438
296/3605	If you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from	160.41015625
297/3605	Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Mil	237.6600799560547
298/3605	He consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded	171.3889617919922
299/3605	But what were you to do with that woman asked DArtagnan with	35.9718017578125
300/3605	We were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the Place Royale said the wounded	84.40483093261719
301/3605	There could be no doubt she owed this information to the	130.01316833496094
302/3605	But amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor M	150.6059112548828
303/3605	Bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of Chaillot like an apparition were now	143.2155303955078
304/3605	Then also as Athos had predicted it became possible to find M	371.9157409667969
305/3605	Bonacieux and a convent was not impregn	52.02106475830078
306/3605	This idea completely restored clemency to his	910.3233642578125
307/3605	He turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said Come I will not abandon you	69.02300262451172
308/3605	Lean upon me and let us return to the	37.03731155395508
309/3605	Yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged   You have my word said he for the second time I give you your	70.70362091064453
310/3605	The wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but DArtagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his	222.48794555664062
311/3605	The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four	250.15660095214844
312/3605	They were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and	166.194091796875
313/3605	DArtagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_ which he	748.907958984375
314/3605	He described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had	134.71270751953125
315/3605	This recital was for him the occasion of veritable	255.83282470703125
316/3605	The whole army talked of this expedition for a day and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon	173.98545837402344
317/3605	Besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of DArtagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had	443.6864318847656
318/3605	In fact DArtagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his	73.27860260009766
319/3605	This tranquillity proved one thingthat DArtagnan did not yet know Mil	99.9648208618164
320/3605	Martin and the fort of La Prée as on their side the French were besieging La Roc	1499.9815673828125
321/3605	DArtagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have	190.02854919433594
322/3605	He only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his	163.9969482421875
323/3605	But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything was explained to him by this letter dated from Villeroy  	107.619384765625
324/3605	They are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite	173.38180541992188
325/3605	I have done this and am monsieur with great respect     Your very humble and obedient servant GODEAU _Purveyor of the Musketeers_     Thats all well cried DArtagn	409.2132568359375
326/3605	They think of me in their pleasures as I thought of them in my	354.69195556640625
327/3605	Well I will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but I will not drink	82.59534454345703
328/3605	And DArtagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from Viller	317.2305603027344
329/3605	One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after	309.2446594238281
330/3605	The hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the	200.76010131835938
331/3605	Planchet waited towel on arm Fourreau uncorked the bottles and Brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decan	3141.066650390625
332/3605	Of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom Brisemont poured the lees into a glass and DArtagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his	258.8418273925781
333/3605	The guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis and Fort Ne	381.04931640625
334/3605	The Guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the English sprang to their	650.7149047851562
335/3605	DArtagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their	110.18742370605469
336/3605	But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this	90.21427917480469
337/3605	Cries of Live the king Live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all	376.310546875
338/3605	In short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand	775.6259155273438
339/3605	DArtagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and	114.86952209472656
340/3605	de Tréville who detected him at	125.24320220947266
341/3605	The ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers	431.86163330078125
342/3605	_Pardieu_ cried DArtagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner cannot have had time to get cold Can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two Guards whom he introduced to his	127.37281799316406
343/3605	Ah ah said Porthos it appears we are feasting   I hope said Aramis there are no women at your	53.67991638183594
344/3605	Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked Ath	391.8440246582031
345/3605	Well _pardieu_ there is yours my dear friend replied DArtagn	16.619028091430664
346/3605	We sent you wine   You know very wellthe wine from the hills of Anj	291.6414489746094
347/3605	Yes I know what brand you are talking	136.00662231445312
348/3605	Well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with	272.8639831542969
349/3605	And so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some Anjou wine said Porth	180.17520141601562
350/3605	Not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your	214.2012939453125
351/3605	On our account said the three Musket	127.42767333984375
352/3605	Did you send this wine Aramis said Ath	75.50602722167969
353/3605	No and you Porthos   No and you Athos   No   If it was not you it was your purveyor said DArtagn	28.01850700378418
354/3605	Our purveyor   Yes your purveyor Godeauthe purveyor of the Musket	151.8570556640625
355/3605	My faith never mind where it comes from said Porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink	86.4028091430664
356/3605	No said Athos dont let us drink wine which comes from an unknown	121.43791961669922
357/3605	Did none of you charge your purveyor Godeau to send me some wine   No And yet you say he has sent you some as from us   Here is his letter said DArtagnan and he presented the note to his	106.07727813720703
358/3605	This is not his writing said Ath	65.9342041015625
359/3605	I am acquainted with it before we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the	145.40164184570312
360/3605	A false letter altogether said Porthos we have not been	491.91064453125
361/3605	DArtagnan said Aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance   DArtagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his	46.03511047363281
362/3605	DArtagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three Musketeers and the two Guards following	156.43789672851562
363/3605	The first object that met the eyes of DArtagnan on entering the room was Brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convuls	290.10882568359375
364/3605	Planchet and Fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was uselessall the features of the dying man were distorted with	259.68841552734375
365/3605	Ah cried he on perceiving DArtagnan ah this is frightful You pretend to pardon me and you poison me   I cried DArtagn	41.23817443847656
366/3605	I wretch What do you say   I say that it was you who gave me the wine I say that it was you who desired me to drink	25.14389419555664
367/3605	I say you wished to avenge yourself on me and I say that it is horrible   Do not think so Brisemont said DArtagnan do not think	63.01753616333008
368/3605	I do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tort	242.03131103515625
369/3605	Frightful frightful murmured Athos while Porthos broke the bottles and Aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent	73.09827423095703
370/3605	Oh my friends said DArtagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these	50.25291061401367
371/3605	Gentlemen continued he addressing the Guardsmen I request you will be silent with regard to this	697.0993041992188
372/3605	Great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon	323.9414978027344
373/3605	Alas said Fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror I wanted to get him out of the way that I might drink	422.9591369628906
374/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan addressing the Guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day I beg of	190.08326721191406
375/3605	The two Guardsmen courteously accepted DArtagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone	232.9204559326172
376/3605	When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their	213.72268676757812
377/3605	In the first place said Athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent	117.4141616821289
378/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan I commit the corpse of this poor devil to your	40.71767044067383
379/3605	Let him be interred in holy	309.371337890625
380/3605	He committed a crime it is true but he repented of	158.4133758544922
381/3605	And the four friends quit the room leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisem	2604.240234375
382/3605	The host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which Athos went himself to draw at the	313.7876281738281
383/3605	In a few words Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the	28.711627960205078
384/3605	Well said DArtagnan to Athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the	24.324838638305664
385/3605	Yes yes replied he I perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she   I am sure of	34.84463882446289
386/3605	But the _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder   She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France and has been branded in	494.8919982910156
387/3605	Athos she is your wife I tell you repeated DArtagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each	286.4490966796875
388/3605	Yes but I should think the other must be dead I hanged her so effect	149.6368865966797
389/3605	It was DArtagnan who now shook his head in his	26.33631134033203
390/3605	But in either case what is to be done said the young	37.53310775756836
391/3605	The fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said Ath	223.52813720703125
392/3605	We must extricate ourselves from this	232.5843963623047
393/3605	But how   Listen You must try to see her and have an explanation with	87.07913970947266
394/3605	Say to her Peace or war My word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to	337.0095520019531
395/3605	I like the means well enough said DArtagnan but where and how to meet with her   Time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of	418.03826904296875
396/3605	The more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to	300.8397521972656
397/3605	Yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poison	600.6679077148438
398/3605	God has preserved us hitherto God will preserve us	892.0365600585938
399/3605	Besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but _she_ asked he in an undert	177.7334442138672
400/3605	Madame Bonacieux Ah thats true said Ath	128.2537841796875
401/3605	My poor friend I had forgotten you were in	125.93439483642578
402/3605	I am only temporarily a Musketeer said Aramis hum	201.84986877441406
403/3605	It is some time since we heard from his mistress said Athos in a low	40.82670974731445
404/3605	But take no notice we know all about	222.94598388671875
405/3605	Well said Porthos it appears to me that the means are very	27.853214263916016
406/3605	You say she is in a convent replied Porth	34.70779037475586
407/3605	As soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that	515.6966552734375
408/3605	But we must first learn what convent she is	262.9391784667969
409/3605	But I think I have it said Ath	28.788789749145508
410/3605	Dont you say dear DArtagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her   I believe so at	32.749446868896484
411/3605	In that case Porthos will assist	65.80645751953125
412/3605	And how so if you please   Why by your marchioness your duchess your	102.61834716796875
413/3605	Hush said Porthos placing a finger on his	45.22478485107422
414/3605	I believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the	114.39588165283203
415/3605	Then said Aramis I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of	115.77745819091797
416/3605	You And how   By the queens almoner to whom I am very intimately allied said Aramis	496.13623046875
417/3605	And on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that	140.8295440673828
418/3605	DArtagnan returned to less important affairs and the three Musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their	169.5820770263672
419/3605	Bassompierre and Schomberg against the Duc dAngoulê	4086.195556640625
420/3605	The result was that to prevent	6412.27392578125
421/3605	Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to	1970.719482421875
422/3605	Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between Leu and Dompierre the Duc dAngoulême on the east from Dompierre to Perigny and	412.3289794921875
423/3605	de Schomberg on the south from Perigny to Angout	5008.4501953125
424/3605	The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at Estrée sometimes at Jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of La Pierre in a simple house without any entrench	1214.0087890625
425/3605	So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre the king the Duc dAngoulême and the cardinal	148.1064910888672
426/3605	As soon as this organization was established they set about driving the English from the	603.6964111328125
427/3605	The English who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their	1685.86181640625
428/3605	The result was that even if the kings troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other Buckingham who only continued in the Isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the	195.4406280517578
429/3605	de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive	164.1399688720703
430/3605	Simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre	160.87449645996094
431/3605	Te Deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout	2732.314453125
432/3605	The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the	138.6576385498047
433/3605	But it must be acknowledged this response was but moment	623.3648681640625
434/3605	An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham named Montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire Spain England and Lor	1461.4637451171875
435/3605	Still further in Buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised M	2742.185546875
436/3605	It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without	602.56787109375
437/3605	All therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of	278.5865478515625
438/3605	The cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of	352.91162109375
439/3605	If the league which threatened France triumphed all his influence would be	816.1719970703125
440/3605	Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre where they had as yet but partisans and he Richelieuthe French minister the national ministerwould be	1440.4940185546875
441/3605	The king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the	127.68959045410156
442/3605	He would then be lost and France perhaps with	185.93411254882812
443/3605	Courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre in which the cardinal had established his	324.2286071777344
444/3605	There were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been	311.3256530761719
445/3605	It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies	453.0355529785156
446/3605	On their part the Musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous	148.83596801757812
447/3605	This was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of	180.7000274658203
448/3605	de Tréville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the	271.2274475097656
449/3605	They immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the	1221.4853515625
450/3605	In an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go	201.01864624023438
451/3605	The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and Athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice Who goes there   Who goes there yourselves replied one of the horse	99.7120361328125
452/3605	That is not an answer replied Ath	41.45640182495117
453/3605	Who goes there Answer or we	2903.7802734375
454/3605	Beware of what you are about gentlemen said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to	201.34039306640625
455/3605	It is some superior officer making his night rounds said Ath	1409.8758544921875
456/3605	What do you wish gentlemen   Who are you said the same voice in the same commanding	66.52678680419922
457/3605	Answer in your turn or you may repent of your	702.8867797851562
458/3605	Kings Musketeers said Athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do	66.52044677734375
459/3605	What company   Company of Tré	1179.627197265625
460/3605	Advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this	115.4054183959961
461/3605	The three companions advanced rather humblyfor all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselvesleaving Athos the post of	413.5738525390625
462/3605	One of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his	109.15538024902344
463/3605	Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced	35.67198181152344
464/3605	Your pardon my officer said Athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good	125.97289276123047
465/3605	Your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his	72.3272476196289
466/3605	But yourself monsieur said Athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me I beg you the proof that you have the right to question	48.03544235229492
467/3605	Your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face	158.5895538330078
468/3605	Monsieur the Cardinal cried the stupefied Musket	84.43091583251953
469/3605	Your name cried his Eminence for the third	118.5230484008789
470/3605	The cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew	83.15962982177734
471/3605	These three Musketeers shall follow us said he in an undert	71.40753936767578
472/3605	I am not willing it should be known I have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell	93.19528198242188
473/3605	We are gentlemen monseigneur said Athos require our parole and give yourself no uneas	159.66383361816406
474/3605	Thank God we can keep a	245.8255157470703
475/3605	The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous	678.8936157226562
476/3605	You have a quick ear Monsieur Athos said the cardinal but now listen to	67.29147338867188
477/3605	It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow me but for my	170.85150146484375
478/3605	Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and Aram	72.26453399658203
479/3605	Yes your Eminence said Athos while the two Musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in	161.47889709472656
480/3605	I know you gentlemen said the cardinal I know	33.20752716064453
481/3605	I know you are not quite my friends and I am sorry you are not so but I know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in	52.422332763671875
482/3605	Monsieur Athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty if we should meet	63.880699157714844
483/3605	The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their	223.0878448486328
484/3605	Well upon my honor said Athos your Eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several illlooking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those	357.6934509277344
485/3605	A quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know I dont like quarrel	244.32781982421875
486/3605	And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in	90.02554321289062
487/3605	What have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his	133.86508178710938
488/3605	My friend Aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your Eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your Eminence orders an escal	510.32696533203125
489/3605	But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the	339.20294189453125
490/3605	Come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody Confess you know I have the right of giving abs	513.3714599609375
491/3605	I did not even draw my sword but I took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the	98.30099487304688
492/3605	It appears that in falling continued Athos with some hesitation he broke his	220.36244201660156
493/3605	Ah ah said the cardinal and you Monsieur Porthos   I monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibitedI seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder is	85.2288589477539
494/3605	Then I admit my patience failed me I drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his	113.12810516357422
495/3605	I only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two	74.01765441894531
496/3605	The devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed _hors de combat_ in a cabaret squabble You dont do your work by	1065.9737548828125
497/3605	And pray what was this quarrel about   These fellows were drunk said Athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her	167.80758666992188
498/3605	Force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose   To do her violence without doubt said Ath	87.15840148925781
499/3605	I have had the honor of informing your Eminence that these men were	109.28787994384766
500/3605	And was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of	133.05947875976562
501/3605	We did not see her monseigneur said Ath	20.955787658691406
502/3605	You did not see her Ah very well replied the cardinal	83.30672454833984
503/3605	You did well to defend the honor of a woman and as I am going to the Red Dovecot myself I shall know if you have told me the	179.07772827148438
504/3605	Monseigneur said Athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a	53.70069885253906
505/3605	Judge not rashly says the Gospel replied the	1045.6839599609375
506/3605	And now gentlemen thats well continued the	587.0971069335938
507/3605	I know what I wish to know follow	53.522315979003906
508/3605	The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four	110.7796401977539
509/3605	They soon arrived at the silent solitary	767.7755737304688
510/3605	No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the	1319.02490234375
511/3605	Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to	45.917720794677734
512/3605	A saddled horse was fastened to the window	409.140869140625
513/3605	The cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar	219.60594177246094
514/3605	A man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of Surgères which was likewise the way to	140.8500213623047
515/3605	You have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the Musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to	89.83433532714844
516/3605	The cardinal alighted the three Musketeers did	148.98239135742188
517/3605	The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shut	64.97921752929688
518/3605	For him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a	213.8070831298828
519/3605	Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the	191.5838165283203
520/3605	The host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chim	102.75853729248047
521/3605	Enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me I shall not be more than half an	32.979827880859375
522/3605	And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to	121.34432220458984
523/3605	Now who was that someone That was the question the three Musketeers put to one	164.09347534179688
524/3605	Then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject Porthos called the host and asked for	235.5751495361328
525/3605	Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to	20.051517486572266
526/3605	Athos walked about in a contemplative	5881.2099609375
527/3605	While thinking and walking Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his	209.55685424804688
528/3605	Athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower or	115.63318634033203
529/3605	Listen Milady said the cardinal the affair is	98.24466705322266
530/3605	Sit down and let us talk it	149.89926147460938
531/3605	I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the Musketeer	444.5811767578125
532/3605	A small vessel with an English crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of Charente at Fort La Point	412.39013671875
533/3605	Fort La Pointe or Fort Vasou was not built until 1672 nearly 50 years	34354.015625
534/3605	I must go thither tonight   Instantly That is to say when you have received my	118.21627044677734
535/3605	Two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as	201.93295288085938
536/3605	You will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your	44.93189239501953
537/3605	Now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of your Eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that I may not commit an	137.0723419189453
538/3605	There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocut	133.0921630859375
539/3605	It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be	225.60755920410156
540/3605	Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with	91.8222427368164
541/3605	The two Musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Ath	174.7138214111328
542/3605	All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the	159.44781494140625
543/3605	You will go to London continued the	80.49185180664062
544/3605	Arrived in London you will seek	1098.3040771484375
545/3605	I must beg your Eminence to observe said Milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his Grace distrusts	413.9518737792969
546/3605	Well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a	359.3025817871094
547/3605	Frankly and loyally repeated Milady with an unspeakable expression of dupl	439.7852478027344
548/3605	Yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same	176.94752502441406
549/3605	All this negotiation must be carried on	857.5911865234375
550/3605	I will follow your Eminences instructions to the	328.5707092285156
551/3605	I only wait till you give	143.30699157714844
552/3605	You will go to Buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him I am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes I will ruin the	62.68523406982422
553/3605	Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made   Yes for I have the	220.8983612060547
554/3605	I must be able to present these proofs for his	421.0569152832031
555/3605	And you will tell him I will publish the report of BoisRobert and the Marquis de Beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a mas	342.5669860839844
556/3605	You will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the Great Mogul which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pist	97.61231994628906
557/3605	Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power that Montague is in the Bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not	359.5733337402344
558/3605	You recollect perfectly all I have told you do you not   Your Eminence will judge the ball of Madame the Constable the night at the Louvre the evening at Amiens the arrest of Montague the letter of Madame de Chevre	156.44944763183594
559/3605	Thats it said the cardinal thats	192.36170959472656
560/3605	But resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace France   The duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied Richelieu with great	260.658447265625
561/3605	Like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady	532.0310668945312
562/3605	If he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says I will answer for it he will look	105.9964370727539
563/3605	And yet said Milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists   If he persists said the	197.36244201660156
564/3605	If he persists His Eminence made a pause and resumed If he persistswell then I shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of	258.41650390625
565/3605	If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said Milady perhaps I should partake of your confidence as to the	301.4920349121094
566/3605	Well here for example said Richelieu when in 1610 for a cause similar to that which moves the duke King Henry	487.2386779785156
567/3605	of glorious memory was about at the same time to invade Flanders and Italy in order to attack Austria on both	549.512451171875
568/3605	Ay and observeit just occurs to me that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham and their preachers designate him as the Antich	3939.441650390625
569/3605	Well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the d	104.55827331542969
570/3605	The duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidel	563.0628051757812
571/3605	No doubt said Milady coolly such a woman may be	206.52528381347656
572/3605	Well such a woman who would place the knife of Jacques Clément or of Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save	1358.4068603515625
573/3605	Yes but she would then be the accomplice of an	55.2025260925293
574/3605	Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clément ever known   No for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they	1339.274658203125
575/3605	The Palace of Justice would not be burned down for everybody monseign	264.9315490722656
576/3605	You think then that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused by chance asked Richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no	117.16740417480469
577/3605	I think nothing I quote a fact that is	330.8182067871094
578/3605	Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier or the Queen Marie de Médicis I should use less precautions than I take being simply called Milady Clar	700.0172729492188
579/3605	What do you require then   I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should think proper to do for the greatest good of	91.5366439819336
580/3605	But in the first place this woman I have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the d	78.01939392089844
581/3605	Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of Gods	858.1622314453125
582/3605	Well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now	100.97947692871094
583/3605	Then if he persists notwithstanding all thisas that is as I have said the limit of my missionI shall have nothing to do but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of	175.38217163085938
584/3605	That is it is it not monseigneur and I shall have nothing else to do   That is it replied the cardinal dry	27.840084075927734
585/3605	Yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for I made them by serving your Emin	151.2457733154297
586/3605	In the first place there is a little _intrigante_ named Bonacie	240.48712158203125
587/3605	She is in the prison of N	943.6657104492188
588/3605	That is to say she was there replied Milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a	67.2851791381836
589/3605	And to which   I dont know the secret has been well	113.43097686767578
590/3605	But _I_ will know   And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is   I can see nothing inconvenient in that said the	150.91732788085938
591/3605	Well now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little Madame Bonacie	114.8268051147461
592/3605	Who is that   Her	115.13909912109375
593/3605	What is his name   Oh your Eminence knows him well cried Milady carried away by her	198.912841796875
594/3605	He is the evil genius of both of	293.6392822265625
595/3605	Ah ah said the cardinal I know of whom you	68.26819610595703
596/3605	He is a bold fellow said the	63.30672836303711
597/3605	And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be	68.23174285888672
598/3605	I must have said the duke a proof of his connection with	76.00836944580078
599/3605	A proof cried Milady I will have	344.7660217285156
600/3605	Well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and I will send him to the Bast	137.6237335205078
601/3605	So far good monseigneur but afterwards   When once in the Bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low	85.46759796142578
602/3605	Ah _pardieu_ continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity   Monseigneur replied Milady a fair	75.0362777709961
603/3605	Life for life man for man give me one I will give you the	151.4667510986328
604/3605	An infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel   Give me paper a quill and some ink then said the	85.90973663330078
605/3605	There was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing	110.2733154296875
606/3605	Athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the	35.32295227050781
607/3605	Well said Porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation   Hush said Athos speaking in a low	17.028839111328125
608/3605	We have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides I dont prevent you from listening but I must be	143.01953125
609/3605	I will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire	128.4998779296875
610/3605	The rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about	621.9842529296875
611/3605	Be easy on that head replied Athos you know I am cool	148.5397491455078
612/3605	Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stove	267.5494689941406
613/3605	A CONJUGAL SCENE     As Athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came	2010.0465087890625
614/3605	He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were and found Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aram	87.61329650878906
615/3605	He cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was	63.46035385131836
616/3605	What has become of Monseigneur Athos asked	51.59741973876953
617/3605	Monseigneur replied Porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not	131.8729248046875
618/3605	And you what have you done Monsieur Porthos   I have won five pistoles of Aram	39.00644302368164

621/3605	The attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the brid	50.520240783691406
622/3605	At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the	95.51703643798828
623/3605	These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to Fort La Pointe and superintend her embark	722.7015991210938
624/3605	The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Ath	85.93144989013672
625/3605	The cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in	416.49609375
626/3605	Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two Musketeers and return to Ath	55.08441162109375
627/3605	For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little	132.36102294921875
628/3605	My officer said Athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forget	112.8135757446289
629/3605	Go up said the host she is still in her	87.66068267822266
630/3605	Athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived Milady putting on her	238.83702087402344
631/3605	He entered the chamber and closed the door behind	38.148399353027344
632/3605	At the noise he made in pushing the bolt Milady turned	314.30035400390625
633/3605	Athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his	77.6427001953125
634/3605	On seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue Milady was	353.9855041503906
635/3605	Who are you and what do you want cried	58.12841033935547
636/3605	Humph murmured Athos it is certainly she   And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward Mil	167.20956420898438
637/3605	Do you know me madame said	29.460790634155273
638/3605	Milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a	89.85832977294922
639/3605	So far well said Athos I perceive you know	83.99629974365234
640/3605	The Comte de la Fère murmured Milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any	295.3000793457031
641/3605	Yes Milady replied Athos the Comte de la Fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a	58.022178649902344
642/3605	Sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal	93.59957122802734
643/3605	Milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a	93.4759292602539
644/3605	You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said Ath	159.57774353027344
645/3605	Your power is great I know but you also know that with the help of God men have often conquered the most terrible	211.48724365234375
646/3605	You have once before thrown yourself in my	319.1011657714844
647/3605	I thought I had crushed you madame but either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you   Milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed gro	137.6455841064453
648/3605	Yes hell has resuscitated you continued Ath	222.8835906982422
649/3605	Hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your	432.34564208984375
650/3605	Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed	358.020751953125
651/3605	You believed me to be dead did you not as I believed you to be And the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fère as the name Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breu	178.92630004882812
652/3605	Was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us Our position is truly a strange one continued Athos	602.5205078125
653/3605	We have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes dev	532.3483276367188
654/3605	But said Milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me   I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes I have not lost sight of	51.07269287109375
655/3605	You know what I have done   I can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this	70.90217590332031
656/3605	A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Mil	90.0576171875
657/3605	Perhaps said Athos But at all events listen well to	122.88662719726562
658/3605	Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedI care very little about that I dont know	151.831787109375
659/3605	Athos was seized with a kind of vert	131.76380920410156
660/3605	The sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembr	299.2353820800781
661/3605	He thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his	114.18062591552734
662/3605	His desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked	237.39810180664062
663/3605	Milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild	172.11753845214844
664/3605	Motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of	211.70315551757812
665/3605	With another man Milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew Ath	207.55519104003906
666/3605	You have one second to decide said	378.4941711425781
667/3605	Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward Ath	93.84415435791016
668/3605	Take it said she and be accursed   Athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read  	78.89567565917969
669/3605	3 1627     It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	84.87152862548828
670/3605	RICHELIEU     And now said Athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that I have drawn your teeth viper bite if you	451.1430358886719
671/3605	And he left the chamber without once looking behind	204.7315673828125
672/3605	At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they	112.5546875
673/3605	Gentlemen said he Monseigneurs order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to Fort La Pointe and never to leave her till she is on	622.761474609375
674/3605	As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of ass	195.575439453125
675/3605	With regard to Athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to	109.19957733154297
676/3605	In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the	112.34300231933594
677/3605	He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his	43.9028205871582
678/3605	He immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the	123.63636779785156
679/3605	Who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horse	82.0094223022461
680/3605	That is our brave Musketeer I think said the	78.27058410644531
681/3605	Yes monseigneur said Porthos it is	9.427789688110352
682/3605	Monsieur Athos said Richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have	87.47409057617188
683/3605	Gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the	761.955078125
684/3605	Saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendantfor that night he himself slept in the	106.05154418945312
685/3605	Well said Porthos and Aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required   I know it said Athos coolly since here it	61.030887603759766
686/3605	And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentin	108.03199768066406
687/3605	Only they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the Musket	60.04820251464844
688/3605	Milady as Athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following	153.7673797607422
689/3605	She had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of Ath	78.81903839111328
690/3605	She might say that Athos had hanged her but then Athos would tell that she was	281.8606262207031
691/3605	She thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her	215.0255126953125
692/3605	THE BASTION SAINTGERVAIS     On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends DArtagnan found them assembled in the same	2568.946533203125
693/3605	Athos was meditating Porthos was twisting his mustache Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours bound in blue	931.7799682617188
694/3605	I hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else I warn you I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bast	172.63546752929688
695/3605	Ah why were you not there gentlemen It was warm	420.4271545410156
696/3605	We were in a place where it was not very cold replied Porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to	102.11027526855469
697/3605	Oh oh said DArtagnan comprehending the slight frown of the Musket	37.24616622924805
698/3605	It appears there is something fresh	450.4919128417969
699/3605	Aramis said Athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot I believe  	64.9498519897461
700/3605	How did you fare   For my part I ate but	159.4437255859375
701/3605	The day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but	331.7662048339844
702/3605	What said Athos no fish at a seaport   They say said Aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open	488.1067199707031
703/3605	But that is not quite what I mean to ask you Aramis replied Ath	32.5633430480957
704/3605	I want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted	106.67227172851562
705/3605	Why I think there were not many intr	2962.796630859375
706/3605	Yes Athos I know what you mean we shall do very well at the Parpaill	79.51809692382812
707/3605	Let us go to the Parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of	401.6588439941406
708/3605	DArtagnan who was accustomed to his friends manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took Athoss arm and went out without saying	102.50092315673828
709/3605	Athos made him a sign to come with	97.59537506103516
710/3605	Grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to	379.2400817871094
711/3605	They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaill	618.0777587890625
712/3605	It was seven oclock in the morning and daylight began to	38.965721130371094
713/3605	The three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be	132.23947143554688
714/3605	Unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private	1007.9998168945312
715/3605	The morning drum had just been beaten everyone shook off the drowsiness of night and to dispel the humid morning air came to take a drop at the	704.8690185546875
716/3605	Dragoons Swiss Guardsmen Musketeers lighthorsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four	910.3098754882812
717/3605	Thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their	1100.4339599609375
718/3605	I see how it will be said Athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just	57.10936737060547
719/3605	DArtagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours	168.35081481933594
720/3605	Ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped	376.6733703613281
721/3605	I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the Rochella	234.76136779785156
722/3605	DArtagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their	128.37744140625
723/3605	Well said Athos dont you hear Monsieur de Busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question Relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know	116.69224548339844
724/3605	Have you not taken a bastion said a Swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer	418.67822265625
725/3605	Yes monsieur said DArtagnan bowing we have had that	13.727274894714355
726/3605	We even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty	531.4147338867188
727/3605	Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly	200.85546875
728/3605	And what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be	447.6484680175781
729/3605	Gervais replied DArtagnan from behind which the Rochellais annoyed our work	146.90345764160156
730/3605	Was that affair hot   Yes moderately	1169.5880126953125
731/3605	We lost five men and the Rochellais eight or	291.06268310546875
732/3605	_Balzempleu_ said the Swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the German language had acquired a habit of swearing in	1319.817626953125
733/3605	But it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bast	536.818359375
734/3605	Gentlemen said Athos a wager   Ah _wooi_ a vager cried the	273.4812927246094
735/3605	Stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit I am in	681.9248657226562
736/3605	You cursed host a dripping pan immediately that I may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable	529.5802612304688
737/3605	You was right said the Swiss goose grease is kood with bas	41176.84375
738/3605	Now for the wager We listen Monsieur Ath	149.88339233398438
739/3605	Well Monsieur de Busigny I will bet you said Athos that my three companions Messieurs Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion	72.22881317138672
740/3605	Gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge	616.7147216796875
741/3605	Porthos and Aramis looked at each other they began to	15.17242431640625
742/3605	But said DArtagnan in the ear of Athos you are going to get us all killed without	30.080337524414062
743/3605	We are much more likely to be killed said Athos if we do not	37.09010314941406
744/3605	My faith gentlemen said Porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache thats a fair bet I	168.908447265625
745/3605	de Busigny so let us fix the	697.1435546875
746/3605	You are four gentlemen said Athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for	110.33195495605469
747/3605	Will that do   Capitally replied	1332.721923828125
748/3605	The fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the	584.0750122070312
749/3605	The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the	110.99996185302734
750/3605	Athos called Grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the nap	197.46702575683594
751/3605	Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his	465.5659484863281
752/3605	But where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the	58.49895095825195
753/3605	What matter if you are paid for it said Athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the	68.10757446289062
754/3605	Shall I give you the change my officer said the	114.60198974609375
755/3605	No only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the nap	380.6855773925781
756/3605	The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two bottles of	270.7723388671875
757/3605	Thirtyfive minutes after seven said Athos by which you perceive I am five minutes faster than	162.13958740234375
758/3605	And bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion	95.17237854003906
759/3605	Gervais followed by Grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which Athos had taught him not even thinking of	162.67446899414062
760/3605	As long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exchange one word besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of	79.8206787109375
761/3605	But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain DArtagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an	100.69406127929688
762/3605	And now my dear Athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going   Why you see plainly enough we are going to the bast	31.29817771911621
763/3605	But what are we going to do there   You know well that we go to breakfast	31.48939323425293
764/3605	Here at least said Athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb	60.46525573730469
765/3605	It appears to me said DArtagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seash	241.56019592285156
766/3605	Where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a	72.83444213867188
767/3605	Yes said Aramis Athos is right _Animadvertuntur in desertis	4781.8134765625
768/3605	A desert would not have been amiss said Porthos but it behooved us to find	238.55374145507812
769/3605	There is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and I believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the	622.5399780273438
770/3605	Better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we cannot retreat without	997.6163940429688
771/3605	We have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which I defy anyone to divine the true	125.9103775024414
772/3605	We are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bast	89.13471984863281
773/3605	Either we shall be attacked or	160.21697998046875
774/3605	If we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor I guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the	184.9640350341797
775/3605	Moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with	1043.3585205078125
776/3605	You see that everything is to our	201.5823974609375
777/3605	Yes said DArtagnan but we shall indubitably attract a	517.2459106445312
778/3605	Well my dear replied Athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the	117.81571197509766
779/3605	But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our musk	117.90708923339844
780/3605	Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden   I dont find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an	390.19281005859375
781/3605	Well replied Athos have you not heard what DArtagnan said   What did he say demanded Porth	22.92087745666504
782/3605	DArtagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten Frenchmen were killed and as many Rochella	88.36005401611328
783/3605	What then   The bodies were not plundered were they It appears the conquerors had something else to	190.7623748779297
784/3605	Well   Well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to	225.07223510742188
785/3605	Oh Athos said Aramis truly you are a great	40.32566452026367
786/3605	Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastionsomething he had till then doubtedhe pulled his master by the skirt of his	258.2712707519531
787/3605	Where are we going asked he by a	92.08418273925781
788/3605	But said Grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins	227.8872833251953
789/3605	Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward	111.5418472290039
790/3605	Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the	154.9392547607422
791/3605	Athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to Grimauds	215.48153686523438
792/3605	Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a	188.00576782226562
793/3605	Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on	203.12167358398438
794/3605	All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the v	372.5076599121094
795/3605	Arrived at the bastion the four friends turned	126.2730484008789
796/3605	More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished	230.32290649414062
797/3605	de Busigny the dragoon the Swiss and the fourth bet	2375.66748046875
798/3605	Athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the	58.035850524902344
799/3605	All the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither Grimaud had preceded	252.9643096923828
800/3605	THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS     As Athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses French and Rochella	9019.484375
801/3605	Gentlemen said Athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while Grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges	422.91998291015625
802/3605	We can talk while performing that necessary	4933.34130859375
803/3605	These gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies cannot hear	463.8663330078125
804/3605	But we could throw them into the ditch said Porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their	114.22908782958984
805/3605	Well then cried DArtagnan pray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the	69.1385269165039
806/3605	Heaven forfend said Athos they may serve	732.0753173828125
807/3605	Judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied Ath	232.17794799804688
808/3605	How many guns gentlemen   Twelve replied Aram	226.65867614746094
809/3605	How many shots   A	139.55506896972656
810/3605	Thats quite as many as we shall	266.17529296875
811/3605	The four Musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was	126.38666534423828
812/3605	Athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to Grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sent	965.5052490234375
813/3605	Only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty Athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of	179.77793884277344
814/3605	The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks or even tail	755.4334716796875
815/3605	And now said DArtagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard I hope you are going to let me into your	35.415130615234375
816/3605	I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said Ath	123.33282470703125
817/3605	I have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmentwo classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each	418.9866027832031
818/3605	The secret is said Athos that I saw Milady last	190.34950256347656
819/3605	DArtagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of Milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the	83.67262268066406
820/3605	You saw your wi   Hush interrupted Ath	343.23004150390625
821/3605	You forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like	108.07454681396484
822/3605	Within two leagues of this place at the inn of the Red Dove	1266.098388671875
823/3605	In that case I am lost said DArtagn	15.238981246948242
824/3605	Not so bad yet replied Athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of	119.03573608398438
825/3605	But after all asked Porthos who is Milady   A charming woman said Athos sipping a glass of sparkling	74.80528259277344
826/3605	What by demanding my head of the cardinal cried DArtagnan pale with	77.86184692382812
827/3605	Yes that is true as the Gospel said Porthos I heard her with my own	84.5179214477539
828/3605	Then said DArtagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle	215.4530792236328
829/3605	I may as well blow my brains out and all will be	118.60479736328125
830/3605	Thats the last folly to be committed said Athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no	133.82998657226562
831/3605	But I can never escape said DArtagnan with such	40.713932037353516
832/3605	First my stranger of Meung then De Wardes to whom I have given three sword wounds next Milady whose secret I have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance I have balk	1605.384033203125
833/3605	Well said Athos that only makes four and we are fourone for	201.59536743164062
834/3605	_Pardieu_ if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of	93.08566284179688
835/3605	What is it Grimaud Considering the gravity of the occasion I permit you to speak my friend but be laconic I	253.0826873779297
836/3605	What do you see   A	44.308616638183594
837/3605	Of how many persons   Twenty	147.7848663330078
838/3605	What sort of men   Sixteen pioneers four	377.1670837402344
839/3605	How far distant   Five hundred p	138.75564575195312
840/3605	Good We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health DArtagn	76.33646392822266
841/3605	To your health repeated Porthos and Aram	23.90894317626953
842/3605	Well then to my health although I am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to	55.471805572509766
843/3605	Bah said Athos God is great as say the followers of Mohammed and the future is in his	358.05352783203125
844/3605	Then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him Athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the	107.64033508300781
845/3605	Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan followed his	18.90016746520996
846/3605	As to Grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their	237.1286163330078
847/3605	_Pardieu_ said Athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovel	340.58123779296875
848/3605	Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and I am convinced they would have left us in	82.64439392089844
849/3605	I doubt that replied DArtagnan for they are advancing very res	77.20098114013672
850/3605	Besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with musk	193.380615234375
851/3605	Thats because they dont see us said Ath	116.79400634765625
852/3605	My faith said Aramis I must confess I feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of	158.70567321777344
853/3605	He is a bad priest said Porthos who has pity for here	218.6765594482422
854/3605	In truth said Athos Aramis is	66.21249389648438
855/3605	What the devil are you going to do cried DArtagnan you will be	17.520275115966797
856/3605	Now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at	125.54940032958984
857/3605	Take care Athos cried DArtagnan dont you see they are aiming   Yes yes said Athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit	101.48995208740234
858/3605	In fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos but not one touched	139.09927368164062
859/3605	Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was	771.822509765625
860/3605	Grimaud said Athos still on the breach another musket   Grimaud immediately ob	169.8875274658203
861/3605	On their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the	574.7906494140625
862/3605	The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to	631.6871337890625
863/3605	Reload the muskets Grimaud said Athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our	122.25003814697266
864/3605	Where were we   I recollect you were saying said DArtagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal Milady had quit the shores of	66.69633483886719
865/3605	Whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route Milady	693.6621704101562
866/3605	With what view   With the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the Duke of	977.6007690429688
867/3605	DArtagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and	19.709280014038086
868/3605	As to that said Athos I beg you to believe that I care very little about	28.2689208984375
869/3605	Now you have done Grimaud take our brigadiers halfpike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the	302.5127258300781
870/3605	An instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four	292.8175354003906
871/3605	A thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the	606.9177856445312
872/3605	How replied DArtagnan you care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed But the duke is our	230.29270935058594
873/3605	The duke is English the duke fights against	1000.8181762695312
874/3605	Let her do what she likes with the duke I care no more about him than an empty	166.25567626953125
875/3605	And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his	105.42974853515625
876/3605	He gave us some very fine	237.24351501464844
877/3605	And moreover very handsome saddles said Porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his	97.07234954833984
878/3605	Besides said Aramis God desires the conversion and not the death of a s	306.6894836425781
879/3605	But this creature must be a demon said Porthos holding out his plate to Aramis who was cutting up a f	86.67936706542969
880/3605	And this _carte blanche_ said DArtagnan this _carte blanche_ does it remain in her hands   No it passed into mine I will not say without trouble for if I did I should tell a	254.4278106689453
881/3605	My dear Athos I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my	58.795265197753906
882/3605	Then it was to go to her that you left us said Aram	68.5294418334961
883/3605	And you have that letter of the cardinal said DArtagn	32.78538513183594
884/3605	Here it is said Athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his	124.74349212646484
885/3605	DArtagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read  	85.50159454345703
886/3605	3 1627     It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	84.87152862548828
887/3605	RICHELIEU     In fact said Aramis it is an absolution according to	892.2105712890625
888/3605	That paper must be torn to pieces said DArtagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of	82.30794525146484
889/3605	On the contrary said Athos it must be preserved	119.21846771240234
890/3605	I would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold	96.89019775390625
891/3605	And what will she do now asked the young	64.607666015625
892/3605	The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest DArtagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the Bast	109.11890411376953
893/3605	Go to It appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said Porth	175.39772033691406
894/3605	I say I am entirely of Porthoss opinion replied Aram	59.199554443359375
895/3605	Fortunately she is far off said Porthos for I confess she would worry me if she were	85.9508285522461
896/3605	She worries me in England as well as in France said Ath	117.27332305908203
897/3605	But when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said Porth	107.35301971435547
898/3605	It is only the dead who do not	131.0829315185547
899/3605	You think so Porthos replied the Musketeer with a sad smile which DArtagnan alone	40.186729431152344
900/3605	The young men sprang up and seized their musk	57.94335174560547
901/3605	This time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the	405.4222412109375
902/3605	Shall we return to the camp said Porth	62.22980499267578
903/3605	I dont think the sides are	1374.685546875
904/3605	The first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the	157.8873748779297
905/3605	Well then said Aramis we must form a plan of	66.27737426757812
906/3605	As soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon	230.820068359375
907/3605	If they continue to advance we must fire	362.1732482910156
908/3605	We must fire as long as we have loaded	440.97589111328125
909/3605	If those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a	576.2590942382812
910/3605	Decidedly Athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside	105.95307159423828
911/3605	Gentlemen said Athos no divided attention I beg let each one pick out his	1249.1658935546875
912/3605	The four muskets made but one report but four men	220.909423828125
913/3605	The drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging	2189.767578125
914/3605	Then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same	785.9415893554688
915/3605	Nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the Rochellais continued to advance in quick	391.9053039550781
916/3605	With every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slack	378.580810546875
917/3605	Arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the	45.902549743652344
918/3605	A last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the	328.7881164550781
919/3605	Now my friends said Athos finish them at a	144.15335083007812
920/3605	Then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over   Can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said Ath	131.601318359375
921/3605	My faith it appears so said DArtagn	33.65447998046875
922/3605	No cried Porthos there go three or four limping	310.3040466308594
923/3605	In fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the	216.2891082763672
924/3605	These were all who were left of the little	158.4705810546875
925/3605	Gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair	262.77935791015625
926/3605	Besides DArtagnan has not told us his idea	65.47087097167969
927/3605	And the Musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the	338.5338439941406
928/3605	Yes you said you had an idea said Ath	83.50963592529297
929/3605	Well I will go to England a second time I will go and find	68.95639038085938
930/3605	You shall not do that DArtagnan said Athos co	23.67412567138672
931/3605	And why not Have I not been there once   Yes but at that period we were not at	77.48802185058594
932/3605	At that period Buckingham was an ally and not an	320.0189208984375
933/3605	What you would now do amounts to	954.729248046875
934/3605	DArtagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was	32.269893646240234
935/3605	But said Porthos I think I have an idea in my	18.138978958129883
936/3605	Silence for Monsieur Porthoss idea said Aram	42.5140266418457
937/3605	I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent I am not very clever at pretext	114.67266082763672
938/3605	Milady does not know me I will get access to her without her suspecting me and when I catch my beauty I will strangle	132.95013427734375
939/3605	Well replied Athos I am not far from approving the idea of Monsieur Porth	46.90581512451172
940/3605	Kill a woman No listen to me I have the true	314.1368713378906
941/3605	Let us see your idea Aramis said Athos who felt much deference for the young Musket	125.00763702392578
942/3605	Ah my faith yes said Porthos and DArtagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it	36.76317596435547
943/3605	As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty said Aramis coloring I will take that upon	350.05035400390625
944/3605	I know a clever person at Tours   Aramis stopped on seeing Athos	159.47763061523438
945/3605	Well do you not adopt this means Athos said DArtagn	23.19582176208496
946/3605	Without reckoning objected Porthos that the queen would save Monsieur de Buckingham but would take no heed of	128.0612335205078
947/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan what Porthos says is full of	80.33169555664062
948/3605	Ah ah but whats going on in the city yonder said Ath	155.64300537109375
949/3605	The four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached	313.1323547363281
950/3605	You see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said Ath	62.18415451049805
951/3605	You dont think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said Porth	81.18789672851562
952/3605	I feel myself quite in a humor for it and I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of	118.6014633178711
953/3605	Upon my word the drum draws near said DArtagn	183.80262756347656
954/3605	It is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hours journey from the city to	162.43565368652344
955/3605	That is more than time enough for us to devise a	120.5698471069336
956/3605	If we go from this place we shall never find another so	142.1033172607422
957/3605	Ah stop I have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to	164.97366333007812
958/3605	Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable	1190.4117431640625
959/3605	Athos made a sign for his lackey to	92.75517272949219
960/3605	Grimaud said Athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their	116.95127868652344
961/3605	And do you comprehend Grimaud said Aram	60.895999908447266
962/3605	Grimaud made a sign in the	88.302734375
963/3605	Thats all that is necessary said Athos now for my	137.46173095703125
964/3605	I should like however to comprehend said Porth	81.8941879272461
965/3605	Yes yes Athoss idea cried Aramis and DArtagnan at the same	25.52680778503418
966/3605	This Milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as I think you told me DArtagnan   Yes I know him very well and I also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sisterin	49.048919677734375
967/3605	If he detested her it would be all the better replied Ath	49.98440170288086
968/3605	In that case we are as well off as we	117.1573486328125
969/3605	And yet said Porthos I would like to know what Grimaud is	36.477413177490234
970/3605	What is her brotherinlaws name   Lord de	50.46800231933594
971/3605	Where is he now   He returned to London at the first sound of	42.51768493652344
972/3605	Well theres just the man we want said Ath	156.17672729492188
973/3605	It is he whom we must	169.48191833496094
974/3605	We will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of	94.26496887207031
975/3605	There is in London I hope some establishment like that of the Magdalens or of the Repentant D	872.8350830078125
976/3605	He must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in	131.3288116455078
977/3605	Yes said DArtagnan till she comes	23.013347625732422
978/3605	Ah my faith said Athos you require too much DArtagn	52.02079391479492
979/3605	I have given you all I have and I beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my	55.878387451171875
980/3605	But I think it would be still better said Aramis to inform the queen and Lord de Winter at the same	26.905012130737305
981/3605	Yes but who is to carry the letter to Tours and who to London   I answer for Bazin said Aram	75.56755065917969
982/3605	Ay said Porthos if we cannot leave the camp our lackeys	68.22586059570312
983/3605	To be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said Aram	144.00735473632812
984/3605	Give the lackeys money and they will	240.26669311523438
985/3605	We will give them money replied Ath	70.29718780517578
986/3605	Have you any money   The four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so	84.2692642211914
987/3605	Look out cried DArtagnan I see black points and red points moving y	392.7557678222656
988/3605	Why did you talk of a regiment Athos It is a veritable army   My faith yes said Athos there they	73.67057800292969
989/3605	See the sneaks come without drum or	11512.6748046875
990/3605	Ah ah have you finished Grimaud   Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque	58.5139045715332
991/3605	Some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in	690.3107299804688
992/3605	Bravo said Athos that does honor to your	268.43939208984375
993/3605	All very well said Porthos but I should like to	22.858898162841797
994/3605	Let us decamp first and you will understand	702.0985107421875
995/3605	A moment gentlemen a moment give Grimaud time to clear away the	690.9789428710938
996/3605	Ah ah said Aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarg	556.5305786132812
997/3605	I am of DArtagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our	64.1208724975586
998/3605	My faith said Athos I have nothing to say against a	55.64689636230469
999/3605	We bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a	203.52130126953125
1000/3605	Nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off   Grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the	154.8681182861328
1001/3605	The four friends followed ten paces behind	203.05599975585938
1002/3605	What the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried Ath	56.5444450378418
1003/3605	The white flag _morbleu_ We must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a nap	225.825927734375
1004/3605	And Athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures	390.3267822265625
1005/3605	But Athos might be said to bear a charmed	86.58052062988281
1006/3605	The balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck	233.42611694335938
1007/3605	Athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the	151.97325134277344
1008/3605	On both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries of	651.7579956054688
1009/3605	A second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a	636.4485473632812
1010/3605	Cries were heard from the camp Come down come down   Athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with	157.00576782226562
1011/3605	Come along Athos come along cried DArtagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be	117.36328125
1012/3605	But Athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by	1053.3939208984375
1013/3605	Grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the	361.0960388183594
1014/3605	At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusill	77.8387222290039
1015/3605	Whats that asked Porthos what are they firing at now I hear no balls whistle and I see nobody   They are firing at the corpses replied Ath	335.3427429199219
1016/3605	But the dead cannot return their	815.7553100585938
1017/3605	Certainly not They will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their	190.8659210205078
1018/3605	That renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much	1240.9676513671875
1019/3605	Oh I comprehend now said the astonished Porth	84.49370574951172
1020/3605	Thats lucky said Athos shrugging his	45.49785232543945
1021/3605	On their part the French on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of	289.65338134765625
1022/3605	At length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their	196.99668884277344
1023/3605	The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the bast	81.6802749633789
1024/3605	These Rochellais are bungling fellows said Athos how many have we killed of thema dozen   Or	816.9569702148438
1025/3605	How many did we crush under the wall   Eight or	427.5587463378906
1026/3605	And in exchange for all that not even a scratch Ah but what is the matter with your hand DArtagnan It bleeds	182.3459014892578
1027/3605	A spent ball   Not even	419.5525817871094
1028/3605	What is it then   We have said that Athos loved DArtagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young	94.18531799316406
1029/3605	Only grazed a little replied DArtagnan my fingers were caught between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin was	365.3896484375
1030/3605	That comes of wearing diamonds my master said Athos disdain	348.8595886230469
1031/3605	Ah to be sure cried Porthos there is a	27.273298263549805
1032/3605	Why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond   Stop a bit said Aram	161.42214965820312
1033/3605	Well thought of Porthos this time you have an	56.659610748291016
1034/3605	Undoubtedly said Porthos drawing himself up at Athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell	100.7596664428711
1035/3605	But said DArtagnan it is the queens	26.766979217529297
1036/3605	The stronger reason why it should be sold replied Ath	134.61831665039062
1037/3605	The queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham her lover nothing more	301.2043762207031
1038/3605	The queen saving us her friends nothing more	3039.1259765625
1039/3605	What says Monsieur the Abbé I dont ask Porthos his opinion has been	50.40404510498047
1040/3605	Why I think said Aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token DArtagnan may sell	179.17630004882812
1041/3605	My dear Aramis you speak like theology person	2583.96044921875
1042/3605	Your advice then is   To sell the diamond replied Aram	96.29612731933594
1043/3605	Well then said DArtagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about	43.11656188964844
1044/3605	The fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consci	487.67193603515625
1045/3605	My faith it was time that idea came into Porthoss	171.5020294189453
1046/3605	Here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this	154.09576416015625
1047/3605	We are observed they are coming to meet	163.3480682373047
1048/3605	In fact as we have said the whole camp was in	187.02667236328125
1049/3605	More than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friendsan undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real	557.4003295898438
1050/3605	Nothing was heard but cries of Live the Musketeers Live the Guards	3055.99169921875
1051/3605	de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was	113.57818603515625
1052/3605	The dragoon and the Swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the	142.11233520507812
1053/3605	There was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochella	657.3019409179688
1054/3605	The tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent La Houdinière his captain of the Guards to inquire what was going	377.5649108886719
1055/3605	The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of	838.90673828125
1056/3605	Well asked the cardinal on seeing La Houdinière	545.6314697265625
1057/3605	Well monseigneur replied the latter three Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion	140.57760620117188
1058/3605	Gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed I dont know how many Rochella	139.60214233398438
1059/3605	Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers   Yes monseign	27.82937240600586
1060/3605	What are their names   Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aram	37.84569549560547
1061/3605	Still my three brave fellows murmured the	350.9105224609375
1062/3605	Positively these four men must be on my	143.68614196777344
1063/3605	The same evening the cardinal spoke to	159.02853393554688
1064/3605	de Tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole	135.11465454101562
1065/3605	de Tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his Eminence not forgetting the episode of the nap	146.7549591064453
1066/3605	Thats well Monsieur de Tréville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to	79.75820922851562
1067/3605	I will have three _fleurdelis_ embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a	596.13818359375
1068/3605	de Tréville that will be unjust to the Guards	564.1412963867188
1069/3605	Monsieur dArtagnan is not with me he serves under Monsieur Dessess	186.39642333984375
1070/3605	Well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same	72.04898071289062
1071/3605	de Tréville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and DArtagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next	86.19224548339844
1072/3605	We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musket	49.7884407043457
1073/3605	The three friends were likewise greatly	1406.8182373046875
1074/3605	My faith said DArtagnan to Athos you had a triumphant idea As you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest	150.08221435546875
1075/3605	Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of God we shall henceforth pass for cardinal	450.0972900390625
1076/3605	That evening DArtagnan went to present his respects to	46.08441925048828
1077/3605	Dessessart and inform him of his	580.9884033203125
1078/3605	Dessessart who esteemed DArtagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for	1570.6844482421875
1079/3605	DArtagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into	117.30620574951172
1080/3605	Dessessarts valet came to DArtagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand liv	159.14930725097656
1081/3605	This was the price of the queens	82.85218048095703
1082/3605	A FAMILY AFFAIR     Athos had invented the phrase family	5781.25146484375
1083/3605	A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family affair concerned	484.1127014160156
1084/3605	People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the	262.1835021972656
1085/3605	Therefore Athos had invented the phrase _family affair	1652.9075927734375
1086/3605	Aramis had discovered the idea _the lackeys	306.90777587890625
1087/3605	Porthos had discovered the means _the diamond	258.7731018066406
1088/3605	DArtagnan alone had discovered nothinghe ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed	199.14715576171875
1089/3605	Ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his	354.23321533203125
1090/3605	de Trévilles was as gay and cheerful as	624.7852783203125
1091/3605	DArtagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as Aramis and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete	442.6819763183594
1092/3605	DArtagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the	72.25275421142578
1093/3605	After breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at Athoss lodging and there finish their	124.53881072998047
1094/3605	DArtagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeers uniform in every street of the	187.94302368164062
1095/3605	In the evening at the appointed hour the four friends	63.6331672668457
1096/3605	There only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to Miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at Tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the	354.5678405761719
1097/3605	Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his	458.9652404785156
1098/3605	Porthos boasted of the strength of Mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary	162.1667938232422
1099/3605	Aramis confiding in the address of Bazin made a pompous eulogium on his	234.36776733398438
1100/3605	Finally DArtagnan had entire faith in the bravery of Planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulog	124.26321411132812
1101/3605	These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too	437.170654296875
1102/3605	Unfortunately said Athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities	633.7269897460938
1103/3605	But where is such a lackey to be found   Not to be found cried Ath	46.59538269042969
1104/3605	I know it well so take Grim	159.9908447265625
1105/3605	Planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the	130.32369995117188
1106/3605	Gentlemen said Aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the	271.84881591796875
1107/3605	What Aramis says is very sensible replied Athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their	245.388916015625
1108/3605	Monsieur Abbé you are a great moral	73.42207336425781
1109/3605	Doubtless said Aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys   Speak lower Aramis said Ath	166.22451782226562
1110/3605	Thats wisenot for the lackeys resumed Aramis but for the masterfor the _masters_ we may	640.1388549804688
1111/3605	Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us	125.10441589355469
1112/3605	Well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him	217.1449737548828
1113/3605	Why good God you will be deceived just the same said Athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in	517.93798828125
1114/3605	They will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from	208.6619415283203
1115/3605	Once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess	928.4349975585938
1116/3605	What the devil we are not	142.8636474609375
1117/3605	To reach EnglandAthos lowered his voiceall France covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be	1134.4266357421875
1118/3605	A passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with English in order to ask the way to	174.0406494140625
1119/3605	Really I think the thing very	190.74363708496094
1120/3605	Not at all cried DArtagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary I think it very	47.58339309692383
1121/3605	It would be no doubt _parbleu_ if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal   Speak lower said Ath	103.29918670654297
1122/3605	of intrigues and secrets of state continued DArtagnan complying with the	333.669677734375
1123/3605	I will write to him then nearly in these	179.1397247314453
1124/3605	Let us see said Athos assuming in advance a critical	303.1167297363281
1125/3605	_Monsieur and dear friend_   Ah yes _Dear friend_ to an Englishman interrupted Athos well commenced Bravo DArtagnan Only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the	384.6773681640625
1126/3605	I will say then _Monsieur_ quite	170.41627502441406
1127/3605	You may even say _My Lord_ replied Athos who stickled for propri	588.201171875
1128/3605	_My Lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg_   Good _the Luxembourg_ One might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother Thats ingenious said Ath	613.4813842773438
1129/3605	Well then we will put simply _My Lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared_   My dear DArtagnan you will never make anything but a very bad	170.96591186523438
1130/3605	_Where your life was spared_ For shame thats	15100.904296875
1131/3605	A man of spirit is not to be reminded of such	190.0131378173828
1132/3605	A benefit reproached is an offense	38437.7421875
1133/3605	The devil said DArtagnan you are insupport	30.69227409362793
1134/3605	If the letter must be written under your censure my faith I renounce the	724.9616088867188
1135/3605	Handle the musket and the sword my dear	195.31793212890625
1136/3605	You will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to Monsieur Abb	157.4463653564453
1137/3605	Ay ay said Porthos pass the pen to Aramis who writes theses in	360.62164306640625
1138/3605	Draw up this note for us Aramis but by our Holy Father the Pope cut it short for I shall prune you in my turn I warn	209.93370056152344
1139/3605	I ask no better said Aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the	114.85916137695312
1140/3605	I have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a h	432.5613098144531
1141/3605	I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the	131.65264892578125
1142/3605	But continued Aramis the details escape	669.8698120117188
1143/3605	DArtagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in	14.081202507019043
1144/3605	At length Athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to DArtagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to	66.496337890625
1145/3605	Because she had been branded continued DArtagn	237.97329711914062
1146/3605	Impossible What do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed  	115.79772186279297
1147/3605	And her husband found out that she had a _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder cried Porth	338.7923583984375
1148/3605	These three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos each with a sadder inton	225.24037170410156
1149/3605	And who has seen this _fleurdelis_ inquired Aram	1379.7685546875
1150/3605	Or rather to observe the chronological order I and DArtagnan replied Ath	304.2521667480469
1151/3605	And does the husband of this frightful creature still live said Aram	141.48426818847656
1152/3605	Are you quite sure of it   I am	17.60647201538086
1153/3605	There was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his	147.3839569091797
1154/3605	This time said Athos first breaking the silence DArtagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at	187.20941162109375
1155/3605	The devil You are right Athos said Aramis and it is a rather difficult	61.482200622558594
1156/3605	The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very	715.9008178710938
1157/3605	Never mind Be silent I will	1512.4210205078125
1158/3605	As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important	279.6161193847656
1159/3605	Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in	247.0060272216797
1160/3605	But the third time which is the present you may	615.7676391601562
1161/3605	Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the	279.0195617675781
1162/3605	Watch her arrival for she has great and terrible	369.46307373046875
1163/3605	If you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left	466.8529052734375
1164/3605	Well now that will do wonderfully well said Ath	229.1142578125
1165/3605	My dear Aramis you have the pen of a secretary of	145.17198181152344
1166/3605	Lord de Winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be	95.40665435791016
1167/3605	I have the price and DArtagnan threw the bag upon the	46.14464569091797
1168/3605	At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes and Porthos	44.40264129638672
1169/3605	How much in that little bag   Seven thousand livres in louis of twelve franc	227.61285400390625
1170/3605	That poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres   It appears so said Athos since here they	92.4362564086914
1171/3605	I dont suppose that our friend DArtagnan has added any of his own to the	44.03551483154297
1172/3605	But gentlemen in all this said DArtagnan we do not think of the	23.527687072753906
1173/3605	Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear	541.52734375
1174/3605	That is the least we owe	134.82554626464844
1175/3605	Thats true said Athos but that concerns Aram	141.6287841796875
1176/3605	Well replied the latter blushing what must I say   Oh thats simple enough replied Ath	61.917301177978516
1177/3605	Write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at	578.60107421875
1178/3605	Aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his	89.95606994628906
1179/3605	This clever person is your relative then   Cousing	3331.96875
1180/3605	It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even arrive in sight of the	221.719482421875
1181/3605	I will even venture to say that I am certain	52.7723503112793
1182/3605	de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great	227.80189514160156
1183/3605	His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to	754.720947265625
1184/3605	He would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded	166.83230590820312
1185/3605	Give these happy tidings to your sister my dear	487.488037109375
1186/3605	I have dreamed that the unlucky Englishman was	139.80398559570312
1187/3605	I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this I am sure I have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive	143.4691162109375
1188/3605	Be assured then of seeing me soon	798.8629150390625
1189/3605	Capital cried Athos you are the king of poets my dear Aram	101.77651977539062
1190/3605	You speak like the Apocalypse and you are as true as the	299.1443786621094
1191/3605	There is nothing now to do but to put the address to this	89.7126693725586
1192/3605	He folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote   _To Ml	300.8847961425781
1193/3605	The three friends looked at one another and laughed they were	145.66970825195312
1194/3605	Now said Aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that Bazin alone can carry this letter to	185.33865356445312
1195/3605	My cousin knows nobody but Bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would	1378.8404541015625
1196/3605	Besides Bazin is ambitious and learned Bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept	2524.127197265625
1197/3605	Well as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn or at least a	173.78729248046875
1198/3605	You can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than	268.17059326171875
1199/3605	Very well said DArtagnan I consent to Bazin with all my heart but grant me Planc	52.26478576660156
1200/3605	Milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his	611.5125732421875
1201/3605	Now Planchet has an excellent memory and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to	137.38369750976562
1202/3605	If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements Aramis those of London are	1168.39404296875
1203/3605	I request then that Planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to London with me and knows how to speak correctly _London sir if you please and my master Lord DArtagnan	217.6663055419922
1204/3605	With that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and	202.73085021972656
1205/3605	In that case said Athos Planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and Bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand liv	106.78773498535156
1206/3605	We will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common	158.39549255371094
1207/3605	Will that do   My dear Athos said Aramis you speak like Nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the	129.43406677246094
1208/3605	Well then said Athos it is	49.35499572753906
1209/3605	Everything considered I am not sorry to retain Grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and I am	101.57942199707031
1210/3605	Yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him	388.2037048339844
1211/3605	Planchet was sent for and instructions were given	216.02503967285156
1212/3605	The matter had been named to him by DArtagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the	63.911014556884766
1213/3605	I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said Planchet and if I am taken I will swallow	131.5052032470703
1214/3605	Well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said DArtagn	26.213516235351562
1215/3605	You will give me a copy this evening which I shall know by heart	142.3794403076172
1216/3605	DArtagnan looked at his friends as if to say Well what did I tell you   Now continued he addressing Planchet you have eight days to get an interview with Lord de Winter you have eight days to returnin all sixteen	60.803733825683594
1217/3605	If on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past	94.17489624023438
1218/3605	Then monsieur said Planchet you must buy me a	23.904672622680664
1219/3605	Take this said Athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good	197.39132690429688
1220/3605	Remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your masters head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for	420.8268737792969
1221/3605	But remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to DArtagnan I will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your	236.54678344726562
1222/3605	Oh monsieur said Planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the Musket	68.02906036376953
1223/3605	And I said Porthos rolling his large eyes remember I will skin you	366.0172424316406
1224/3605	Ah monsieur   And I said Aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that I will roast you at a slow fire like a	103.67080688476562
1225/3605	Ah monsieur   Planchet began to	15.730576515197754
1226/3605	We will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely	291.0973815917969
1227/3605	See Planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like	133.7520294189453
1228/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet I will succeed or I will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will	77.59425354003906
1229/3605	It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by	53.19102096557617
1230/3605	He gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight oclock in the	81.0948486328125
1231/3605	In the morning as he was mounting his horse DArtagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took Planchet	82.70136260986328
1232/3605	When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it you will further say to him _Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham for they wish to assassinate him	488.2799377441406
1233/3605	But this Planchet is so serious and important that I have not informed my friends that I would entrust this secret to you and for a captains commission I would not write	118.33352661132812
1234/3605	Be satisfied monsieur said Planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in	49.25343322753906
1235/3605	Bazin set out the next day for Tours and was allowed eight days for performing his	478.43634033203125
1236/3605	The four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the h	188.41033935546875
1237/3605	Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who	130.88999938964844
1238/3605	More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected	730.978271484375
1239/3605	They had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety Milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very	355.9039611816406
1240/3605	The four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was	337.08526611328125
1241/3605	It is true however that it was the shorter and easier	498.22601318359375
1242/3605	Aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orth	115.25225830078125
1243/3605	Good God cried he laughing I quite despair of my poor Michon she will never write like Monsieur de Vo	128.11932373046875
1244/3605	What does you mean by boor Michon said the Swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter	163.55001831054688
1245/3605	Oh _pardieu_ less than nothing said Aramis a charming little seamstress whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few lines as a sort of keeps	439.1976318359375
1246/3605	The duvil said the Swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade   Aramis read the letter and passed it to Ath	217.58370971679688
1247/3605	See what she writes to me Athos said	112.6030044555664
1248/3605	Adieu Take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken	164.78395080566406
1249/3605	MARIE MICHON     And what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the	1249.938720703125
1250/3605	Yez whats the dream said the	1383.42822265625
1251/3605	Well _pardieu_ said Aramis it was only this I had a dream and I related it to	45.7889404296875
1252/3605	Yez yez said the Swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but I neffer	10243.98046875
1253/3605	You are very fortunate said Athos rising I wish I could say as much   Neffer replied the Swiss enchanted that a man like Athos could envy him	164.87608337402344
1254/3605	Neffer neffer   DArtagnan seeing Athos rise did likewise took his arm and went	166.91091918945312
1255/3605	Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the	58.43730926513672
1256/3605	As to Bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the Swiss he dreamed that Aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals	86.29834747314453
1257/3605	But as we have said Bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four	77.73108673095703
1258/3605	The days of expectation are long and DArtagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour	368.9693908691406
1259/3605	He forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of Mil	503.9436950683594
1260/3605	He credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that Planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his	186.81507873535156
1261/3605	Still further his confidence in the worthy Picard at one time so great diminished day by	1795.4560546875
1262/3605	This anxiety became so great that it even extended to Aramis and Porth	60.34387969970703
1263/3605	Athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary	276.1324462890625
1264/3605	On the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in DArtagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was	133.31204223632812
1265/3605	Really said Athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so And what does it amount to after all To be	203.0755615234375
1266/3605	Well but we should be taken out of prison Madame Bonacieux was	126.14744567871094
1267/3605	Wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest Planchet will be	116.01896667480469
1268/3605	He promised to be here and I have very great faith in Planchet who appears to me to be a very good	52.93927764892578
1269/3605	But if he does not come said DArtagn	13.42541217803955
1270/3605	Well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed thats	79.51055908203125
1271/3605	He may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarr	234.36172485351562
1272/3605	Eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a	1966.2205810546875
1273/3605	Be philosophers as I am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us	110.41427612304688
1274/3605	Nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambert	700.1561279296875
1275/3605	Thats all very well replied DArtagnan but I am tired of fearing when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of Mil	86.22459411621094
1276/3605	You are very fastidious said Athos such a beautiful woman   A woman of mark said Porthos with his loud	42.22964096069336
1277/3605	Athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not rep	91.55069732666016
1278/3605	The day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it	416.05621337890625
1279/3605	Athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the Parpaill	490.43157958984375
1280/3605	de Busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his	629.3642578125
1281/3605	They were playing together as usual when seven oclock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the	277.5832824707031
1282/3605	At half past seven the retreat was	1108.3040771484375
1283/3605	We are lost said DArtagnan in the ear of Ath	21.076324462890625
1284/3605	You mean to say we _have lost_ said Athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the	115.17491149902344
1285/3605	Come gentlemen said he they are beating the	1008.587890625
1286/3605	Let us to bed   And Athos went out of the Parpaillot followed by DArtagn	51.63621139526367
1287/3605	Aramis came behind giving his arm to Porth	84.06040954589844
1288/3605	Aramis mumbled verses to himself and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of	264.43670654296875
1289/3605	But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to DArtagnan and a wellknown voice said Monsieur I have brought your cloak it is chilly this	70.60759735107422
1290/3605	Planchet cried DArtagnan beside himself with	32.41151809692383
1291/3605	Well yes Planchet to be sure said Athos what is there so astonishing in that He promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is	114.1473617553711
1292/3605	Bravo Planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master I will promise you a place in my	75.58409881591797
1293/3605	Oh no never said Planchet I will never leave Monsieur dArtagn	19.795610427856445
1294/3605	At the same time DArtagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his	28.73755645751953
1295/3605	DArtagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passersby and he restrained	122.1466064453125
1296/3605	I have the note said he to Athos and to his	50.726776123046875
1297/3605	Thats well said Athos let us go home and read	70.44526672363281
1298/3605	The note burned the hand of DArtagn	45.06496047973633
1299/3605	He wished to hasten their steps but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his	57.21965026855469
1300/3605	At length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised DArtagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected	102.93876647949219
1301/3605	It contained half a line in a hand perfectly British and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan   _Thank you be easy	1757.990478515625
1302/3605	Athos took the letter from the hands of DArtagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a c	80.93502807617188
1303/3605	Then calling Planchet he said Now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as	138.54832458496094
1304/3605	I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said Planc	205.5519561767578
1305/3605	Well cried DArtagnan tell us all about	20.60749053955078
1306/3605	You are right Planchet said Athos besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the	222.36309814453125
1307/3605	Go to bed Planchet and sleep sound	220.59469604492188
1308/3605	My faith monsieur that will be the first time I have done so for sixteen	40.207794189453125
1309/3605	Well if you will have the truth and me too said Ath	76.5372543334961
1310/3605	But the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept	2902.2880859375
1311/3605	Nine days after leaving the Charente pale with fatigue and vexation Milady saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre	1176.640869140625
1312/3605	She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three	82.66291809082031
1313/3605	Add another day for landing and that would make	234.1183624267578
1314/3605	Add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in	860.894287109375
1315/3605	She reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against	224.14315795898438
1316/3605	She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of	618.8516235351562
1317/3605	Milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France the messenger of his Eminence entered the port in	443.8821716308594
1318/3605	All the city was agitated by an extraordinary	557.1524047851562
1319/3605	Four large vessels recently built had just been	3485.478515625
1320/3605	It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England remembers that there is a	419.3815612792969
1321/3605	They entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the	525.2327880859375
1322/3605	This boat contained an officer a mate and eight row	2025.8482666015625
1323/3605	The officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the	109.43946838378906
1324/3605	The officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon	250.22006225585938
1325/3605	When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without	915.6524047851562
1326/3605	Then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to Milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to	145.3411865234375
1327/3605	He then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed	197.03717041015625
1328/3605	Then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six	945.954345703125
1329/3605	The boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous	390.56732177734375
1330/3605	During the examination of Milady by the officer as may well be imagined Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her	246.234375
1331/3605	But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her	244.38096618652344
1332/3605	The officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twentyfive or twentysix years of	42.185081481933594
1333/3605	When they entered the port it was already	228.64768981933594
1334/3605	The fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become	635.923095703125
1335/3605	The air they breathed was heavy damp and	3584.35498046875
1336/3605	Milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of	333.8697509765625
1337/3605	The officer desired to have Miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the	329.1010437011719
1338/3605	When this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his	370.925537109375
1339/3605	Milady looked at this man and	219.49832153320312
1340/3605	Who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account   You may perceive madame by my uniform that I am an officer in the English navy replied the young	84.84320831298828
1341/3605	These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calm	67.35102081298828
1342/3605	Nevertheless they had not the power of convincing Mil	210.14212036132812
1343/3605	But I am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester my name is Lady Clarik and this measure   This measure is general madame and you will seek in vain to evade	533.4257202148438
1344/3605	Accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat	79.11896514892578
1345/3605	A large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside	193.08200073242188
1346/3605	The eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the	123.06687927246094
1347/3605	In five minutes they gained the	142.3068084716797
1348/3605	The officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to Mil	107.80613708496094
1349/3605	Is this carriage for us asked Mil	626.4755249023438
1350/3605	The hôtel then is far away   At the other end of the	68.93350982666016
1351/3605	Very well said Milady and she resolutely entered the	363.80010986328125
1352/3605	The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside Milady and shut the	250.74415588378906
1353/3605	Immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the	174.6920928955078
1354/3605	At the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being	55.77882385253906
1355/3605	Houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one	353.65130615234375
1356/3605	But we are no longer in the city sir said	50.53091049194336
1357/3605	I beg you to understand sir I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking	45.64460372924805
1358/3605	Oh this is too much cried Mil	219.74766540527344
1359/3605	Help help   No voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a	294.00958251953125
1360/3605	Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the	172.11573791503906
1361/3605	Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself	68.73479461669922
1362/3605	Take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in	90.08802795410156
1363/3605	The officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost	319.8235168457031
1364/3605	Then you dont know me sir   It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing	18.212413787841797
1365/3605	And on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me   None I swear to	39.179691314697266
1366/3605	There was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that Milady felt	193.7411346435547
1367/3605	At length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and	328.15594482421875
1368/3605	Then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel Milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep	717.5337524414062
1369/3605	The carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and	588.2446899414062
1370/3605	Almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to Milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calm	57.95446014404297
1371/3605	Still then I am a prisoner said Milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but I feel assured it will not be for long added	104.13023376464844
1372/3605	My own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of	377.75006103515625
1373/3605	However flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different mod	742.620849609375
1374/3605	Immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach	789.6319580078125
1375/3605	Then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the	131.0358123779297
1376/3605	She with a stillsmiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of	219.08193969726562
1377/3605	They then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for Mil	169.89085388183594
1378/3605	With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest	171.08743286132812
1379/3605	It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the	482.7950134277344
1380/3605	In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate	251.47409057617188
1381/3605	But no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without	557.1483764648438
1382/3605	The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness Milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his	167.2321319580078
1383/3605	It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become	443.3539733886719
1384/3605	At length Milady could hold out no longer she broke the	500.2637939453125
1385/3605	In the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing Put an end to my doubts I have courage enough for any danger I can foresee for every misfortune which I	197.44320678710938
1386/3605	Where am I and why am I here If I am free why these bars and these doors If I am a prisoner what crime have I committed   You are here in the apartment destined for you mad	146.60450744628906
1387/3605	I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this	72.27225494384766
1388/3605	This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a	105.50237274169922
1389/3605	There terminates at least to the present moment the duty I had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another	508.19219970703125
1390/3605	And who is that other person asked Milady warm	691.9984741210938
1391/3605	Can you not tell me his name   At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the	60.301856994628906
1392/3605	Some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the	161.2475128173828
1393/3605	That person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of	104.13980865478516
1394/3605	At the same time the door opened a man appeared on the	32.403228759765625
1395/3605	He was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his	92.63172149658203
1396/3605	Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a	119.87104034423828
1397/3605	The stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp Milady involuntarily drew	296.0151672363281
1398/3605	Then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor What my brother is it you   Yes fair lady replied Lord de Winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is I	107.9918212890625
1399/3605	But this castle then   Is	237.0269775390625
1400/3605	I am then your prisoner   Nearly	111.7856674194336
1401/3605	But this is a frightful abuse of power   No highsounding words Let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to	944.9822998046875
1402/3605	Then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he	44.41156768798828
1403/3605	All is well I thank you now leave us alone	759.943115234375
1404/3605	She knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrig	468.7920837402344
1405/3605	She rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been	362.0548400878906
1406/3605	This supposition appeared to her most	255.6934356689453
1407/3605	It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the	99.6054458618164
1408/3605	At all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent	191.11163330078125
1409/3605	Yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future	184.48770141601562
1410/3605	You have then decided to come to England again said Lord de Winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to set your feet on British ground   Milady replied to this question by another	236.23849487304688
1411/3605	Ah to see me said de Winter cunning	339.7327575683594
1412/3605	What is there astonishing in that   And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me  	55.7519416809082
1413/3605	So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the Channel   For you	78.45592498779297
1414/3605	The deuce What tenderness my sister   But am I not your nearest relative demanded Milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuous	254.38900756835938
1415/3605	And my only heir are you not said Lord de Winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of Mil	51.28158187866211
1416/3605	Whatever command she had over herself Milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape	129.88551330566406
1417/3605	In fact the blow was direct and	377.37432861328125
1418/3605	The first idea that occurred to Miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her	199.76898193359375
1419/3605	She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon DArtagnan when he spared the life of her	83.08448791503906
1420/3605	I do not understand my Lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak	112.75688171386719
1421/3605	What do you mean to say Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words   Oh my God no said Lord de Winter with apparent good	99.10855102539062
1422/3605	You wish to see me and you come to	48.83673858642578
1423/3605	What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me   No what I think astonishing is that you should expect my	76.85711669921875
1424/3605	And yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear	42.546878814697266
1425/3605	Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers I am commandant of the	297.7255859375
1426/3605	My heart told me what your mouth has just confirmedthat is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this momentand I sent my cutter to meet	364.4983215332031
1427/3605	Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied and she was the more	413.2132873535156
1428/3605	My brother continued she was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived  	178.25082397460938
1429/3605	Ah I can understand how the sight of him struck you replied Lord de	82.25357055664062
1430/3605	You came from a country where he must be very much talked of and I know that his armaments against France greatly engage the attention of your friend the	204.2373046875
1431/3605	My friend the cardinal cried Milady seeing that on this point as on the other Lord de Winter seemed well	261.5234680175781
1432/3605	Is he not your friend replied the baron neglig	101.82825469970703
1433/3605	Ah pardon I thought so but we will return to my Lord Duke	368.5408935546875
1434/3605	Let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had	1615.36572265625
1435/3605	You came you say to see me  	38.960655212402344
1436/3605	Well I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every	45.44681167602539
1437/3605	Am I then to remain here eternally demanded Milady with a certain	402.81427001953125
1438/3605	Do you find yourself badly lodged sister Demand anything you want and I will hasten to have you furnished with	523.2449951171875
1439/3605	But I have neither my women nor my	153.2790985107422
1440/3605	Tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although I am only your brotherinlaw I will arrange one	266.38897705078125
1441/3605	My first husband cried Milady looking at Lord de Winter with eyes almost starting from their	295.78924560546875
1442/3605	If you have forgotten as he is still living I can write to him and he will send me information on the	41.876220703125
1443/3605	A cold sweat burst from the brow of Mil	179.19680786132812
1444/3605	You jest said she in a hollow	110.59890747070312
1445/3605	Do I look so asked the baron rising and going a step	194.59422302246094
1446/3605	Or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her	386.3568420410156
1447/3605	I insult you said Lord de Winter with	129.89077758789062
1448/3605	In truth madame do you think that can be possible   Indeed sir said Milady you must be either drunk or	63.34737777709961
1449/3605	Leave the room and send me a	148.5507354736328
1450/3605	Cannot I serve you as a waiting maid By that means all our secrets will remain in the	487.6974792480469
1451/3605	Insolent cried Milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his	205.49806213378906
1452/3605	I know you are accustomed to assassinate people but I warn you I shall defend myself even against	62.14570617675781
1453/3605	You have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a	137.16873168945312
1454/3605	Perhaps so and I have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you I	73.9999771118164
1455/3605	And the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of Milady which he almost touched with his	167.11639404296875
1456/3605	Milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a	216.1863250732422
1457/3605	Oh growl as much as you please cried Lord de Winter but dont try to bite for I warn you that it would be to your	106.19424438476562
1458/3605	There are here no procurators who regulate successions	14884.591796875
1459/3605	And these judges I warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders	197.97764587402344
1460/3605	The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole	352.77667236328125
1461/3605	Not a penny of what I possess will pass into your	218.12066650390625
1462/3605	I will be silent but you must endure your captivity	249.91265869140625
1463/3605	In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the	113.45845794677734
1464/3605	And be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the	113.32625579833984
1465/3605	Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed	410.0185852050781
1466/3605	Yes at present continued Lord de Winter you will remain in this	68.80779266357422
1467/3605	The walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window opens immediately over the	2241.35546875
1468/3605	The men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the	215.64939880371094
1469/3605	Even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to	226.56207275390625
1470/3605	A step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired	298.67230224609375
1471/3605	If they kill you English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it	353.06005859375
1472/3605	Ah I see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its	1223.202392578125
1473/3605	You are saying to yourself Fifteen days twenty days Bah I have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to	1895.1962890625
1474/3605	Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from	129.7927703857422
1475/3605	Ah try it   Milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except	684.4323120117188
1476/3605	Lord de Winter continued The officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know	149.52020263671875
1477/3605	He knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not I am sure come from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him	153.5618438720703
1478/3605	What do you say of him Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute You have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but I give you leave to try them upon this	275.1785583496094
1479/3605	_Pardieu_ if you succeed with him I pronounce you the demon	268.58868408203125
1480/3605	He went toward the door and opened it	64.37454223632812
1481/3605	Wait a minute longer and I will introduce him to	117.341064453125
1482/3605	There followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard	139.48077392578125
1483/3605	Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the bar	72.5723876953125
1484/3605	Come in my dear John said Lord de Winter come in and shut the	116.25609588623047
1485/3605	Now said the baron look at this	88.56519317626953
1486/3605	She is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly sed	11460.4443359375
1487/3605	Well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribun	115.43909454345703
1488/3605	Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promisesI must do her that	2300.264404296875
1489/3605	She will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill	352.26483154296875
1490/3605	I have extricated you from misery Felton I have caused you to be named lieutenant I once saved your life you know on what	199.94642639160156
1491/3605	I am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a	75.10189056396484
1492/3605	This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my	110.86174774169922
1493/3605	I hold this serpent in my	183.55258178710938
1494/3605	Well I call you and say to you Friend Felton John my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this	838.5939331054688
1495/3605	Swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has mer	434.79571533203125
1496/3605	John Felton I trust your word John Felton I put faith in your loyalty   My Lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my Lord I swear all shall be done as you	309.9825439453125
1497/3605	Milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful count	142.93096923828125
1498/3605	Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a	484.6473693847656
1499/3605	She is not to leave this chamber understand John continued the bar	286.49468994140625
1500/3605	She is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but youif you will do her the honor to address a word to	170.8035125732422
1501/3605	That is sufficient my Lord I have	193.8509063720703
1502/3605	And now madame try to make your peace with God for you are judged by men   Milady let her head sink as if crushed by this	251.33201599121094
1503/3605	Lord de Winter went out making a sign to Felton who followed him shutting the door after	165.04283142089844
1504/3605	One instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his	232.844482421875
1505/3605	OFFICER     Meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England but no news arrived that was not annoying and	374.3902282714844
1506/3605	Although La Rochelle was invested however certain success might appearthanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged citythe blockade might last a long time	1430.658447265625
1507/3605	This was a great affront to the kings army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil Louis	150.26638793945312
1508/3605	with Anne of Austriafor that affair was overbut he had to adjust matters for	429.35107421875
1509/3605	de Bassompierre who was embroiled with the Duc dAngoulê	996.4534301757812
1510/3605	As to Monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing	123.27444458007812
1511/3605	The city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender the mayor had hanged the mutine	955.1996459960938
1512/3605	This execution quieted the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strang	987.808837890625
1513/3605	On their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham or the spies which Buckingham sent to the Rochella	484.82537841796875
1514/3605	In one case or the other the trial was soon	213.36122131347656
1515/3605	The cardinal pronounced the single word Hanged The king was invited to come and see the	575.0360107421875
1516/3605	He came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the	221.62266540527344
1517/3605	Nevertheless time passed on and the Rochellais did not	374.0947265625
1518/3605	The last spy that was taken was the bearer of a	161.91676330566406
1519/3605	The Rochellais then had no hope but in	495.18280029296875
1520/3605	It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham their courage would fail with their	378.8746337890625
1521/3605	The cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not	142.4481658935547
1522/3605	The question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always	895.6530151367188
1523/3605	In the first place La Rochelle appeared impregn	130.26492309570312
1524/3605	Then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which Frenchman would combat against Frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of	829.7149658203125
1525/3605	In fact the sack of La Rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of	534.2366943359375
1526/3605	Bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good Catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsLa Rochelle is impregnable except to	1379.9317626953125
1527/3605	The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a	242.28973388671875
1528/3605	And yet he reckoned and with reason on Mil	572.7127075195312
1529/3605	He resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate	284.44268798828125
1530/3605	He continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Roc	1020.0059204101562
1531/3605	Meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of Louis	784.306396484375
1532/3605	his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of Robespierre he repeated this maxim of Tristans gossip Divide in order to	1067.235595703125
1533/3605	when besieging Paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the	7797.08251953125
1534/3605	The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the Rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their	830.5675659179688
1535/3605	Up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it	722.5303344726562
1536/3605	These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal	302.999267578125
1537/3605	Still further Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against France and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English Imperial and Spanish	439.3266906738281
1538/3605	This letter was read publicly in all parts of the	285.1401672363281
1539/3605	Copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously	335.5502014160156
1540/3605	This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieus former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the	100.5172348022461
1541/3605	During this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the	561.6367797851562
1542/3605	All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and ga	11260.4189453125
1543/3605	Four of these men were our Musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just	102.57295227050781
1544/3605	This letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drum	332.1321716308594
1545/3605	The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure wine these were the lackeys of these	948.7320556640625
1546/3605	The cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in	418.15509033203125
1547/3605	Besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of	718.2094116210938
1548/3605	It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this	112.58448028564453
1549/3605	You are speaking you scoundrel said Athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming	218.98585510253906
1550/3605	Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his	293.2006530761719
1551/3605	With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet and saluted with	152.20074462890625
1552/3605	It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard said	581.8558959960938
1553/3605	Lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentin	350.0011291503906
1554/3605	Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting	164.1405029296875
1555/3605	DArtagnan continued Athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to Monseigneur here it is avail yourself of	121.8333740234375
1556/3605	These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished Athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by	198.1724090576172
1557/3605	DArtagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the	65.7762451171875
1558/3605	It does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which Athos had started it does not signify	228.01663208007812
1559/3605	I do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody	226.48634338378906
1560/3605	Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of ass	291.19305419921875
1561/3605	Then he resumed in his turn Discipline Monseigneur has I hope in no way been forgotten by	402.2706604003906
1562/3605	We are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we	97.02070617675781
1563/3605	If we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your Eminence we are ready to obey	104.63223266601562
1564/3605	Your Eminence may perceive continued Athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our	162.45315551757812
1565/3605	And he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and	135.75489807128906
1566/3605	Your Eminence may believe added DArtagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward us with so few	97.60444641113281
1567/3605	The cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a	191.65817260742188
1568/3605	Do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the	97.06670379638672
1569/3605	Oh as to that Monseigneur it is true said Athos we do conspire as your Eminence might have seen the other	88.02791595458984
1570/3605	Ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me	245.38726806640625
1571/3605	The color mounted to the face of Athos and he made a step toward his Emin	51.86787033081055
1572/3605	One might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrog	249.9407958984375
1573/3605	If it be so we trust your Eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real	216.21240234375
1574/3605	And if it were an interrogatory replied the	165.76434326171875
1575/3605	Others besides you have undergone such Monsieur Athos and have replied	498.7499084472656
1576/3605	Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to	103.0263671875
1577/3605	What was that letter you were about to read Monsieur Aramis and which you so promptly concealed   A womans letter monseign	53.83893966674805
1578/3605	Ah yes I see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know I have taken	81.1722640991211
1579/3605	Monseigneur said Athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a womans letter but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme nor Madame dAigu	220.7206268310547
1580/3605	The cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his	232.72361755371094
1581/3605	He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdini	747.6783447265625
1582/3605	Athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be	104.31499481201172
1583/3605	The cardinalists were three the Musketeers lackeys included were	1078.8023681640625
1584/3605	He judged that the match would be so much the less equal if Athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a	298.630859375
1585/3605	Well well said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in	385.5222473144531
1586/3605	We can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over	378.2660827636719
1587/3605	Gentlemen I have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red Dove	637.791015625
1588/3605	If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am going I would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your	153.5665283203125
1589/3605	Adieu gentlemen   And remounting his horse which Cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode	277.4788818359375
1590/3605	The four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had	78.14370727539062
1591/3605	The countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his Eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his	191.2445526123047
1592/3605	Athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful	143.1222686767578
1593/3605	When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight That Grimaud kept bad watch cried Porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on	197.3331756591797
1594/3605	Grimaud was about to reply to excuse	188.0746307373047
1595/3605	Athos lifted his finger and Grimaud was	152.14183044433594
1596/3605	Would you have given up the letter Aramis said DArtagn	26.8690128326416
1597/3605	I said Aramis in his most flutelike tone I had made up my	132.81434631347656
1598/3605	If he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him I would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other I would have run my sword through his	59.56061935424805
1599/3605	I expected as much said Athos and that was why I threw myself between you and	129.7839813232422
1600/3605	Indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and	132.80111694335938
1601/3605	My dear Athos I admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after	113.8343276977539
1602/3605	One might have supposed the Bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic Medusa had converted you into	595.94775390625
1603/3605	Is being in love conspiring You are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the	105.85465240478516
1604/3605	Thats a match you are playing with his Eminence this letter is your	260.0777893066406
1605/3605	Why should you expose your game to your adversary That is never	423.1557922363281
1606/3605	Let him find it out if he can We can find out his   Well thats all very sensible Athos said DArtagn	75.02500915527344
1607/3605	In that case let there be no more question of whats past and let Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted	241.8970184326172
1608/3605	Aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine	338.390869140625
1609/3605	You had only read a line or two said DArtagnan read the letter again from the	76.77550506591797
1610/3605	Nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be I believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of	145.8473663330078
1611/3605	Meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her	358.26544189453125
1612/3605	I know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as I have given you proofs my dear cousin I am not unskilled in such affairs and I will take charge of the	235.04049682617188
1613/3605	My sister thanks you for your good and eternal	1115.8291015625
1614/3605	She has experienced much anxiety but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen	379.4747009277344
1615/3605	Tell us news of yourself as often as you     can that is to say as often as you can with	182.3712921142578
1616/3605	I embrace    	113.6072769165039
1617/3605	MARIE MICHON     Oh what do I not owe you Aramis said DArtagn	315.99981689453125
1618/3605	Dear Constance I have at length then intelligence of	464.8552551269531
1619/3605	She lives she is in safety in a convent she is at Béthune Where is Béthune Athos   Why upon the frontiers of Artois and of F	430.9488830566406
1620/3605	The siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that	87.34783172607422
1621/3605	And that will not be long it is to be hoped said Porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were reduced to the leather of their	199.00050354003906
1622/3605	Supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles I cannot see much that is left unless they eat one	456.9832458496094
1623/3605	Why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket   Yes said DArtagnan Athos is right it must be	113.08280944824219
1624/3605	And yet if we burn it who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes   He must have one said Ath	141.82936096191406
1625/3605	What will you do with the letter then asked Porth	23.452594757080078
1626/3605	As a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of	130.7541961669922
1627/3605	Grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed	94.76762390136719
1628/3605	Bravo Monsieur Grimaud said Athos and now take	59.69252014160156
1629/3605	Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less	385.9046325683594
1630/3605	And now said Athos unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up Grimaud I think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the	256.89794921875
1631/3605	Meantime his Eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches These four men must positively be	1333.751220703125

1633/3605	We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflectiona dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she	367.668701171875
1634/3605	On two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her that she has	665.4119262695312
1635/3605	DArtagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of	431.86822509765625
1636/3605	He has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her	582.4468994140625
1637/3605	Still more he has lifted the corner of her maskthat shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so	330.59649658203125
1638/3605	DArtagnan has turned aside from Buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him in the person of the	149.2680206298828
1639/3605	DArtagnan had passed himself upon her as De Wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her	399.400634765625
1640/3605	DArtagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without	114.00375366210938
1641/3605	All this she owes to DArtagnan without	151.15679931640625
1642/3605	From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from him He alone could have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of	404.41534423828125
1643/3605	Bonacieux against Buckingham but above all against DArtagnanprojects lost in the distance of the	185.24490356445312
1644/3605	Yes but in order to avenge herself she must be	76.52751159667969
1645/3605	And to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floorall undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give	474.14599609375
1646/3605	Besides to do all this time is necessarymonths years and she has ten or twelve days as Lord de Winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told	296.6742248535156
1647/3605	But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in rep	2076.179443359375
1648/3605	Go to go to I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate	224.16900634765625
1649/3605	No violence violence is the proof of	812.7694702148438
1650/3605	In the first place I have never succeeded by that	52.542091369628906

1652/3605	Let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my	194.54913330078125
1653/3605	Then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her	436.50555419921875
1654/3605	At length she murmured satisfied with herself Come nothing is lost I am still	458.78668212890625
1655/3605	It was then nearly eight oclock in the	31.875890731811523
1656/3605	Milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her	209.2782440185547
1657/3605	A better idea however came into her mind before going to	696.8005981445312
1658/3605	She had heard something said about	910.0685424804688
1659/3605	She had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a rep	141.2758026123047
1660/3605	The prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was	132.84912109375
1661/3605	A light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jail	216.86776733398438
1662/3605	Milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging	290.0438232421875
1663/3605	The bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its	405.0018005371094
1664/3605	Steps sounded in the chamber and drew	106.31101989746094
1665/3605	Place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of Fel	289.175048828125
1666/3605	You will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued Fel	2680.042724609375
1667/3605	And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say	326.1689453125
1668/3605	Feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained	193.87014770507812
1669/3605	At length Felton who had not yet looked at Milady turned toward	250.07847595214844
1670/3605	Ah ah said he she is asleep thats	315.5295715332031
1671/3605	And he made some steps toward the	85.39447021484375
1672/3605	But my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached Milady this woman is not	442.32244873046875
1673/3605	What not asleep said Felton what is she doing then   She has f	353.28607177734375
1674/3605	Her face is very pale and I have listened in vain I do not hear her	123.04951477050781
1675/3605	You are right said Felton after having looked at Milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward	260.71240234375
1676/3605	Go and tell Lord de Winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not having been foreseen I dont know what to	97.55005645751953
1677/3605	The soldier went out to obey the orders of his	152.61367797851562
1678/3605	Felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a	69.35433959960938
1679/3605	Milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the l	552.2172241210938
1680/3605	She perceived Felton who sat with his back toward	969.652587890625
1681/3605	She continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round	132.44619750976562
1682/3605	She then thought that Lord de Winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jail	139.77505493164062
1683/3605	Her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her	1416.157470703125
1684/3605	As a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed	138.4226531982422
1685/3605	Ah you are awake madame he said then I have nothing more to do	43.696067810058594
1686/3605	If you want anything you can	344.2342529296875
1687/3605	Oh my God my God how I have suffered said Milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to	264.538330078125
1688/3605	And she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she recl	407.753173828125
1689/3605	You will be served thus madame three times a day said	107.9344711303711
1690/3605	In the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at	22.462465286254883
1691/3605	If that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied	189.90977478027344
1692/3605	But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked Mil	567.7363891601562
1693/3605	A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her	335.01141357421875
1694/3605	I thank you sir replied the prisoner hum	58.44338607788086
1695/3605	Felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the	69.73353576660156
1696/3605	At the moment he was about to go out Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of Mil	48.590049743652344
1697/3605	He held a vial of salts in his	180.6459197998047
1698/3605	Well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go	161.4892120361328
1699/3605	These words of Feltons passed like ice through her	3108.0859375
1700/3605	In that case my brave lieutenant let us leave Milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy She has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the	178.9746856689453
1701/3605	And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton and led him out	218.7539520263672
1702/3605	On my honor they are not	161.61654663085938
1703/3605	I have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir I have full and perfect confidence in	74.52799987792969
1704/3605	Adieu dear sister till your next swoon   This was all that Milady could	374.8675842285156
1705/3605	Her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized	258.58734130859375
1706/3605	She cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was	144.72120666503906
1707/3605	The blade was round and of flexible	2404.286376953125
1708/3605	A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door	121.10588073730469
1709/3605	Ha ha cried Lord de Winter ha ha Dont you see my brave Felton dont you see what I told you That knife was for you my lad she would have killed	313.83428955078125
1710/3605	Observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother	493.3496398925781
1711/3605	If I had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of	118.17862701416016
1712/3605	Then no more of Felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody el	903.7000732421875
1713/3605	See John see how well she knows how to handle a	874.4760131835938
1714/3605	In fact Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her	663.3163452148438
1715/3605	You were right my Lord said Felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady you were right my Lord and I was	209.12112426757812
1716/3605	But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the	169.45880126953125
1717/3605	I am lost murmured she I am lost I am in the power of men upon whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my	221.35366821289062
1718/3605	It is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed   In fact as this last reflection indicatedthis instinctive return to hopesentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent	480.0888366699219
1719/3605	Milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little Spanish wine and felt all her resolution	653.3908081054688
1720/3605	One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner If I had listened to you Lord de Winter had said to Fel	188.34271240234375
1721/3605	Felton then had spoken in her favor since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to	74.4792251586914
1722/3605	Weak or strong repeated Milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour	545.9219360351562
1723/3605	As to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his	119.25923919677734
1724/3605	It is useless then to attempt anything with	229.3605194091797
1725/3605	He is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of	686.7753295898438
1726/3605	And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her	51.34621810913086
1727/3605	Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next	166.03115844726562
1728/3605	She slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first	1026.6357421875
1729/3605	In the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in	61.24711990356445
1730/3605	He brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching Miladys bed offered her	145.47999572753906
1731/3605	Milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first	315.7979431152344
1732/3605	I am in a fever said she I have not slept a single instant during all this long	129.6639862060547
1733/3605	Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday All I ask is permission to remain ab	565.1692504882812
1734/3605	Would you like to have a physician called said the	166.08349609375
1735/3605	Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a	198.31060791015625
1736/3605	Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and Lord de Winter would redouble his	209.3882293701172
1737/3605	Besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and Milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the	456.62554931640625
1738/3605	Go and fetch a physician said	262.5732116699219
1739/3605	What could be the good of that These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy it would be just the same today no doubtfor since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a	171.04811096191406
1740/3605	Then said Felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish	2014.5457763671875
1741/3605	Eh how can I tell My God I know that I suffer thats	109.3697280883789
1742/3605	Give me anything you like it is of little	306.7329406738281
1743/3605	Go and fetch Lord de Winter said Felton tired of these eternal	1377.14794921875
1744/3605	Oh no no cried Milady no sir do not call him I conjure	121.56433868408203
1745/3605	I am well I want nothing do not call	92.49891662597656
1746/3605	She gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the	217.97872924804688
1747/3605	Meanwhile madame if you really suffer said Felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive uswell it will be the worse for	169.1303253173828
1748/3605	But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with	75.10540008544922
1749/3605	Milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking so	442.4618835449219
1750/3605	Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went	269.8490295410156
1751/3605	The woman followed him and Lord de Winter did not	80.66229248046875
1752/3605	I fancy I begin to see my way murmured Milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward	349.30804443359375
1753/3605	Now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very	195.246337890625
1754/3605	I have but ten days and this evening two of them will be	80.27510070800781
1755/3605	In the morning when they entered Miladys chamber they had brought her	226.5283660888672
1756/3605	Now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that Felton would then reapp	461.54217529296875
1757/3605	Felton reappeared and without observing whether Milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready	153.43434143066406
1758/3605	Felton remained behind he held a book in his	136.22865295410156
1759/3605	Milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyr	358.578369140625
1760/3605	Bartholomew they sometimes came to seek	1294.4560546875
1761/3605	She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their	396.5020751953125
1762/3605	I will tell it cried Milady with a feigned exultation on the day when I shall have suffered sufficiently for my	220.5943603515625
1763/3605	The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single	436.56781005859375
1764/3605	The young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had	204.49095153808594
1765/3605	I am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Pur	87.72412109375
1766/3605	Well let my God save me or let me perish for my God That is the reply I beg you to make to Lord de	108.2737045288086
1767/3605	Felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensive	84.033203125
1768/3605	Lord de Winter came toward five oclock in the	43.8160514831543
1769/3605	Milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of	262.1139831542969
1770/3605	She received him like a woman who had already recovered all her	150.7515411376953
1771/3605	You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband have you   Explain yourself my Lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though I hear your words I declare I do not understand	199.17518615722656
1772/3605	Then you have no religion at all I like that best replied Lord de Winter	174.26271057128906
1773/3605	Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied Milady frigid	1040.8590087890625
1774/3605	Oh I confess it is all the same to	38.96237564086914
1775/3605	Oh you need not avow this religious indifference my Lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for	770.7015380859375
1776/3605	My jailers and my hangmen Heyday madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this	288.92822265625
1777/3605	As to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be	101.50757598876953
1778/3605	Infamous task impious task cried Milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his	1484.408447265625
1779/3605	My word said de Winter rising I think the hussy is going mad Come come calm yourself Madame Puritan or Ill remove you to a	884.5044555664062
1780/3605	Its my Spanish wine that has got into your head is it not But never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad	176.64707946777344
1781/3605	And Lord de Winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly	1021.7953491210938
1782/3605	Felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this	73.31798553466797
1783/3605	Yes go go said she to her brother the effects _are_ drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun	271.55072021484375
1784/3605	Miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloudprayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere Pur	661.05615234375
1785/3605	She appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around	58.93409729003906
1786/3605	Felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the	60.0070686340332
1787/3605	Milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to	100.05055236816406
1788/3605	For the moment she wished nothing	334.55072021484375
1789/3605	She arose came to the table ate but little and drank only	624.2003784179688
1790/3605	An hour after her table was cleared but Milady remarked that this time Felton did not accompany the	415.6382141113281
1791/3605	He feared then to see her too	198.41351318359375
1792/3605	She turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed	153.6507568359375
1793/3605	These verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their	255.54644775390625
1794/3605	The soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into	144.18345642089844
1795/3605	Milady was then able to judge of the effect she had	173.27171325683594
1796/3605	Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and	174.62620544433594
1797/3605	It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jail	340.6994934082031
1798/3605	Silence then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized as that of Fel	970.0924072265625
1799/3605	What are you meddling with stupid Did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing	854.0090942382812
1800/3605	You were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to	523.954345703125
1801/3605	Guard her If she flies kill her but dont exceed your	2571.153564453125
1802/3605	An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of	285.0994873046875
1803/3605	Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three Hebrews in the	1238.9603271484375
1804/3605	Milady continued   One day our doors will ope     With God come our desire And if betrays that hope     To death we can	368.0191650390625
1805/3605	This verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young	491.23016357421875
1806/3605	He opened the door quickly and Milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost	168.52865600585938
1807/3605	Why do you sing thus and with such a voice said	131.9168243408203
1808/3605	Your pardon sir said Milady with mild	524.0418090820312
1809/3605	I forgot that my songs are out of place in this	193.6676025390625
1810/3605	I have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so I	113.90860748291016
1811/3605	Pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was	610.0281372070312
1812/3605	Milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before	152.76425170898438
1813/3605	Yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the	149.92405700683594
1814/3605	The poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while Milady was reading with her lynxs eyes the very depths of his	1114.7496337890625
1815/3605	I will be silent then said Milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her	276.15850830078125
1816/3605	No no madame said Felton only do not sing so loud particularly at	813.3328247070312
1817/3605	And at these words Felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the	353.1888732910156
1818/3605	You have done right Lieutenant said the	452.8887023925781
1819/3605	Such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so	311.2208557128906
1820/3605	CAPTIVITY THE THIRD DAY     Felton had fallen but there was still another step to be	16326.5859375
1821/3605	He must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and Milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this	370.3377380371094
1822/3605	He must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor Milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language	551.1029052734375
1823/3605	Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might failfor Felton was forewarned and that against the least	756.816162109375
1824/3605	From that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestureseven to a breath that could be interpreted as a	305.75335693359375
1825/3605	In short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not	402.42779541015625
1826/3605	Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more	265.93084716796875
1827/3605	She had laid that down the preceding	215.3572540283203
1828/3605	To remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignationsuch was her	318.5948486328125
1829/3605	Felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would	88.4138412475586
1830/3605	In the morning Felton came as usual but Milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to	335.5924377441406
1831/3605	It was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale English sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her	598.3143920898438
1832/3605	Milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it	88.1805419921875
1833/3605	Ah ah said Lord de Winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy   The prisoner made no	297.1782531738281
1834/3605	Yes yes continued Lord de Winter I	43.61796188354492
1835/3605	Patience patience In four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to youmore open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days England will be relieved of	267.3168640136719
1836/3605	Milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven Lord Lord said she with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone pardon this man as I myself pardon	597.2662963867188
1837/3605	Yes pray accursed woman cried the baron your prayer is so much the more generous from your being I swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you and he went	73.69780731201172
1838/3605	At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived Felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by	276.095703125
1839/3605	Then she threw herself upon her knees and began to	79.4254150390625
1840/3605	My God my God said she thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer give me then strength to	366.3551330566406
1841/3605	I do not like to disturb those who pray madame said Felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account I beseech	97.52079772949219
1842/3605	How do you know I was praying sir said Milady in a voice broken by so	127.08634948730469
1843/3605	You were deceived sir I was not	260.49603271484375
1844/3605	Guilty Oh my God thou knowest whether I am guilty Say I am condemned sir if you please but you know that God who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be	320.0421447753906
1845/3605	Were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied Felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and I myself would aid you with my	684.8677978515625
1846/3605	Oh you are a just man cried Milady throwing herself at his	147.13621520996094
1847/3605	I can hold out no longer for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my	94.59899139404297
1848/3605	Listen then to the supplication of a despairing	266.7157897949219
1849/3605	You are abused sir but that is not the	147.56158447265625
1850/3605	I only ask you one favor and if you grant it me I will bless you in this world and in the	63.57029342651367
1851/3605	Speak to the master madame said Felton happily I am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor	895.8546752929688
1852/3605	It is upon one higher placed than I am that God has laid this	832.6947021484375
1853/3605	What do you say Oh you do not understand me When I speak of ignominy you think I speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or	104.68868255615234
1854/3605	Would to heaven Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death   It is I who no longer understand you madame said Fel	284.7541198730469
1855/3605	Or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredul	77.76648712158203
1856/3605	No madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a	46.650962829589844
1857/3605	What you are ignorant of Lord de Winters designs upon me   I	39.410457611083984
1858/3605	Impossible you are his confidant   I never lie mad	108.6169662475586
1859/3605	Oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine	534.8428344726562
1860/3605	I seek to divine nothing madame I wait till I am confided in and apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to	103.43329620361328
1861/3605	Good said Milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime Then aloud The friend of that wretch is capable of	142.50978088378906
1862/3605	Whom do you call _that wretch_ asked Fel	1467.1634521484375
1863/3605	Are there then in England two men to whom such an epithet can be applied   You mean George Villiers asked Felton whose looks became	1453.1138916015625
1864/3605	Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham replied Mil	8844.3232421875
1865/3605	I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all England who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom I was	58.5649299621582
1866/3605	The hand of the Lord is stretched over him said Felton he will not escape the chastisement he	816.8058471679688
1867/3605	Felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the Catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the Puritans styled simply	1015.6445922851562
1868/3605	At length he interrogates me said Milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great	305.74505615234375
1869/3605	Oh know him Yes yes to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and Milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of	157.87081909179688
1870/3605	Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped	117.38096618652344
1871/3605	He still doubts thought Milady I have not been earnest	355.4840393066406
1872/3605	Someone was heard in the corridor Milady recognized the step of Lord de	92.6889419555664
1873/3605	Felton recognized it also and made a step toward the	173.7655029296875
1874/3605	Felton gently repulsed Milady and she sank into a	209.32823181152344
1875/3605	Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die	111.32234954833984
1876/3605	Felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the	194.8486328125
1877/3605	Ah said Milady listening in her turn to the noise of Feltons steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter at length you are mine   Then her brow	212.27406311035156
1878/3605	If he tells the baron said she I am lostfor the baron who knows very well that I shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but	89.6916275024414
1879/3605	She placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more	254.26905822753906
1880/3605	Oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell him   In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the	94.41644287109375
1881/3605	Sir said Milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me   How dear sister said Lord de	370.465087890625
1882/3605	Besides this time my visit has a	244.3070831298828
1883/3605	Milady trembled she thought Felton had told	1754.7987060546875
1884/3605	Perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so	255.8986053466797
1885/3605	Lord de Winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside	146.53981018066406
1886/3605	Then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it	160.46072387695312
1887/3605	Here said he I want to show you the kind of passport which I have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life I consent to leave	85.02788543701172
1888/3605	Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper he read Order to conduct The name is blank interrupted Lord de	600.2804565429688
1889/3605	If you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London attention will be paid to your	146.1514434814453
1890/3605	I will begin again then   Order to conduct tothe person named Charlotte Backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of France but liberated after chastis	1305.083984375
1891/3605	She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from	215.23538208007812
1892/3605	In case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be	105.49597930908203
1893/3605	She will receive five shillings per day for lodging and	3543.25830078125
1894/3605	That order does not concern me replied Milady coldly since it bears another name than	301.7153625488281
1895/3605	A name Have you a name then   I bear that of your	69.16569519042969
1896/3605	My brother is only your second husband and your first is still	248.98985290527344
1897/3605	Tell me his name and I will put it in the place of the name of Charlotte Back	204.98358154296875
1898/3605	No You will not You are silent Well then you must be registered as Charlotte Back	1135.0439453125
1899/3605	Milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from	281.7250671386719
1900/3605	She believed the order ready for	682.58203125
1901/3605	She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure she thought she was condemned to set off that very	91.9562759399414
1902/3605	Everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the	80.70318603515625
1903/3605	The joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal	118.2931900024414
1904/3605	Yes yes said Lord de Winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself All is not lost for that order is not	111.42266845703125
1905/3605	It is only shown to me to terrify me thats	193.83685302734375
1906/3605	Tomorrow this order will be sent to the Duke of	53.03620147705078
1907/3605	The day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal and fourandtwenty hours afterward I will answer for its being carried into	126.34918212890625
1908/3605	That is all I had to say to	27.619749069213867
1909/3605	And I reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous   Would you like better to be hanged in your true name Milady You know that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of	230.02293395996094
1910/3605	Although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of	99.08723449707031
1911/3605	Milady made no reply but became as pale as a	130.38487243652344
1912/3605	Thats well madame and there is an old proverb that says Traveling trains	3706.916259765625
1913/3605	My faith you are not wrong after all and life is	311.102783203125
1914/3605	Thats the reason why I take such care you shall not deprive me of	123.28038024902344
1915/3605	There only remains then the question of the five shillings to be	507.9896545410156
1916/3605	You think me rather parsimonious dont you Thats because I dont care to leave you the means of corrupting your jail	1042.1541748046875
1917/3605	Besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them	2766.278564453125
1918/3605	Employ them if your check with regard to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that	2504.8701171875
1919/3605	Felton has not told him said Milady to	171.6826171875
1920/3605	And now madame till I see you again Tomorrow I will come and announce to you the departure of my	90.85643768310547
1921/3605	Lord de Winter rose saluted her ironically and went	300.5991516113281
1922/3605	She had still four days before	149.31793212890625
1923/3605	Four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Fel	8969.53515625
1924/3605	A terrible idea however rushed into her	741.2301635742188
1925/3605	She thought that Lord de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the Duke of	263.543212890625
1926/3605	In that case Felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was	2289.1953125
1927/3605	Nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured	405.2293395996094
1928/3605	As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter she placed herself at the table and	53.546287536621094
1929/3605	Then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers	100.60272216796875
1930/3605	As on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to	125.44731140136719
1931/3605	Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her	155.56434631347656
1932/3605	And she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited Felton the evening	2700.690673828125
1933/3605	But although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained	2294.615966796875
1934/3605	It appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow	83.50959777832031
1935/3605	But whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to	310.04595947265625
1936/3605	However a few instants after she had finished her religious song Milady thought she heard a profound	502.1485290527344
1937/3605	Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with	615.6589965820312
1938/3605	At the noise Felton made in entering Milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her	297.0447998046875
1939/3605	The young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish	80.98397827148438
1940/3605	Nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than	1752.4991455078125
1941/3605	He advanced slowly toward Milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen What is this madame he asked cold	285.27001953125
1942/3605	That Nothing said Milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her	214.9188995361328
1943/3605	Ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners I had ennui and I amused myself with twisting that	1464.8175048828125
1944/3605	He started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped	409.4925842285156
1945/3605	What were you doing on that armchair asked	113.67339324951172
1946/3605	But replied Felton I wish to	543.5325317382812
1947/3605	Do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true Christians are forbidden to	233.7161407470703
1948/3605	Well then said Felton I will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your	147.98280334472656
1949/3605	Remember madame if our God forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns	5734.7080078125
1950/3605	When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied Milady in a tone of deep conviction God pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyr	938.3591918945312
1951/3605	You say either too much or too little speak mad	442.05657958984375
1952/3605	In the name of heaven explain	405.419921875
1953/3605	That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor No	90.60836029052734
1954/3605	You suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life Oh you cannot believe what you say   Let me act as I please Felton let me act as I please said Milady el	172.6504364013672
1955/3605	Every soldier must be ambitious must he not You are a lieutenant Well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of	188.5329132080078
1956/3605	But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling Cruel enough if I am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the Lord give it if I am innocent   I am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders I have	190.13494873046875
1957/3605	Do you believe then that at the day of the Last Judgment God will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges You are not willing that I should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my	630.696044921875
1958/3605	But I repeat it again to you replied Felton in great emotion no danger threatens you I will answer for Lord de Winter as for	198.70664978027344
1959/3605	Impossible madame impossible murmured Felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this	421.3254089355469
1960/3605	A prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through	142.90452575683594
1961/3605	Yes cried Milady but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life I shall lose my honor Felton and it is you you whom I make responsible before God and before men for my shame and my inf	162.61537170410156
1962/3605	This time Felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of	153.2110595703125
1963/3605	She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young	1054.233154296875
1964/3605	Felton stood before this strange apparition like one pet	176.86343383789062
1965/3605	Who art thou Who art thou cried he clasping his	119.8727035522461
1966/3605	Yes yes said Felton I doubted but now I	744.9865112304688
1967/3605	Yes yes said Felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last	353.2464904785156
1968/3605	A flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of Mil	229.5420379638672
1969/3605	However fugitive this homicide flash Felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this womans	1104.1463623046875
1970/3605	He recalled all at once the warnings of Lord de Winter the seductions of Milady her first attempts after her	840.6226196289062
1971/3605	He drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her	70.8850326538086
1972/3605	Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this	347.702392578125
1973/3605	Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned	1540.3699951171875
1974/3605	The sword of the eternal is too heavy for my	421.19146728515625
1975/3605	Allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyr	220.4673309326172
1976/3605	I do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a	587.8848876953125
1977/3605	I supplicate you I implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my pres	84.48641204833984
1978/3605	Hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast Felton reproached	1301.6756591796875
1979/3605	Alas said Felton I can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim But Lord de Winter makes cruel accusations against	229.06597900390625
1980/3605	You are a Christian you are my sister in	215.8961181640625
1981/3605	I feel myself drawn toward youI who have never loved anyone but my benefactorI who have met with nothing but traitors and impious	142.82215881347656
1982/3605	But you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you	589.5152587890625
1983/3605	They have eyes repeated Milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear	215.3255157470703
1984/3605	Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fasc	225.67286682128906
1985/3605	Felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his	223.76437377929688
1986/3605	He paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he	96.48738098144531
1987/3605	During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly and when Lord de Winter entered he was several paces from the	176.27557373046875
1988/3605	The baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young	234.52561950683594
1989/3605	You have been here a very long time John said	159.66307067871094
1990/3605	Has this woman been relating her crimes to you In that case I can comprehend the length of the	309.7278137207031
1991/3605	Felton started and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Pur	93.4244613647461
1992/3605	Ah you fear your prisoner should escape said	449.8702392578125
1993/3605	Well ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of	724.5423583984375
1994/3605	You demanded a favor said the baron suspicious	258.2977294921875
1995/3605	Yes my Lord replied the young man	202.98475646972656
1996/3605	And what favor pray asked Lord de	272.5657043457031
1997/3605	A knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied Fel	233.6194305419922
1998/3605	There is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de Winter in an ironical contemptuous	207.88760375976562
1999/3605	I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn replied Lord de	363.0521545410156
2000/3605	Believe me the cord is more certain than the	331.28656005859375
2001/3605	Felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her	131.24285888671875
2002/3605	You are right said she I have often thought of	33.81248474121094
2003/3605	Then she added in a low voice And I will think of it	46.56776428222656
2004/3605	Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably Lord de Winter perceived this	330.49578857421875
2005/3605	I have placed reliance upon you my	194.53326416015625
2006/3605	Beware I have warned you But be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where I shall send her she can harm	297.2442932128906
2007/3605	You hear him cried Milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that Felton might understand she was addressing	272.95599365234375
2008/3605	The baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone	63.987548828125
2009/3605	Well said the prisoner when the door was shut I am not so far advanced as I	125.18987274169922
2010/3605	De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prud	289.8538513183594
2011/3605	It is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man As to Felton he hes	2437.775146484375
2012/3605	Ah he is not a man like that cursed DArtagn	30.167156219482422
2013/3605	A Puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his	533.3926391601562
2014/3605	A Musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round	221.6717987060547
2015/3605	Milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing Felton	585.7018432617188
2016/3605	At last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the	57.281455993652344
2017/3605	Presently the door opened and she perceived Fel	1690.892822265625
2018/3605	The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to Milady to be silent his face was much	87.90815734863281
2019/3605	What do you want with me said	20.656217575073242
2020/3605	Listen replied Felton in a low	516.731201171875
2021/3605	I have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being	70.23500061035156
2022/3605	The baron has just related a frightful story to	88.94841766357422
2023/3605	Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her	639.1384887695312
2024/3605	Either you are a demon continued Felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a	879.7488403320312
2025/3605	I have known you four days I have loved him four	68.49758911132812
2026/3605	Be not alarmed at what I say I want to be	108.57434844970703
2027/3605	Tonight after twelve I will come and see you and you shall convince	73.87274169921875
2028/3605	No Felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and I feel what it must cost	186.04647827148438
2029/3605	No I am lost do not be lost with	103.84793853759766
2030/3605	My death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the	83.28384399414062
2031/3605	Be silent madame cried Felton and do not speak to me thus I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your	85.02115631103516
2032/3605	I will not promise said Milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have and if I make a promise I must keep	117.90833282470703
2033/3605	Well said Felton only promise till you have seen me	593.6121826171875
2034/3605	If when you have seen me again you still persistwell then you shall be free and I myself will give you the weapon you	103.7681884765625
2035/3605	Well said Milady for you I will	95.23112487792969
2036/3605	Are you satisfied   Well said Felton till	809.2384033203125
2037/3605	And he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldiers halfpike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his	63.163414001464844
2038/3605	The soldier returned and Felton gave him back his	1207.07275390625
2039/3605	Then through the grating to which she had drawn near Milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of	136.26141357421875
2040/3605	As for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of God by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know	348.8932189941406
2041/3605	My God said she what a senseless fanatic My God it is IIand this fellow who will help me to avenge	511.04437255859375
2042/3605	CAPTIVITY THE FIFTH DAY     Milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her	36900.08984375
2043/3605	It was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her	344.6512756347656
2044/3605	Milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the	281.8033752441406
2045/3605	But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of	601.95703125
2046/3605	Religion and its observances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary sed	19741.984375
2047/3605	There fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material lovethat sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with	1721.6153564453125
2048/3605	Milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and	266.9117126464844
2049/3605	In short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her	649.5056762695312
2050/3605	Many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of	265.01153564453125
2051/3605	Milady being well prepared for the reception of Felton was able to erect her batteries for the next	734.007568359375
2052/3605	To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of	222.4102020263672
2053/3605	Like all persons of real genius Milady knew what suited her nature and her	792.9141235351562
2054/3605	Poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her	688.839599609375

2056/3605	The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her	5931.96240234375
2057/3605	To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for	1641.57568359375
2058/3605	She should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last For an active ambitious nature like that of Milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious	615.1856689453125
2059/3605	For the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her	253.1672821044922
2060/3605	Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the	220.4893035888672

2062/3605	Time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the	180.0583038330078
2063/3605	At nine oclock Lord de Winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or Milady pronouncing a single	198.863037109375
2064/3605	Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless	641.2750854492188
2065/3605	Well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight   At ten oclock Felton came and placed the sent	97.33130645751953
2066/3605	She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet Milady at the same time detested and despised this weak	163.4648895263672
2067/3605	Two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was	546.6533203125
2068/3605	This time it _was_ the hour and from this moment Milady waited with impat	154.8251495361328

2070/3605	At the expiration of ten minutes Felton	526.4765625
2071/3605	Listen said the young man to the sent	40.72603988647461
2072/3605	On no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although I during his absence watched in his	234.2198486328125
2073/3605	Yes I know it said the	45.4085578918457
2074/3605	I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest	197.04319763183594
2075/3605	For my part I am going to pay a second visit to this woman who I fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and I have received orders to watch	127.7520751953125
2076/3605	Good murmured Milady the austere Puritan	1880.826904296875
2077/3605	As to the soldier he only	356.356201171875
2078/3605	Zounds Lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my Lord has authorized you to look into her	811.9340209960938
2079/3605	Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare	349.8141174316406
2080/3605	I promised to come said Felton and I have	420.4073181152344
2081/3605	What my God said the young man who in spite of his selfcommand felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his	62.13640213012695
2082/3605	You promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our	128.25209045410156
2083/3605	Say no more of that madame said Fel	722.3287963867188
2084/3605	There is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of God to inflict death upon	788.0250854492188
2085/3605	I have reflected and I cannot must not be guilty of such a	111.46549224853516
2086/3605	Ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and I also have	56.6377067565918
2087/3605	Upon what   That I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his	30.920698165893555
2088/3605	Here is the knife said Felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his	194.7928009033203
2089/3605	For what purpose   Upon my honor I will instantly return it to	62.21526336669922
2090/3605	You shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and	111.5546646118164
2091/3605	Felton offered the weapon to Milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her	196.95265197753906
2092/3605	Well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good	446.0174255371094
2093/3605	Felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the	119.80168151855469
2094/3605	Milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of	55.83177947998047
2095/3605	The young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour	441.45916748046875
2096/3605	Felton said Milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to	127.31173706054688
2097/3605	While yet young unfortunately handsome I was dragged into a sn	572.1504516601562
2098/3605	Ambushes and violences multiplied around me but I	49839.90234375
2099/3605	The religion I serve the God I adore were blasphemed because I called upon that religion and that God but still I	1001.8724365234375
2100/3605	Then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body	719.2283325195312
2101/3605	Finally   Milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her	69.24737548828125
2102/3605	Finally said Felton finally what did they do   At length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not	304.794677734375
2103/3605	One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my	1075.4132080078125
2104/3605	Scarcely had I finished my repast when I felt myself sink by degrees into a strange tor	168.12850952148438
2105/3605	Although I was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and I tried to struggle against sleep	584.940185546875
2106/3605	I wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their	127.95588684082031
2107/3605	It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its	287.2657165527344
2108/3605	I could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over	300.4720153808594
2109/3605	I supported myself by a chair feeling that I was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak	214.90269470214844
2110/3605	I fell upon one knee then upon	509.405517578125
2111/3605	I tried to pray but my tongue was	519.4444580078125
2112/3605	God doubtless neither heard nor saw me and I sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled	301.4193115234375
2113/3605	Of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted I have no	210.3104248046875
2114/3605	The only thing I recollect is that I awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the	227.62490844726562
2115/3605	No door gave entrance to the	425.8065490722656
2116/3605	It might be called a magnificent	329.6006164550781
2117/3605	It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in or to take account of the details I	92.82716369628906
2118/3605	My mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which I could not rouse	194.39816284179688
2119/3605	At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I believed myself	388.26922607421875
2120/3605	My clothes were near me on a chair I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to	454.6072692871094
2121/3605	Then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste ter	7752.34326171875
2122/3605	I was no longer in the house where I had dw	39.2587776184082
2123/3605	As well as I could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds	79.62137603759766
2124/3605	The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish	191.4457244873047
2125/3605	Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend Felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my	429.19366455078125
2126/3605	Yes it was a prison for I tried in vain to get out of	63.202430725097656
2127/3605	I sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat	369.94622802734375
2128/3605	I made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was	84.38631439208984
2129/3605	I sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an arm	217.27432250976562
2130/3605	Meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors	14152.287109375
2131/3605	I did not know but I had better remain where I was	63.186580657958984
2132/3605	It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every	257.2168884277344
2133/3605	Although I had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling	353.057373046875
2134/3605	No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me I only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of October and it was quite	106.3179702758789
2135/3605	All at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me	177.31723022460938
2136/3605	A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and I perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of	194.41595458984375
2137/3605	A table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the	215.6348876953125
2138/3605	That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding	159.41908264160156
2139/3605	Oh yes scoundrel cried Milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange rec	218.6146240234375
2140/3605	Oh yes scoundrel He believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was	534.333984375
2141/3605	He came hoping that I would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my	113.6750717163086
2142/3605	All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words I poured out upon this	127.17533874511719
2143/3605	Doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his	136.64535522460938
2144/3605	Then when he thought I had said all he advanced toward me I sprang toward the table I seized a knife I placed it to my	154.49844360351562
2145/3605	Take one step more said I and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself	145.14144897460938
2146/3605	There was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he	892.04931640625
2147/3605	Your death said he oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after I have had the happiness to possess you only a single	111.51010131835938
2148/3605	Adieu my charmer I will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better	294.16033935546875
2149/3605	At these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and	218.6372528076172
2150/3605	I found myself again in complete	342.40777587890625
2151/3605	The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and I was completely	658.7792358398438
2152/3605	This moment was frightful if I had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming	317.2958984375
2153/3605	I was in the power of a man whom I not only detested but despisedof a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to	73.67215728759766
2154/3605	But who then was this man asked Fel	3090.711669921875
2155/3605	I passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and I was again in	217.9154510498047
2156/3605	But the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecut	85.28577423095703
2157/3605	Day came the table had disappeared only I had still the knife in my	210.71334838867188
2158/3605	Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes I had not dared to sleep a single	542.1903686523438
2159/3605	The light of day reassured me I went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which I concealed under my	623.88232421875
2160/3605	When I awoke a fresh meal was	1392.9461669921875
2161/3605	This time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony I began to feel a devouring	666.2131958007812
2162/3605	It was fortyeight hours since I had taken any nour	85.97100067138672
2163/3605	I ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk I would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing	298.6512451171875
2164/3605	And yet notwithstanding these precautions I remained for some time in a terrible agitation of	193.29222106933594
2165/3605	But my fears were this time illfounded I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I	1061.2103271484375
2166/3605	I took the precaution to half empty the _carafe_ in order that my suspicions might not be	107.10039520263672
2167/3605	The evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to	362.6218566894531
2168/3605	I saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my	243.70973205566406
2169/3605	In an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more light	147.41563415527344
2170/3605	I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into	820.1318359375
2171/3605	Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank	825.7561645507812
2172/3605	At the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the	61.76555633544922
2173/3605	I paused but I had already drunk half a	133.3431396484375
2174/3605	I threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my	343.265380859375
2175/3605	No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly	299.9781188964844
2176/3605	I dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense I had leftmy saving knife but I could not reach the	787.6471557617188
2177/3605	I sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then I felt that I was	138.85989379882812
2178/3605	Felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole	153.6865997314453
2179/3605	It is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less fright	50.159149169921875
2180/3605	I saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then I heard the wellknown creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but	182.18417358398438
2181/3605	I felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the	424.4647521972656
2182/3605	I wished to make an effort I attempted to cry	88.77117919921875
2183/3605	By an incredible effort of will I even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecut	252.697998046875
2184/3605	Tell me who this man was cried the young	230.09776306152344
2185/3605	Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single p	379.6631164550781
2186/3605	The more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge	520.9193725585938
2187/3605	She continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to	69.43177032470703
2188/3605	Only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal	170.95361328125
2189/3605	I have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties I retained the sense of my	120.98380279541016
2190/3605	I felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my sw	782.1596069335938
2191/3605	Felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of	322.7254943847656
2192/3605	The sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his	200.22244262695312
2193/3605	My first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife I had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for exp	201.59007263183594
2194/3605	But on taking this knife Felton a terrible idea occurred to	681.6130981445312
2195/3605	I have sworn to tell you all and I will tell you	17.14187240600586
2196/3605	I have promised you the truth I will tell it were it to destroy	105.05252838134766
2197/3605	The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried Fel	304.5104064941406
2198/3605	The idea was not that of a Christian I knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my	696.7813110351562
2199/3605	In short what shall I say to you Felton continued Milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a	324.8992004394531
2200/3605	This idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the	339.52984619140625
2201/3605	Continue continue said Felton I am eager to see you attain your vengeance   Oh I resolved that it should take place as soon as	177.29220581054688
2202/3605	I had no doubt he would return the following	92.89903259277344
2203/3605	During the day I had nothing to	80.4135513305664
2204/3605	When the hour of breakfast came therefore I did not hesitate to eat and	229.6510772705078
2205/3605	I had determined to make believe sup but to eat	444.46270751953125
2206/3605	I was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the	178.63526916503906
2207/3605	Only I concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained fortyeight hours without eating or	216.4048614501953
2208/3605	The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution I had formed only I took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for I had no doubt I was	123.23106384277344
2209/3605	Several times even I felt a smile on my	236.2619171142578
2210/3605	Felton I dare not tell you at what idea I smiled you would hold me in horror   Go on go on said Felton you see plainly that I listen and that I am anxious to know the	117.69829559326172
2211/3605	Evening came the ordinary events took	1117.720703125
2212/3605	During the darkness as before my supper was	482.12347412109375
2213/3605	Then the lamp was lighted and I sat down to	100.35420227050781
2214/3605	I pretended to pour out water from the jug but I only drank that which I had saved in my	141.51071166992188

2281/3605	Milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful	672.4525146484375
2282/3605	But cried Felton that is a _fleurdelis_ which I see	1478.9195556640625
2283/3605	And therein consisted the infamy replied Mil	1625.959228515625

2290/3605	Felton was a Puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her	203.38363647460938
2291/3605	He no longer loved her he adored	155.5830535888672

2299/3605	The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal	155.33131408691406
2300/3605	But how can Lord de Winter my protector my father asked Felton possibly be mixed up with all this   Listen Felton resumed Milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous n	453.10577392578125

2305/3605	Yes yes said Felton I understand how he would	592.6836547851562
2306/3605	But with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poni	59.48432540893555
2307/3605	Buckingham had left England the day before sent as ambassador to Spain to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles	1362.883056640625

2310/3605	Yes said Milady Lord de Winter and now you can understand it all can you not Buckingham remained nearly a year	255.95814514160156

2312/3605	Whence came the blow God who knows all knows without doubt but as for me I accuse	651.4019775390625
2313/3605	Oh what an abyss what an abyss cried Fel	17153.57421875
2314/3605	Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his	323.9208068847656
2315/3605	The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the	127.8314208984375
2316/3605	Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless	736.5350952148438

2320/3605	Communication being closed by the war I was in want of	309.2194519042969
2321/3605	I was then obliged to come back	48.94419479370117
2322/3605	Six days ago I landed at	3524.422607421875
2323/3605	Well Buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my	301.6973876953125
2324/3605	He spoke of me to Lord de Winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded	528.924560546875
2325/3605	The noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend	120.58783721923828
2326/3605	Lord de Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe	84.37139129638672
2327/3605	He caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your	464.8689880371094
2328/3605	The day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the	556.6685791015625
2329/3605	Oh the train is well laid the plot is	1452.4371337890625
2330/3605	My honor will not survive it You see then Felton I can do nothing but	516.253173828125
2331/3605	No you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your	513.4285278320312
2332/3605	Milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but Felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a div	631.0359497070312
2333/3605	Oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame Felton my brother my friend I conjure you   No cried Felton no you shall live and you shall be aven	267.3483581542969

2335/3605	Several strokes resounded on the door this time Milady really pushed him away from	251.30601501464844
2336/3605	Hark said she we have been overheard Someone is coming All is over We are lost   No said Felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the	362.46923828125
2337/3605	Then run to the door and open it	142.5135955810547
2338/3605	Felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole	304.2038879394531
2339/3605	He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watchpat	2079.183349609375
2340/3605	Well what is the matter asked the young	48.74252700805664
2341/3605	You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the	101.53158569335938
2342/3605	I heard you cry out without understanding what you	271.0447692871094
2343/3605	I tried to open the door but it was locked inside then I called the	143.3679656982422
2344/3605	And here I am said the	99.457275390625
2345/3605	Felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speech	710.7435913085938
2346/3605	Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the	173.81439208984375
2347/3605	She ran to the table and seizing the knife which Felton had laid down exclaimed And by what right will you prevent me from dying   Great God exclaimed Felton on seeing the knife glitter in her	267.3487243652344
2348/3605	At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	84.07765197753906
2349/3605	The baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the	123.93563079833984
2350/3605	Ah said he here we are at the last act of the	66.96826171875
2351/3605	You see Felton the drama has gone through all the phases I named but be easy no blood will	2325.79736328125
2352/3605	Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate and terrible proof of her	1377.3114013671875
2353/3605	You are mistaken my Lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow   Felton uttered a cry and rushed toward	356.19464111328125
2354/3605	He was too late Milady had stabbed	206.4961395263672
2355/3605	But the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of	416.63671875
2356/3605	It had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the	559.9080810546875
2357/3605	Miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a	551.593017578125
2358/3605	Milady fell down and seemed to be in a sw	104.35614776611328
2359/3605	See my Lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself   Be at ease Felton said Lord de	111.8183364868164
2360/3605	She is not dead demons do not die so	691.61083984375
2361/3605	Be tranquil and go wait for me in my	279.9818115234375
2362/3605	But my Lord   Go sir I command you   At this injunction from his superior Felton obeyed but in going out he put the knife into his bos	155.4894561767578
2363/3605	As to Lord de Winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on Milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them	92.83065795898438
2364/3605	Meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a	403.7295837402344
2365/3605	ESCAPE     As Lord de Winter had thought Miladys wound was not	248.91436767578125
2366/3605	So soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her	51.62510681152344
2367/3605	It was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Mil	700.3401489257812
2368/3605	Thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all	514.5186767578125
2369/3605	But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from	189.66653442382812
2370/3605	There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced Felton was	1595.203857421875
2371/3605	If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the	127.5343017578125
2372/3605	Milady smiled at this thought for Felton was now her only hopeher only means of	1284.572509765625
2373/3605	But Lord de Winter might suspect him Felton himself might now be watched   Toward four oclock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time Milady stabbed herself however short the wound had	242.08026123046875
2374/3605	The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by Miladys pulse that the case was not	418.0131530761719
2375/3605	In the morning Milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended	206.4224090576172
2376/3605	She had one hope which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast hour but Felton did not	460.9958190917969
2377/3605	Were her fears realized Was Felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment She had only one day	1062.179931640625
2378/3605	Lord de Winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twenty	957.7056884765625
2379/3605	Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for	548.6364135742188
2380/3605	Although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual	108.15116119384766
2381/3605	Milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was	211.565185546875
2382/3605	Then she ventured to ask what had become of Fel	387.1003723144531
2383/3605	She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horse	52.282588958740234
2384/3605	She inquired if the baron was still at the	76.84088134765625
2385/3605	The soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to	45.87253189086914
2386/3605	Milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left	76.58306884765625
2387/3605	The soldier went out leaving the dinner	604.0087890625
2388/3605	This was the last blow to the	96.62564086914062
2389/3605	The bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of	196.1746826171875
2390/3605	She cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the gr	124.31524658203125
2391/3605	He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her	494.2646789550781
2392/3605	She was free now to give way to her transports without being	407.90118408203125
2393/3605	She traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron	319.3472900390625
2394/3605	_Certes_ if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the bar	301.8690490722656
2395/3605	At six oclock Lord de Winter came	61.21403503417969
2396/3605	This man in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jail	142.70126342773438
2397/3605	He appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate	474.88543701171875
2398/3605	A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	98.09809875488281
2399/3605	Ay said he I see but you shall not kill me	82.71409606933594
2400/3605	You have no longer a weapon and besides I am on my	81.73084259033203
2401/3605	You had begun to pervert my poor Fel	6694.07470703125
2402/3605	He was yielding to your infernal influence but I will save	222.68630981445312
2403/3605	He will never see you again all is	106.18036651611328
2404/3605	I had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will	464.7962951660156
2405/3605	Tomorrow by twelve oclock I shall have the order for your exile signed _Buckingham	813.395263671875
2406/3605	If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains	414.3744812011719
2407/3605	If when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the	153.13656616210938
2408/3605	_Au revoir_ then that is all I have to say	113.16079711914062
2409/3605	Tomorrow I will see you again to take my	72.94023895263672
2410/3605	With these words the baron went	53.667808532714844
2411/3605	Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her	602.8060913085938
2412/3605	Milady felt that she stood in need of all her	150.6436309814453
2413/3605	She did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a	266.42938232421875
2414/3605	Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her	918.9013061523438
2415/3605	The thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her	210.38253784179688
2416/3605	It appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their	683.7179565429688
2417/3605	She howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with	270.8122253417969
2418/3605	All at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the	125.88150024414062
2419/3605	She ran to the window and opened	27.757204055786133
2420/3605	Yes said Felton but silence silence I must have time to file through these	1339.54931640625
2421/3605	Only take care that I am not seen through the w	61.97380828857422
2422/3605	Oh it is a proof that the Lord is on our side Felton replied Mil	289.99652099609375
2423/3605	They have closed up the grating with a	376.5119323730469
2424/3605	That is well God has made them senseless said Fel	2777.1953125
2425/3605	But what must I do asked Mil	291.9701232910156
2426/3605	Go to bed or at least lie down in your	447.477294921875
2427/3605	As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes of	65.80950164794922
2428/3605	But will you be able to follow me   Oh yes   Your wound   Gives me pain but will not prevent my	116.2472915649414
2429/3605	Be ready then at the first	125.7784194946289
2430/3605	Milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as Felton had desired her to lie down on the	409.371337890625
2431/3605	Amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the pan	296.1554870605469
2432/3605	She passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the	176.8372039794922
2433/3605	There are hours which last a	1569.85107421875
2434/3605	At the expiration of an hour Felton tapped	1233.61474609375
2435/3605	Milady sprang out of bed and opened the	138.3143768310547
2436/3605	Two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass	320.009765625
2437/3605	Must I take anything with me   Money if you have	73.99179077148438
2438/3605	Yes fortunately they have left me all I	105.86742401123047
2439/3605	So much the better for I have expended all mine in chartering a	619.5472412109375
2440/3605	Here said Milady placing a bag full of louis in Feltons	674.998779296875
2441/3605	Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the	35.22299575805664
2442/3605	Now said he will you come   I am	39.77492141723633
2443/3605	Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the	82.81896209716797
2444/3605	She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of	151.26596069335938
2445/3605	For the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a	122.30619049072266
2446/3605	I will descend with my eyes	182.80470275878906
2447/3605	Have you confidence in me said Fel	2128.46435546875
2448/3605	You ask that   Put your two hands	152.28561401367188
2449/3605	Cross them thats right   Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handker	173.98770141601562
2450/3605	What are you doing asked Milady with	168.1914520263672
2451/3605	Pass your arms around my neck and fear	265.560546875
2452/3605	But I shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to	118.32523345947266
2453/3605	Not a second was to be	140.04110717773438
2454/3605	Milady passed her two arms round Feltons neck and let herself slip out of the	551.630615234375
2455/3605	Felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by	359.5382080078125
2456/3605	Despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the	233.71536254882812
2457/3605	We are discovered   There was a silence of several	107.79395294189453
2458/3605	But what then is the noise   That of the patrol going their	161.35336303710938
2459/3605	Where is their road   Just under	189.23281860351562
2460/3605	They will discover us   No if it does not light	167.2279052734375
2461/3605	But they will run against the bottom of the	81.48867797851562
2462/3605	Fortunately it is too short by six	205.90757751464844
2463/3605	Here they are My God   Silence   Both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and	164.23060607910156
2464/3605	This was a terrible moment for the fug	53.54414367675781
2465/3605	The noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died	171.1964569091797
2466/3605	Milady breathed a deep sigh and f	169.32730102539062
2467/3605	Near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the	98.22598266601562
2468/3605	He stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his	123.32576751708984
2469/3605	Then he took Milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had	106.71000671386719
2470/3605	He soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whist	116.34626770019531
2471/3605	A similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four	155.2623748779297
2472/3605	The boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch	408.42864990234375
2473/3605	Felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to	571.8956298828125
2474/3605	Fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was	886.8301391601562
2475/3605	The little boat bounded over the waves like a	1304.33251953125
2476/3605	To the sloop said Felton and row	2354.674560546875
2477/3605	The four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of	146.92391967773438
2478/3605	However they left the castle behind that was the principal	271.2439880371094
2479/3605	It was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the	66.08153533935547
2480/3605	A black point floated on the	773.9932250976562
2481/3605	While the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it Felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Miladys hands	389.2597351074219
2482/3605	When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her	454.270751953125
2483/3605	Milady breathed a sigh and opened her	185.89385986328125
2484/3605	Yes there is the sky here is the sea The air I breathe is the air of liberty Ah thanks Felton thanks   The young man pressed her to his	223.24417114257812
2485/3605	But what is the matter with my hands asked Milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a	92.12599182128906
2486/3605	Milady held out her arms her wrists were	1595.1331787109375
2487/3605	Alas said Felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrow	416.6430969238281
2488/3605	Milady looked around her as if in search of	105.34024810791016
2489/3605	It is there said Felton touching the bag of money with his	726.7985229492188
2490/3605	A sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat	1458.4556884765625
2491/3605	The one I have hired for	145.81968688964844
2492/3605	Where will it take me   Where you please after you have put me on shore at	225.76876831054688
2493/3605	What are you going to do at Portsmouth asked Mil	335.0649719238281
2494/3605	Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter said Felton with a gloomy	309.4955749511719
2495/3605	As he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your	326.6449279785156
2496/3605	But if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you   How could I know what I was the bearer of   Thats true And you are going to Portsmouth   I have no time to	37.21726989746094
2497/3605	Tomorrow is the twentythird and Buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his	39398.72265625
2498/3605	He sets sail tomorrow Where for   For La Roc	706.3164672851562
2499/3605	He need not sail cried Milady forgetting her usual presence of	600.036376953125
2500/3605	Be satisfied replied Felton he will not	2698.7041015625
2501/3605	She could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of Buckingham was written there at full	72.97550964355469
2502/3605	Felton cried she you are as great as Judas Maccabeus If you die I will die with you that is all I can say to	306.58245849609375
2503/3605	Felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to Milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much	225.19676208496094
2504/3605	An instant after they were on the	97.11438751220703
2505/3605	Captain said Felton this is the person of whom I spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to	177.8389129638672
2506/3605	For a thousand pistoles said the	46.604427337646484
2507/3605	I have paid you five hundred of	83.72710418701172
2508/3605	And here are the other five hundred replied Milady placing her hand upon the bag of	169.78855895996094
2509/3605	No said the captain I make but one bargain and I have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at Boulog	75.21377563476562
2510/3605	And shall we arrive there   Safe and sound as true as my names Jack	6472.13232421875
2511/3605	Well said Milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred I will give you a thousand pist	50.44108963012695
2512/3605	Hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship   Meanwhile said Felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in	664.609619140625
2513/3605	The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been	176.56741333007812
2514/3605	On her side Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than	692.3324584960938
2515/3605	It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten oclock if he did not return by ten oclock she was to	155.6597900390625
2516/3605	In that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in France at the convent of the Carmelites at Béth	84.54420471191406
2517/3605	WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23 1628     Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her	13516.2666015625
2518/3605	As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward Milady who standing on the deck followed him with her	65.4366683959961
2519/3605	Both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into Miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to	200.62075805664062
2520/3605	Felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted Milady a last time and took his course toward the	731.8267822265625
2521/3605	At the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sl	51.100120544433594
2522/3605	He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and	465.9021911621094
2523/3605	Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter bent with each breath of the	222.4123077392578
2524/3605	Felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James	1551.5772705078125
2525/3605	furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Pur	387.2463684082031
2526/3605	This was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an	608.0231323242188
2527/3605	He entered Portsmouth about eight oclock in the	168.54165649414062
2528/3605	The whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the port the troops about to embark were marching toward the	337.9764404296875
2529/3605	Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty covered with dust and streaming with pers	201.2337646484375
2530/3605	His countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and	941.47412109375
2531/3605	The sentinel wanted to repulse him but Felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said A pressing message from Lord de	193.05906677246094
2532/3605	At the name of Lord de Winter who was known to be one of his Graces most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let Felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval	227.23709106445312
2533/3605	At the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his forekne	408.2356872558594
2534/3605	Felton and he addressed Patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same	397.7348327636719
2535/3605	Felton named Lord de Winter the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself	135.11354064941406
2536/3605	Each was anxious to gain admission before the	274.3252868652344
2537/3605	Patrick who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his	105.17852783203125
2538/3605	The other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the	175.9512481689453
2539/3605	Lieutenant Felton from Lord de Winter said	6677.05126953125
2540/3605	From Lord de Winter repeated Buckingham let him come	154.24501037597656
2541/3605	At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pear	132.22113037109375
2542/3605	Why didnt the baron come himself demanded	1669.234130859375
2543/3605	He desired me to tell your Grace replied Felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the	396.94647216796875
2544/3605	Yes I know that said Buckingham he has a	111.33992004394531
2545/3605	It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace replied Fel	969.975341796875
2546/3605	Well then speak   That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my Lord   Leave us Patrick said Buckingham but remain within sound of the	362.63812255859375
2547/3605	We are alone sir said Buckingham speak   My Lord said Felton the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Back	435.19354248046875
2548/3605	Yes sir and I answered him to bring or send me that order and I would sign	121.61714935302734
2549/3605	Give it to me said the d	24.39896011352539
2550/3605	And taking it from Felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign	66.5427474975586
2551/3605	Pardon my Lord said Felton stopping the duke but does your Grace know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this young woman   Yes sir I know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the	239.430419921875
2552/3605	Then your Grace knows her real name asked Felton in a sharp	5442.15087890625
2553/3605	I know it and the duke put the quill to the	63.55508041381836
2554/3605	And knowing that real name my Lord replied Felton will you sign it all the same   Doubtless said Buckingham and rather twice than	453.9842529296875
2555/3605	I cannot believe continued Felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this	871.849609375
2556/3605	I know it perfectly although I am astonished that you know	69.028076171875
2557/3605	And will your Grace sign that order without remorse   Buckingham looked at the young man haught	454.3129577636719
2558/3605	Do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that I am very foolish to answer them   Reply to them my Lord said Felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps	332.7430725097656
2559/3605	Buckingham reflected that the young man coming from Lord de Winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and	637.0150756835938
2560/3605	The baron knows as well as myself that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to	980.8729858398438
2561/3605	The duke put his pen to the	73.889892578125
2562/3605	You will not sign that order my Lord said Felton making a step toward the d	439.5456237792969
2563/3605	I will not sign this order And why not   Because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the	69.8105239868164
2564/3605	I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn said	820.63134765625
2565/3605	My Lord Milady de Winter is an angel you know that she is and I demand her liberty of	131.03993225097656
2566/3605	Bah Are you mad to talk to me thus said	226.78504943847656
2567/3605	My Lord excuse me I speak as I can I restrain	197.34304809570312
2568/3605	But my Lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too far   What do you say God pardon me cried Buckingham I really think he threatens me   No my Lord I still	102.08724212646484
2569/3605	And I say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many	1334.4554443359375
2570/3605	Felton said Buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under	486.5375061035156
2571/3605	You will hear me to the end my	87.82678985595703
2572/3605	You have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled	1289.530029296875
2573/3605	Repair your crimes toward her let her go free and I will exact nothing else from	376.6232604980469
2574/3605	You will exact said Buckingham looking at Felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced	803.7767333984375
2575/3605	My Lord continued Felton becoming more excited as he spoke my Lord beware All England is tired of your iniquities my Lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped my Lord you are held in horror by God and	1160.9915771484375
2576/3605	God will punish you hereafter but I will punish you here   Ah this is too much cried Buckingham making a step toward the	140.75201416015625
2577/3605	I ask it humbly of you my Lord said he sign the order for the liberation of Milady de	236.10537719726562
2578/3605	Remember that she is a woman whom you have dishon	64.94458770751953
2579/3605	Withdraw sir said Buckingham or I will call my attendant and have you placed in ir	488.3460693359375
2580/3605	You shall not call said Felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with	293.55194091796875
2581/3605	Beware my Lord you are in the hands of God   In the hands of the devil you mean cried Buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely	137.7666015625
2582/3605	Sign my Lord sign the liberation of Milady de Winter said Felton holding out a paper to the d	620.937255859375
2583/3605	By force You are joking Holloa Patrick   Sign my Lord  	2043.1114501953125
2584/3605	Never   Help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his	44.431846618652344
2585/3605	But Felton did not give him time to draw	117.2709732055664
2586/3605	He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the d	104.07156372070312
2587/3605	At that moment Patrick entered the room crying A letter from France my	1452.6905517578125
2588/3605	From France cried Buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter	2011.9959716796875
2589/3605	Felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the	92.77543640136719
2590/3605	Ah traitor cried Buckingham you have killed me   Murder screamed	1729.5135498046875
2591/3605	Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes	70.02175903320312
2592/3605	At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick the man whom Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the	194.56202697753906
2593/3605	He found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the	64.14331817626953
2594/3605	Laporte said the duke in a dying voice Laporte do you come from her   Yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of Austria but too late	61.754661560058594
2595/3605	Oh I cannot tell what she says to me My God I am dying   And the duke swoon	73.63082122802734
2596/3605	Meanwhile Lord de Winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of Buckinghams household had all made their way into the	172.62278747558594
2597/3605	Cries of despair resounded on all	108.14342498779297
2598/3605	The news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the	401.7423400878906
2599/3605	The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken	322.54425048828125
2600/3605	He recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all	877.1279296875
2601/3605	Gentlemen said he leave me alone with Patrick and Laporteah is that you De Winter You sent me a strange madman this morning See the state in which he has put	475.4017333984375
2602/3605	Oh my Lord cried the baron I shall never console	89.96739959716797
2603/3605	And you would be quite wrong my dear De Winter said Buckingham holding out his hand to	99.20670318603516
2604/3605	I do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us I pray	100.10075378417969
2605/3605	There only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and	264.7538757324219
2606/3605	A physician was sought for but none was yet	874.01708984375
2607/3605	You will live my Lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of Anne of Austria on his knees before the dukes	133.1793212890625
2608/3605	What has she written to me said Buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me Read me her	456.1215515136719
2609/3605	Obey Laporte do you not see I have no time to lose   Laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the	64.80704498291016
2610/3605	Read said he read I cannot	116.89546966552734
2611/3605	Read then For soon perhaps I shall not hear and I shall die without knowing what she has written to	114.94923400878906
2612/3605	This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France but misfortune upon you my Lord for which I should never console	233.26544189453125
2613/3605	Be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear     to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in	98.70329284667969
2614/3605	And is that allis that all replied Buckingham impatient	766.0875244140625
2615/3605	She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved	89.52409362792969
2616/3605	Ah said Buckingham God be praised My death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger   Laporte burst into	124.23602294921875
2617/3605	Patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were	104.52432250976562
2618/3605	Patrick brought the object desired which Laporte recognized as having belonged to the	193.71682739257812
2619/3605	Now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pear	554.8580322265625
2620/3605	Here Laporte said Buckingham these are the only tokens I ever received from herthis silver casket and these two	379.2344665527344
2621/3605	And you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of Laport	79.62081146240234
2622/3605	Buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of	656.9500122070312
2623/3605	At this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admirals ship where they had been obliged to seek	184.6473388671875
2624/3605	He approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall All is useless said he he is	112.27290344238281
2625/3605	At this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and	142.1905517578125
2626/3605	As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead he ran to Felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the	341.0157775878906
2627/3605	Wretch said he to the young man who since the death of Buckingham had regained that coolness and selfpossession which never after abandoned him wretch what have you done   I have avenged myself said	89.34539794921875
2628/3605	Rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but I swear to you that this crime shall be her	70.72927856445312
2629/3605	I dont know what you mean replied Felton quietly and I am ignorant of whom you are speaking my	156.1671905517578
2630/3605	I killed the Duke of Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain I have punished him for his injustice that is	261.4795837402344
2631/3605	De Winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound Felton and could not tell what to think of such insens	348.5486755371094
2632/3605	One thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of Fel	1341.59619140625
2633/3605	At every noise he heard the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with	116.83879852294922
2634/3605	His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he	78.06587219238281
2635/3605	With the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of	176.22044372558594
2636/3605	He grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treacher	155.61473083496094
2637/3605	One last favor my Lord said he to the bar	129.76182556152344
2638/3605	What oclock is it   The baron drew out his	38.640625
2639/3605	It wants ten minutes to nine said	235.85479736328125
2640/3605	Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a	118.83168029785156
2641/3605	As soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be	202.18240356445312
2642/3605	The vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the	240.91006469726562
2643/3605	God has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his	171.92904663085938
2644/3605	De Winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed	585.4725952148438
2645/3605	Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syll	218.06866455078125
2646/3605	As to Lord de Winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the	57.48933792114258
2647/3605	IN FRANCE     The first fear of the King of England Charles	454.52294921875
2648/3605	He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England the ambassadors of Denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of Holland who was to take back to the port of Flushing the Indian merchantmen of which Charles	435.14251708984375
2649/3605	had made restitution to the United Provin	21560.591796875
2650/3605	As to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set	705.3084716796875
2651/3605	During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of	244.28460693359375
2652/3605	Germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musket	111.16755676269531
2653/3605	The cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of	303.75164794921875
2654/3605	The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after	76.61729431152344
2655/3605	de Tréville for they were the first to whom he communicated	56.72132873535156
2656/3605	It was then that DArtagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left	96.36975860595703
2657/3605	It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had for a cause the danger which M	336.89581298828125
2658/3605	Bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of Béthune with Milady her mortal	407.0528869628906
2659/3605	Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for M	983.4468994140625
2660/3605	Bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into Lorraine or	380.14752197265625
2661/3605	They had not long to wait for an	160.37451171875
2662/3605	Eight or ten days afterward Aramis received the following letter   MY DEAR COUSIN Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of Béthune the air of which you think is bad for	1607.5579833984375
2663/3605	My sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable	771.94287109375
2664/3605	There was no further question therefore about Marie Michon among the four Musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw M	253.2528839111328
2665/3605	Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of Béth	131.55914306640625
2666/3605	It was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at La Rochelle that is to say at the other end of	65.04583740234375
2667/3605	Therefore DArtagnan was going to ask leave of absence of	34.89191436767578
2668/3605	The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the six	93.1370849609375
2669/3605	The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgères to Mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of	1495.2041015625
2670/3605	Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heart	645.7926635742188
2671/3605	DArtagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which Porthos explained thus A very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you	231.4058074951172
2672/3605	At length the escort passed through Paris on the twentythird in the	631.2117309570312
2673/3605	de Tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the Bast	388.8480529785156
2674/3605	The first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four	1322.794677734375
2675/3605	de Tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nightsfor they set out on the twentyfourth at five oclock in the evening and as a further kindness	269.0185852050781
2676/3605	de Tréville postdated the leave to the morning of the twenty	4129.54296875
2677/3605	Good Lord said DArtagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at	129.10232543945312
2678/3605	It appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple	53.429039001464844
2679/3605	In two days and by using up two or three horses thats nothing I have plenty of money I am at Béth	285.7838439941406
2680/3605	I present my letter from the queen to the superior and I bring back the dear treasure I go to seeknot into Lorraine not into Belgium but to Paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at La Roc	262.1363525390625
2681/3605	Well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we	214.58689880371094
2682/3605	Remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless	644.2115478515625
2683/3605	Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition	184.84588623046875
2684/3605	To this Athos replied quietly We also have money leftfor I have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and Porthos and Aramis have not eaten all	118.36422729492188
2685/3605	We can therefore use up four horses as well as	342.56488037109375
2686/3605	But consider DArtagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that Béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with	238.76107788085938
2687/3605	If you had only to deal with four men DArtagnan I would allow you to go	36.40433883666992
2688/3605	You have to do with that woman We four will go and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient	139.33314514160156
2689/3605	My God what do you fear   Everything replied Ath	42.53001022338867
2690/3605	DArtagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of Athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another	70.20459747314453
2691/3605	DArtagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass	43.16162109375
2692/3605	What is the matter monsieur said Planc	8.896355628967285
2693/3605	Oh come gentlemen my master is ill   The three friends hastened toward DArtagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his	66.6239242553711
2694/3605	Well where the devil are you going now cried Ath	59.35529708862305
2695/3605	It is he cried DArtagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he let me overtake him   He What he asked Ath	46.433292388916016

2698/3605	Well eagerly demanded all his three	462.9703063964844

2708/3605	According to the desire of your Eminence I report to the convent of the Carmelites at Béthune where I will await your	167.00851440429688
2709/3605	Accordingly that same evening Milady commenced her	583.5934448242188
2710/3605	Night overtook her she stopped and slept at an	235.94781494140625
2711/3605	At five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered Béth	227.34906005859375
2712/3605	She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites and went thither	107.71488189697266
2713/3605	The superior met her Milady showed her the cardinals	317.59698486328125
2714/3605	The abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast	1222.195556640625
2715/3605	The evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and	1149.2216796875
2716/3605	After breakfast the abbess came to pay her a	173.40940856933594
2717/3605	There is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new board	519.0923461914062
2718/3605	This was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she	136.58197021484375
2719/3605	She tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole	909.0679931640625
2720/3605	Milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six	130.91259765625
2721/3605	But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a	115.15804290771484
2722/3605	Milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the	758.3756103515625
2723/3605	She did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle	318.78619384765625
2724/3605	But the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his Emin	291.40679931640625
2725/3605	Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act	245.87661743164062
2726/3605	Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with M	400.7287292480469
2727/3605	dAiguillon Marion de Lorme and several other gay	5727.65185546875
2728/3605	The abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and	764.7050170898438
2729/3605	Good thought Milady she takes a pleasure in my	357.5740661621094
2730/3605	If she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at	630.6353149414062
2731/3605	She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his	109.18119812011719
2732/3605	The abbess only crossed herself without approving or disappro	4400.1455078125
2733/3605	This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinal	426.38885498046875
2734/3605	Milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and	8633.15234375
2735/3605	I am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have	222.75990295410156
2736/3605	And one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal   One of your boarders said Milady oh my God Poor woman I pity her	414.2328186035156
2737/3605	And you have reason for she is much to be pit	112.19417572021484
2738/3605	Imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered	11723.5419921875
2739/3605	But after all resumed the abbess Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the	314.85986328125
2740/3605	Good said Milady to herself who knows I am about perhaps to discover something here I am in the	138.47262573242188
2741/3605	She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect cand	68.94744110107422
2742/3605	Alas said Milady I know it is	113.68038177490234
2743/3605	You would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent   The cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain	233.92308044433594
2744/3605	Permit me madame to express my surprise said the abb	157.125
2745/3605	At what said Milady with the utmost ingenuous	297.25732421875
2746/3605	What do you find so astonishing in that language said Milady	199.33859252929688
2747/3605	You are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet   And yet I speak ill of him replied Milady finishing the thought of the	102.32551574707031
2748/3605	At least you dont speak well of	262.60662841796875
2749/3605	Ah said Milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether	141.3070068359375
2750/3605	Then said the abbess looking at Milady with increasing interest I behold another poor victim   Alas yes said Mil	273.357421875
2751/3605	The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her	116.14045715332031
2752/3605	You are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitating	90.5127944946289
2753/3605	You will find here moreover the young woman of whom I spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court	245.50807189941406
2754/3605	What is her name   She was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of	83.4972915649414
2755/3605	I have not tried to discover her other	123.93367004394531
2756/3605	What Are you sure   That she is called so Yes mad	63.95845031738281
2757/3605	Do you know her   Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chamber	95.44123840332031
2758/3605	There was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of Milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to	168.1488800048828
2759/3605	And when can I see this young lady for whom I already feel so great a sympathy asked Mil	199.8439483642578
2760/3605	Why this evening said the abbess today	135.36325073242188
2761/3605	But you have been traveling these four days as you told me	130.7445831298828
2762/3605	This morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of rep	124.82674407958984
2763/3605	Go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse	237.440673828125
2764/3605	Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the	496.41851806640625
2765/3605	During the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required rep	348.0500793457031
2766/3605	She therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought to her	162.1739959716797
2767/3605	She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her	220.361083984375
2768/3605	All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady so rocked by them she soon fell	538.1192626953125
2769/3605	She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her	63.085330963134766
2770/3605	She opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent	112.94447326660156
2771/3605	The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to	53.05849838256836
2772/3605	Each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of	776.1571655273438
2773/3605	Milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic	383.4693603515625
2774/3605	It is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this	233.8732147216797
2775/3605	The abbess introduced them to each	303.4668884277344
2776/3605	When this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women	423.0079345703125
2777/3605	The novice seeing Milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but Milady stopped	235.78317260742188
2778/3605	Well said Milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening This awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bed	195.74234008789062
2779/3605	How unfortunate I am said she I have been here six months without the shadow of	133.21177673339844
2780/3605	You arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet I expect in all probability to quit the convent at any	202.58328247070312
2781/3605	How you are going soon asked Mil	567.1854858398438
2782/3605	At least I hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to	115.3379135131836
2783/3605	I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued Milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between	182.49134826660156
2784/3605	What I have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked	199.71038818359375
2785/3605	Hush said Milady let us not even here speak thus of	227.20858764648438
2786/3605	All my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom I thought my friend and who betrayed	97.59942626953125
2787/3605	Are you also the victim of a treachery   No said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman I loved for whom I would have laid down my life for whom I would give it	93.29024505615234
2788/3605	But you madame you appear to be free continued the novice and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do	171.69882202148438
2789/3605	Hear me said the novice we must trust in	1211.504150390625
2790/3605	Oh when I said I was alone said Milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the	312.7867431640625
2791/3605	The queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible	181.70448303222656
2792/3605	I have proof that her Majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons who had served	243.60446166992188
2793/3605	Trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in	298.6959533691406
2794/3605	The more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind	400.4861145019531
2795/3605	Alas said Milady I believe so the queen is so good   Oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with	219.01487731933594
2796/3605	That is to say replied Milady driven into her entrenchment that I have not the honor of knowing her personally but I know a great number of her most intimate	126.46678161621094
2797/3605	I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange I met Monsieur Dujart in England I know Monsieur de Tré	95.67498779296875
2798/3605	Monsieur de Tréville exclaimed the novice do you know Monsieur de Tréville   Yes perfectly wellintimately	127.21992492675781
2799/3605	The captain of the kings Musketeers   The captain of the kings Musket	40.564762115478516
2800/3605	Why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost	676.6220092773438
2801/3605	If you know Monsieur de Tréville you must have visited him   Often said Milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the	81.6053695678711
2802/3605	With him then you must have seen some of his Musketeers   All those he is in the habit of receiving replied Milady for whom this conversation began to have a real	100.91502380371094
2803/3605	Name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my	42.4821891784668
2804/3605	Well said Milady embarrassed I know Monsieur de Louvigny Monsieur de Courtivron Monsieur de Feruss	256.39007568359375
2805/3605	What is the matter Good God asked the poor woman have I said anything that has wounded you   No but the name struck me because I also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him	92.4873046875
2806/3605	Oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends Messieurs Porthos and Aramis   Indeed you know them likewise I know them cried Milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her	142.82264709472656
2807/3605	Well if you know them you know that they are good and free	100.9117431640625
2808/3605	Why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help   That is to say stammered Milady I am not really very intimate with any of	64.24577331542969
2809/3605	I know them from having heard one of their friends Monsieur dArtagnan say a great deal about	47.94175338745117
2810/3605	You know Monsieur dArtagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her	51.91240310668945
2811/3605	Then remarking the strange expression of Miladys countenance she said Pardon me madame you know him by what title   Why replied Milady embarrassed why by the title of	103.6199951171875
2812/3605	You deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress   It is you who have been his mistress madame cried Milady in her	100.96150970458984
2813/3605	You are Madame Bonacieux   The young woman drew back filled with surprise and	60.01102066040039
2814/3605	Oh do not deny it Answer continued Mil	363.259765625
2815/3605	Well yes madame said the novice Are we rivals   The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances M	358.2049865722656
2816/3605	Bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by	136.9711456298828
2817/3605	Bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed	89.39906311035156
2818/3605	Have you been or are you his mistress   Oh no cried Milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her	152.28961181640625
2819/3605	Never never   I believe you said M	228.2351837158203
2820/3605	Bonacieux but why then did you cry out so   Do you not understand said Milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of	98.5837631225586
2821/3605	How can I understand I know	95.66500091552734
2822/3605	Can you not understand that Monsieur dArtagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence   Truly   Do you not perceive that I know allyour abduction from the little house at	93.1223373413086
2823/3605	Bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted	181.8274688720703
2824/3605	Oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of Mil	156.2352752685547
2825/3605	Pardon me I love him so much   These two women held each other for an instant in a close	78.2007064819336
2826/3605	Certainly if Miladys strength had been equal to her hatred M	702.587158203125
2827/3605	Bonacieux would never have left that embrace	237.0949249267578
2828/3605	But not being able to stifle her she smiled upon	92.40677642822266
2829/3605	Oh you beautiful good little creature said Mil	1214.7059326171875
2830/3605	How delighted I am to have found you Let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her	231.10916137695312
2831/3605	Oh yes it is you indeed From what he has told me I know you	85.94480895996094
2832/3605	The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and	408.496826171875
2833/3605	Then you know what I have suffered said M	248.77920532226562
2834/3605	Bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is	82.0033187866211
2835/3605	Milady replied mechanically Yes that is	1744.614990234375
2836/3605	Bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a	178.7409210205078
2837/3605	Tomorrow this evening perhaps I shall see him again and then the past will no longer	68.5190200805664
2838/3605	This evening asked Milady roused from her reverie by these	263.57586669921875
2839/3605	What do you mean Do you expect news from him   I expect	57.59648513793945
2840/3605	Himself DArtagnan here   Himself   But thats impossible He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the	83.59789276123047
2841/3605	He will not return till after the taking of the	192.0687713623047
2842/3605	Ah you fancy so But is there anything impossible for my DArtagnan the noble and loyal gentleman   Oh I cannot believe you   Well read then said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to Mil	98.6834716796875
2843/3605	The writing of Madame de Chevreuse said Milady to	57.569908142089844
2844/3605	Ah I always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter And she greedily read the following few lines   MY DEAR CHILD Hold yourself	4484.111328125
2845/3605	_Our friend_ will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be	249.17027282714844
2846/3605	Prepare then for your departure and never despair of	350.607666015625
2847/3605	Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful     as	188.9597930908203
2848/3605	Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning     he has	254.72061157226562
2849/3605	Yes yes said Milady the letter is	240.24539184570312
2850/3605	Do you know what that warning was   No I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the	360.6123352050781
2851/3605	Yes thats it no doubt said Milady returning the letter to M	331.95166015625
2852/3605	Bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bos	84.26231384277344
2853/3605	At that moment they heard the gallop of a	102.8177490234375
2854/3605	Bonacieux darting to the window can it be he   Milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a	116.02244567871094
2855/3605	He he murmured she can it be he And she remained in bed with her eyes	95.37145233154297
2856/3605	Bonacieux it is a man I dont know although he seems to be coming	52.93958282470703
2857/3605	Yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he	8285.2412109375

2872/3605	Milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the	80.06930541992188
2873/3605	An instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man	120.43865966796875
2874/3605	Milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the Comte de Rochefortthe demoniacal tool of his Emin	344.276611328125

2878/3605	Ah said Rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chanceone that will delight his Eminence Have you informed him of it   I wrote to him from Boulog	71.59420776367188

2884/3605	Then she looks upon you as a stranger   Milady	117.18634796142578
2885/3605	Upon my honor said Rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles   And it is well I can Chevalier said Milady for do you know what is going on here  	58.12726974487305

2889/3605	Why is it not done already   What would you The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I cannot	105.76081848144531
2890/3605	The devil Whats to be done   What did the cardinal say about me   I was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to	123.5721206665039
2891/3605	I must then remain here   Here or in the	57.04951477050781
2892/3605	You cannot take me with you   No the order is	81.62019348144531
2893/3605	Near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the	200.3144073486328

2895/3605	Observe it is probable that I may not be able to remain	35.20811080932617

2921/3605	And you say you will wait for me at Armentières   At Armentiè	54.880859375
2922/3605	Write that name on a bit of paper lest I should forget	198.48184204101562
2923/3605	There is nothing compromising in the name of a	142.6252899169922
2924/3605	Is it not so   Eh who knows Never mind said Milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper I will compromise	201.54940795898438
2925/3605	Well said Rochefort taking the paper from Milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be	205.975830078125

2927/3605	Now is that all   I believe	58.76017761230469
2928/3605	Is that all then   In truth my dear Chevalier you are a miracle of	55.62437438964844
2929/3605	_A propos_ add one thing   What   I saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent	518.6791381835938

2931/3605	Who knows Perhaps I shall stand in need of a back door for	584.1747436523438
2932/3605	What   To ask me if I want	41.259498596191406

2936/3605	And you go   In an hourtime to eat a morsel during which I shall send for a post	138.1140899658203
2937/3605	Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and	246.24176025390625
2938/3605	An hour afterward Rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through Ar	173.67430114746094
2939/3605	Our readers already know how he was recognized by DArtagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given fresh activity to their	362.8389587402344
2940/3605	THE DROP OF WATER     Rochefort had scarcely departed when M	10760.4873046875
2941/3605	She found Milady with a smiling count	212.16346740722656
2942/3605	Well said the young woman what you dreaded has	197.0413055419922
2943/3605	This evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you	145.10650634765625
2944/3605	Who told you that my dear asked Mil	162.1337890625
2945/3605	I heard it from the mouth of the messenger	83.85679626464844
2946/3605	Come and sit down close to me said Mil	157.1310577392578
2947/3605	Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears	411.2243347167969
2948/3605	Why all these precautions   You shall	38.27037048339844
2949/3605	Milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to M	174.11277770996094
2950/3605	Then said she he has well played his	409.1966857910156
2951/3605	Who has   He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the	84.6020736694336
2952/3605	It was then a part he was playing   Yes my	110.4043197631836
2953/3605	That man then was not   That man said Milady lowering her voice is my	131.0240020751953
2954/3605	No one must know this secret my dear but	275.8677978515625
2955/3605	If you reveal it to anyone in the world I shall be lost and perhaps yourself	128.41578674316406
2956/3605	This is what has happened My brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of	68.88445281982422
2957/3605	At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the	86.43692779541016
2958/3605	The messenger resisted my brother killed	1846.7198486328125
2959/3605	Then my brother determined to substitute cunning for	4514.064453125
2960/3605	He took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his Emin	59.635986328125
2961/3605	It is your brother who sends this	308.45587158203125
2962/3605	That letter you have received and which you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse   Well   It is a for	36.01872634887695
2963/3605	How can that be   Yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch	95.65834045410156
2964/3605	But it is DArtagnan that will	29.102001190185547
2965/3605	DArtagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of La Roc	27.359874725341797
2966/3605	How do you know that   My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of Musket	51.0134391784668
2967/3605	You would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to	149.05421447753906
2968/3605	Oh my God My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniqu	9013.671875
2969/3605	I feel if this continues said M	1227.0692138671875
2970/3605	Bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead I shall go mad   Stop   What   I hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off	107.85379791259766
2971/3605	I should like to offer him a last	97.83780670166016
2972/3605	Come   Milady opened the window and made a sign to M	57.40370559692383
2973/3605	The chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to Mil	104.97671508789062
2974/3605	The good George said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and	128.60231018066406
2975/3605	And she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely	843.0053100585938
2976/3605	Bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do Good heaven You have more experience than I	114.82279968261719
2977/3605	In the first place said Milady it is possible I may be deceived and that DArtagnan and his friends may really come to your	55.5443000793457
2978/3605	Oh that would be too much cried M	464.0386962890625
2979/3605	Bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me   Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive	70.92134094238281
2980/3605	If your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are	160.49354553222656
2981/3605	Oh yes yes lost beyond redemption What then to do What to do   There would be a very simple means very natural   Tell me what   To wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for	151.66384887695312
2982/3605	But where can I wait   Oh there is no difficulty in	42.8026237487793
2983/3605	I shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin	190.14764404296875
2984/3605	Well I take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait	281.52294921875
2985/3605	But I shall not be allowed to go I am almost a	46.94673156738281
2986/3605	As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow	90.74166107177734
2987/3605	But DArtagnan DArtagnan if he comes   Shall we not know it   How   Nothing	24.270112991333008
2988/3605	We will send my brothers servant back to Béthune whom as I told you we can	598.429931640625
2989/3605	He shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the	155.33502197265625
2990/3605	If the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is Monsieur dArtagnan and his friends he will bring them to	26.81593894958496
2991/3605	He knows them then   Doubt	32.4326286315918
2992/3605	Has he not seen Monsieur dArtagnan at my house   Oh yes yes you are	21.98054313659668
2993/3605	Thus all may go wellall may be for the best but we do not go far from this place   Seven or eight leagues at the	140.3079376220703
2994/3605	We will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave	133.7704620361328
2995/3605	And what can we do there  	67.58222961425781
2996/3605	But if they come   My brothers carriage will be here	128.44976806640625
2997/3605	If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for youat dinner or supper for instance   Do one	166.91896057128906
2998/3605	What is that   Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my rep	110.3503189086914
2999/3605	Will she permit it   What inconvenience can it be   Oh delightful In this way we shall not be separated for an	143.17538452148438
3000/3605	Well go down to her then to make your	157.68212890625
3001/3605	I feel my head a little confused I will take a turn in the	91.69505310058594
3002/3605	Go and where shall I find you   Here in an	64.77407836914062
3003/3605	Now then all is agreed let us go	265.8236999511719
3004/3605	You are going into the garden  	25.71627426147461
3005/3605	Go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in	125.97174835205078
3006/3605	Excellent thank you   And the two women parted exchanging charming	273.57025146484375
3007/3605	Milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed one another like	4068.60009765625
3008/3605	She required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into	133.1483917236328
3009/3605	She saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular	407.2957763671875
3010/3605	What was most pressing was to get M	2011.118408203125
3011/3605	Bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a	312.8310241699219
3012/3605	Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did	314.3612060546875
3013/3605	Besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near and could not fail to be	271.6497802734375
3014/3605	The principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep M	383.0660400390625
3015/3605	Bonacieux was the very life of DArtagn	16.837108612060547
3016/3605	This was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good	224.99969482421875
3017/3605	Once concealed with her at Armentières it would be easy to make her believe that DArtagnan had not come to Béth	89.6899185180664
3018/3605	In fifteen days at most Rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four	184.55384826660156
3019/3605	She would not be weary thank God for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her characterperfecting a beautiful	543.0322875976562
3020/3605	Revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her	107.07997131347656
3021/3605	Milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a	293.0821228027344
3022/3605	At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was M	233.064208984375
3023/3605	The good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup	387.6729736328125
3024/3605	On reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the	48.83027267456055
3025/3605	It is the one my brother sends for	288.7707824707031
3026/3605	Oh my God   Come come courage   The bell of the convent gate was sounded Milady was not	168.9862823486328
3027/3605	Go to your chamber said she to M	765.1693115234375
3028/3605	Bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to	86.44529724121094
3029/3605	Well go and fetch them and come to my	109.77522277832031
3030/3605	We will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength	423.1101989746094
3031/3605	Bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so I cannot	89.39249420166016
3032/3605	Courage courage remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for _his_	115.72293090820312
3033/3605	You have restored my courage by a single word go I will rejoin	115.49955749511719
3034/3605	Milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found Rocheforts lackey and gave him his	268.49560546875
3035/3605	He was to wait at the gate if by chance the Musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the	71.11959075927734
3036/3605	In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on	222.35272216796875
3037/3605	As we have already said Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of	90.36591339111328
3038/3605	If the Musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed M	286.5760192871094
3039/3605	Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away M	74.10209655761719
3040/3605	Bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any Milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her	114.97528076171875
3041/3605	Milady asked some questions about the	465.3635559082031
3042/3605	It was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion Rocheforts lackey would precede it as	1672.736083984375
3043/3605	Milady was wrong in fearing that M	802.1762084960938
3044/3605	You see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is	91.42768096923828
3045/3605	The abbess suspects nothing and believes that I am taken by order of the	426.9978332519531
3046/3605	This man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be	261.4472961425781
3047/3605	Bonacieux mechanically yes let us be	115.53706359863281
3048/3605	Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of Spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a	229.8177032470703
3049/3605	See said she if everything does not second us Here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we	206.9248046875
3050/3605	Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her	106.19505310058594
3051/3605	Come come said Milady lifting hers to her mouth do as I	535.4930419921875
3052/3605	But at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gall	112.15592956542969
3053/3605	Then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of	71.86441802978516
3054/3605	This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while M	233.82293701171875
3055/3605	Bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid	221.07012939453125
3056/3605	Nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw	274.5184326171875
3057/3605	Bonacieux what is that noise   That of either our friends or our enemies said Milady with her terrible cool	111.60617065429688
3058/3605	Stay where you are I will tell	36.07606887817383
3059/3605	Bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a	70.63053131103516
3060/3605	The noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces	69.688232421875
3061/3605	If they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an	111.3488998413086
3062/3605	The noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoof	119.89237213134766
3063/3605	Milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was	124.4192123413086
3064/3605	All at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horse	440.7236328125
3065/3605	One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his	177.68081665039062
3066/3605	In the first horseman she recognized DArtagn	48.57553482055664
3067/3605	Oh my God my God cried M	736.898681640625
3068/3605	Bonacieux what is it   It is the uniform of the cardinals	67.55384063720703
3069/3605	Not an instant to be lost Fly fly   Yes yes let us fly repeated M	896.1635131835938
3070/3605	Bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by	125.3782958984375
3071/3605	They heard the horsemen pass under the	272.6097412109375
3072/3605	Come then come then cried Milady trying to drag the young woman along by the	309.4280090332031
3073/3605	Thanks to the garden we yet can flee I have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late   M	186.45803833007812
3074/3605	Bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her	110.39984130859375
3075/3605	Milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do	260.8601379394531
3076/3605	At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the Musketeers set off at a gall	35.5516471862793
3077/3605	Then three or four shots were	48.22541809082031
3078/3605	For the last time will you come cried Mil	289.01361083984375
3079/3605	Oh my God my God you see my strength fails me you see plainly I cannot	184.25462341308594
3080/3605	Flee alone   Flee alone and leave you here No no never cried Mil	334.4015808105469
3081/3605	All at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into M	393.34765625
3082/3605	Bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quick	124.4957046508789
3083/3605	It was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved	384.1014709472656
3084/3605	Then taking the glass with a firm hand she said	256.6388854980469
3085/3605	This wine will give you strength drink And she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank	146.93463134765625
3086/3605	This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself said Milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith we do what we can And she rushed out of the	109.94673156738281
3087/3605	Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to	122.88715362548828
3088/3605	A few moments passed a great noise was heard at the	72.22688293457031
3089/3605	Bonacieux expected to see Milady but she did not	95.43113708496094
3090/3605	Several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning	219.3837432861328
3091/3605	At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the	85.7935562133789
3092/3605	There was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name	144.59800720214844
3093/3605	All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of DArtagn	34.69342803955078
3094/3605	Bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of	66.89301300048828
3095/3605	DArtagnan threw down a yetsmoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his	88.5733871459961
3096/3605	Athos replaced his in his belt Porthos and Aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabb	95.22740173339844
3097/3605	Oh DArtagnan my beloved DArtagnan You have come then at last You have not deceived me It is indeed thee   Yes yes Const	76.766357421875

3099/3605	Oh I have done well How happy I am   At this word _she_ Athos who had seated himself quietly started	111.23660278320312
3100/3605	She who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecut	110.41716766357422
3101/3605	She who mistaking you for the cardinals Guards has just fled	692.0023803710938
3102/3605	Your companion cried DArtagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his	59.35102462768555
3103/3605	Of what companion are you speaking dear Constance   Of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend of a woman to whom you have told	124.73904418945312
3104/3605	My God can you not remember her name   Yes it was pronounced in my hearing	119.67601013183594
3105/3605	Stopbutit is very strangeoh my God my head swims I cannot see   Help help my friends her hands are icy cold cried DArtagn	201.7648162841797
3106/3605	Oh said Athos oh no it is impossible God would not permit such a crime   Water water cried DArtagn	132.50823974609375
3107/3605	Water   Oh poor woman poor woman murmured Athos in a broken	105.9478759765625
3108/3605	Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of DArtagn	25.787105560302734
3109/3605	Oh my God my God I thank thee   Madame said Athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this   Mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying	53.50853729248047
3110/3605	But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass  	170.39230346679688
3111/3605	But who is _she_   Oh I remember said M	232.7034149169922
3112/3605	The four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of Athos dominated all the	265.45977783203125
3113/3605	At that moment the countenance of M	205.0111541748047
3114/3605	Bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos and Aram	49.93061065673828
3115/3605	DArtagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be	58.34206008911133
3116/3605	And what do you believe His voice was stifled by so	207.093017578125
3117/3605	I believe everything said Athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sigh	154.82301330566406
3118/3605	Bonacieux where art thou Do not leave me You see I am dying   DArtagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to	47.77180099487305
3119/3605	Her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her	309.8581237792969
3120/3605	In the name of heaven run call Aramis Porthos Call for help   Useless said Athos useless For the poison which _she_ pours there is no	360.68060302734375
3121/3605	Bonacieux help   Then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to	72.37139892578125
3122/3605	A sigh escaped from the mouth of M	477.1397705078125
3123/3605	Bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of DArtagn	20.19220733642578
3124/3605	That sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to	1016.8240356445312
3125/3605	DArtagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his	36.14902877807617
3126/3605	The young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as	88.83655548095703
3127/3605	Porthos wept Aramis pointed toward heaven Athos made the sign of the	96.96173858642578
3128/3605	At that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the	95.27055358886719
3129/3605	He looked around him and saw M	322.9066467285156
3130/3605	Bonacieux dead and DArtagnan in a sw	34.04954147338867
3131/3605	He appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrop	109.13893127441406
3132/3605	I was not deceived said he here is Monsieur dArtagnan and you are his friends Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aram	20.98390007019043
3133/3605	The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with aston	125.141357421875
3134/3605	It seemed to all three that they knew	155.81982421875
3135/3605	Gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as I am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for I see a	97.97913360595703
3136/3605	The three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what	245.88600158691406
3137/3605	Gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice I must name	241.75436401367188
3138/3605	I am Lord de Winter brotherinlaw of that _woman	147.35548400878906
3139/3605	The three friends uttered a cry of	49.307987213134766
3140/3605	Athos rose and offering him his hand Be welcome my Lord said he you are one of	217.56546020507812
3141/3605	I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth said Lord de	436.9066467285156
3142/3605	I arrived three hours after her at Boulog	72.4095458984375
3143/3605	I missed her by twenty minutes at	658.5744018554688
3144/3605	Finally at Lilliers I lost all trace of	935.0419921875
3145/3605	I was going about at random inquiring of everybody when I saw you gallop	274.9783935546875
3146/3605	I called to you but you did not answer me I wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with	58.867393493652344
3147/3605	And yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too	152.91546630859375
3148/3605	You see said Athos pointing to M	163.02117919921875
3149/3605	Bonacieux dead and to DArtagnan whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to	32.57260513305664
3150/3605	Are they both dead asked Lord de Winter stern	318.6737060546875
3151/3605	No replied Athos fortunately Monsieur dArtagnan has only f	25.80895233154297
3152/3605	Ah indeed so much the better said Lord de	37.95515823364258
3153/3605	At that moment DArtagnan opened his	22.769123077392578
3154/3605	He tore himself from the arms of Porthos and Aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his	25.97144317626953
3155/3605	Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis to go and fetch the	53.62675094604492
3156/3605	The two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five	565.7756958007812
3157/3605	Madame said Athos passing his arm under that of DArtagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate	113.17401885986328
3158/3605	She was an angel on earth before being an angel in	271.39874267578125
3159/3605	Treat her as one of your	286.86614990234375
3160/3605	We will return someday to pray over her	6368.365234375
3161/3605	DArtagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos and sobbed	32.471527099609375
3162/3605	Weep said Athos weep heart full of love youth and life Alas would I could weep like you   And he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered	171.10186767578125
3163/3605	All five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of Béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came	254.0460662841797
3164/3605	But said DArtagnan shall we not pursue that woman   Later said Ath	61.06704330444336
3165/3605	She will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault Ath	66.95648193359375
3166/3605	I will be accountable for her said Ath	141.39846801757812
3167/3605	DArtagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without	41.812347412109375
3168/3605	Porthos and Aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of Ath	70.06460571289062
3169/3605	Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of DArtagn	82.84186553955078
3170/3605	Now gentlemen said Athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own	219.31858825683594
3171/3605	DArtagnan needs to be alone to weep and to	70.6988296508789
3172/3605	I take charge of everything be	175.18299865722656
3173/3605	It appears however said Lord de Winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sisterin	87.07029724121094
3174/3605	And me said Athos she is my wife   DArtagnan smiledfor he understood that Athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a	48.095767974853516
3175/3605	Porthos and Aramis looked at each other and grew	15.783040046691895
3176/3605	Lord de Winter thought Athos was	124.28543853759766
3177/3605	Now retire to your chambers said Athos and leave me to	151.8715362548828
3178/3605	You must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns	149.15048217773438
3179/3605	Only DArtagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that mans hat upon which is written the name of the village of   Ah said DArtagnan I comprehend that name written in her	51.08481216430664
3180/3605	THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK     The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary	4537.39697265625
3181/3605	Planchet Grimaud Bazin and Mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from Ath	175.05264282226562
3182/3605	They must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to Armentièreseach by a different	261.20703125
3183/3605	Planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by Rocheforts	121.18732452392578
3184/3605	Athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential	176.88148498535156
3185/3605	Then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address	1173.9176025390625

3189/3605	Athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hô	73.77213287353516
3190/3605	At ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequ	116.44306945800781
3191/3605	Athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a	224.1863250732422
3192/3605	At length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to	292.4352111816406
3193/3605	The man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the Musketeer by	144.4749755859375
3194/3605	Athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man	147.87953186035156
3195/3605	Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly	376.65252685546875
3196/3605	Nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood	404.7843933105469
3197/3605	In a few minutes a night watch	204.85235595703125
3198/3605	Athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he	120.08736419677734
3199/3605	The night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany Athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to	110.81434631347656
3200/3605	Athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered	95.17106628417969
3201/3605	There he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third	161.0191650390625
3202/3605	Fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to Athos to ask charity Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was	162.76609802246094
3203/3605	The mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before Ath	67.73980712890625
3204/3605	Arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and	140.2806396484375
3205/3605	Athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry	76.64247131347656
3206/3605	Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was	118.4659194946289
3207/3605	No light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was	158.531494140625
3208/3605	It was dark and silent as the	159.9907684326172
3209/3605	Three times Athos knocked without receiving an	459.5560607910156
3210/3605	At the third knock however steps were heard	1202.8702392578125
3211/3605	The door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and	165.73382568359375
3212/3605	Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come	43.71340560913086
3213/3605	Athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind	83.48757934570312
3214/3605	The man whom Athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a	145.5058135986328
3215/3605	All the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the	368.5062561035156

3217/3605	There was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this	809.7567749023438
3218/3605	Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near	149.95008850097656
3219/3605	Then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of	79.0464096069336
3220/3605	But scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the Musketeer drew back with signs of terror and	126.5514144897461
3221/3605	Then Athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repug	94.38209533691406
3222/3605	The tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to	106.4450454711914
3223/3605	He arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the hôtel and went to his	130.095947265625
3224/3605	At daybreak DArtagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be	39.207054138183594
3225/3605	Some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the Musketeers that the burial would take place at	199.02906799316406
3226/3605	As to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found	78.89635467529297
3227/3605	As to the key it had	103.959716796875
3228/3605	At the hour appointed Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was	188.92086791992188
3229/3605	In the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was	551.56982421875
3230/3605	At the door of the chapel DArtagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for Athos but Athos had	88.06800842285156
3231/3605	Then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the	113.274658203125
3232/3605	Athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the	222.39524841308594
3233/3605	At the end of threequarters of a league within fifty paces of Festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by	493.91009521484375
3234/3605	Between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden the carriage had stopped	234.75149536132812
3235/3605	At this spot Milady had come out of the wood and entered the	64.75762176513672
3236/3605	Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions Athos returned to the hôtel and found Planchet impatiently waiting for	132.76502990722656
3237/3605	Planchet had followed the road like Athos he had discovered the stains of blood like Athos he had noted the spot where the horses had	129.51913452148438
3238/3605	The accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the	303.2215270996094
3239/3605	The man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her	498.8065490722656
3240/3605	Planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found	303.5609436035156
3241/3605	He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles and from Fromelles she had set out for Armentiè	296.13543701171875
3242/3605	Planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at Armentiè	33.183746337890625
3243/3605	There was but one tavern the	1841.06982421875
3244/3605	Planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a	62.044979095458984
3245/3605	Planchet had no need to learn	54.4560546875
3246/3605	He hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find Athos who had just received this information when his friends	108.8294677734375
3247/3605	All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of Aram	200.99534606933594
3248/3605	What is to be done asked DArtagn	12.169740676879883
3249/3605	At eight oclock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the	102.33332061767578
3250/3605	In an instant all five were	521.091796875
3251/3605	Each examined his arms and put them in	105.71240997314453
3252/3605	Athos came down last and found DArtagnan already on horseback and growing	185.53335571289062
3253/3605	Patience cried Athos one of our party is still	120.47169494628906
3254/3605	The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could	119.9481201171875
3255/3605	At this moment Planchet brought out Athoss horse the Musketeer leaped lightly into the	61.090721130371094
3256/3605	Wait for me cried he I will soon be back and he set off at a gall	56.7747688293457
3257/3605	In a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red	70.0761947631836
3258/3605	Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another inquiring	56.575843811035156
3259/3605	Neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of Ath	116.74127960205078
3260/3605	At nine oclock guided by Planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had	226.0476531982422
3261/3605	It was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastis	1177.2677001953125
3262/3605	TRIAL     It was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till	233.59034729003906
3263/3605	Occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in	226.4615020751953
3264/3605	Every minute Athos was forced to restrain DArtagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed	87.64104461669922
3265/3605	He had but one thoughtto go forward and he	376.6827087402344
3266/3605	They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of Riche	1420.0775146484375
3267/3605	At Herlier Planchet who led the column turned to the	200.07908630371094
3268/3605	Several times Lord de Winter Porthos or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without	156.1584014892578
3269/3605	The travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to	199.85157775878906
3270/3605	The storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horse	585.7286376953125
3271/3605	A little before they came to Fromelles the storm	886.9227294921875
3272/3605	There remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of	710.1193237304688
3273/3605	DArtagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his	25.937896728515625
3274/3605	He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudd	543.0726928710938
3275/3605	The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his	227.72023010253906
3276/3605	Has she left Armentières   Grimaud made a sign in the	66.7473373413086
3277/3605	I have charged myself with this	116.04513549804688
3278/3605	It is for me then to interrogate Grim	97.09068298339844
3279/3605	Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the	91.16355895996094
3280/3605	Grimaud showed his master his forefinger	604.4063720703125
3281/3605	Gentlemen said Athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the	97.46240997314453
3282/3605	Grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the caval	949.98779296875
3283/3605	At the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they for	541.3726806640625
3284/3605	By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquin	1808.6304931640625
3285/3605	Grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a	128.15487670898438
3286/3605	At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards	91.99991607666016
3287/3605	He pointed his finger to the lighted	196.16851806640625
3288/3605	While I watched the window he guarded the	262.0498962402344
3289/3605	Athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to Grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the	37.1683464050293
3290/3605	The little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet	258.48883056640625
3291/3605	Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the halfcurtains closely	137.35218811035156
3292/3605	He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the	1426.309326171875
3293/3605	By the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying	147.75843811035156
3294/3605	Her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as	521.8825073242188
3295/3605	He could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of Ath	45.01487350463867
3296/3605	He was not deceived it was she whom he	144.43075561523438
3297/3605	Milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos and	173.3653564453125
3298/3605	Athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and	96.69547271728516
3299/3605	The squares were broken to shivers and Athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the	164.27227783203125
3300/3605	Milady rushed to the door and opened	57.20972442626953
3301/3605	More pale and menacing than Athos DArtagnan stood on the	51.21696090698242
3302/3605	DArtagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but Athos raised his	82.12823486328125

3319/3605	And DArtagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aram	12.469639778137207
3320/3605	Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of	180.96871948242188

3348/3605	That woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is	160.4725799560547
3349/3605	She was a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Temple	3292.3212890625

3370/3605	Milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her	143.3827362060547
3371/3605	Athos stretched out his hand toward	56.9941520690918

3374/3605	At these words which left no hope Milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed	152.62744140625
3375/3605	She felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags	335.8684387207031
3376/3605	She did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the	303.01141357421875

3379/3605	In front of them the Lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the	442.6279602050781

3392/3605	On the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady and bound her hands and	205.309326171875
3393/3605	Then she broke the silence to cry out You are cowards miserable assassinsten men combined to murder one	2559.905029296875

3404/3605	Why did you not accept it   Because I am not willing to die cried Milady	72.26653289794922
3405/3605	Because I am too young to die   The woman you poisoned at Béthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said DArtagn	106.49981689453125

3408/3605	Milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her	76.51864624023438

3412/3605	DArtagnan was the youngest of all these	28.250885009765625
3413/3605	Oh I cannot behold this frightful spectacle said	234.39559936523438

3421/3605	I pardon you said he the ill you have done	110.27588653564453

3428/3605	I pardon you and I weep for	87.95877075195312
3429/3605	Die in peace   I am lost murmured Milady in	93.20181274414062
3430/3605	I must die   Then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of	226.1219482421875
3431/3605	She saw nothing she listened and she heard	202.92137145996094
3432/3605	Where am I to die said	109.68130493164062
3433/3605	On the other bank replied the execution	190.45753479003906
3434/3605	Then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself Athos handed him a sum of	77.91923522949219
3435/3605	Here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as	139.30238342285156
3436/3605	That is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that I am not fulfilling my trade but my	136.76327514648438
3437/3605	And he threw the money into the	89.25708770751953
3438/3605	The boat moved off toward the lefthand shore of the Lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the righthand bank where they fell on their	157.93023681640625
3439/3605	The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that	130.81716918945312
3440/3605	The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the redtinted	825.532958984375
3441/3605	Milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her	304.8045654296875
3442/3605	On coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to	240.71485900878906
3443/3605	But the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her	153.21493530273438
3444/3605	She was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasp	165.9941864013672
3445/3605	Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large	430.1400146484375
3446/3605	The two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the	355.7580261230469
3447/3605	The executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat	185.77210998535156
3448/3605	In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice Let the justice of God be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over	147.49545288085938
3449/3605	Three days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to	157.28407287597656
3450/3605	Well gentlemen said the brave captain I hope you have been well amused during your exc	213.67286682128906
3451/3605	Prodigiously replied Athos in the name of himself and his	78.68411254882812
3452/3605	CONCLUSION     On the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of Buckinghams	134.10313415527344
3453/3605	arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the	139.97128295898438
3454/3605	The joy of the king was	304.24652099609375
3455/3605	He did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the	440.8907470703125
3456/3605	like every weak mind was wanting in	735.420166015625
3457/3605	But the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain	290.0404968261719
3458/3605	He felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did	739.8141479492188
3459/3605	The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to	1496.849853515625
3460/3605	The return to La Rochelle therefore was profoundly	730.7615356445312
3461/3605	Our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads	846.0308227539062
3462/3605	Athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into rever	135.19454956054688
3463/3605	Holloa Monsieur dArtagnan said he is not that you whom I see yonder   DArtagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of	21.796459197998047
3464/3605	It was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of Meung of the Rue des Fossoyeurs and of Ar	234.41883850097656
3465/3605	DArtagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the	14.792403221130371
3466/3605	But this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet DArtagn	72.17345428466797
3467/3605	Ah monsieur said the young man I meet you then at last This time you shall not escape me   Neither is it my intention monsieur for this time I was seeking you in the name of the king I arrest	33.50925827026367

3476/3605	The Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that Porthos and Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four	39.360408782958984
3477/3605	Gentlemen said he if Monsieur dArtagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours I shall be satisfied with your promise to convey Monsieur dArtagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur the	49.25215530395508

3479/3605	This suits me the better said Rochefort as I wish to continue my	88.49861907958984
3480/3605	If it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady said Athos coolly it is useless you will not find	95.70884704589844

3483/3605	Rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a days journey from Surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with	149.84451293945312
3484/3605	Besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his	404.32550048828125
3485/3605	On the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at Surgè	104.26412963867188

3488/3605	On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied DArtagnan without his sword and the three Musketeers	150.43753051757812
3489/3605	This time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for DArtagnan to follow	49.375267028808594
3490/3605	We shall wait for you DArtagnan said Athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear	34.960533142089844
3491/3605	His Eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single	90.0018081665039
3492/3605	DArtagnan entered after the cardinal and behind DArtagnan the door was	26.420345306396484
3493/3605	His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musket	87.59517669677734
3494/3605	DArtagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with Richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his	77.5761947631836
3495/3605	Richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and DArtagn	48.960235595703125
3496/3605	Monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my	30.896881103515625
