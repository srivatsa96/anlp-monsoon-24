71/3605	As we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with	66.4783935546875
72/3605	He was Des Roches le Masle canon of Notre Dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his Eminence as a perfectly devout	1397.779296875
73/3605	The cardinal trusted him and therein found his	3743.5224609375
74/3605	There are many stories related of him and among them	442.0782775878906
75/3605	After a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to expiate at least for some time the follies of	375.23651123046875
76/3605	On entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with	253.172119140625
77/3605	At the denunciating sound the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother and all the community would go to	4277.908203125
78/3605	This advice appeared good to the future	3307.300537109375

81/3605	In proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent	1362.802490234375

84/3605	It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible _possessed_ that ever	145.05697631835938

87/3605	Has not his Majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit   Search then monsieur I am a criminal as it	220.0950927734375
88/3605	Estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my	582.685546875
89/3605	For forms sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that	167.0413360595703
90/3605	When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experienceit became necessary I say to come to the conclusion of the affair that is to say to search the queen	283.278076171875
91/3605	The chancellor advanced therefore toward Anne of Austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air And now it remains for me to make the principal	336.41693115234375
92/3605	What is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to	65.08086395263672
93/3605	His majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day he knows that it has not yet been sent to its	97.77326202392578

100/3605	Then give me that letter madame said the	96.5058822631836
101/3605	I will give it to none but the king monsieur said	30.431867599487305
102/3605	If the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you	71.69738006591797
103/3605	But I repeat to you I am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up   Well   He has then charged me to take it from	74.28826141357422

107/3605	I will not suffer it No no I would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to	142.1226348876953
108/3605	The queen was as we have said of great	200.9117889404297
109/3605	The commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of Buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone	294.5321350097656
110/3605	Without doubt the chancellor Séguier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell but not finding it he summoned his resolution and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be	179.5765838623047
111/3605	There monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious	101.40351867675781
112/3605	The chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and	196.26058959960938
113/3605	The door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her	112.76785278320312
114/3605	The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of	115.247802734375
115/3605	The king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of Spain he read it	143.8782501220703
116/3605	It was nothing but a plan of attack against the	121.77627563476562
117/3605	The king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the Louvre he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty in the business	334.46649169921875
118/3605	There Duke said he you were right and I was	199.7649688720703
119/3605	The whole intrigue is political and there is not the least question of love in this letter but on the other hand there is abundant question of	218.7610321044922
120/3605	The cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention then when he had arrived at the end of it he read it a second	44.86065673828125
121/3605	Well your Majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss	552.2172241210938
122/3605	In your place in truth sire I should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public	177.4127960205078
123/3605	What say you Duke   I say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these neverending lab	1354.151611328125
124/3605	You would be the happier for it at home sire and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it	120.93974304199219
125/3605	Monsieur Duke said the king I understand	82.03699493408203
126/3605	Be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen	285.6564636230469
127/3605	That is true Monsieur Cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my	177.75318908691406
128/3605	It is you sire who have now incurred	331.92236328125
129/3605	The queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable	162.45587158203125
130/3605	Allow me then sire to intercede for her with your	531.9798583984375
131/3605	Let her humble herself then and come to me	300.7803649902344
132/3605	On the contrary sire set the	482.3566589355469
133/3605	You have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the	224.72467041015625
134/3605	What I make the first advances said the	74.40357971191406
135/3605	Never   Sire I entreat you to do	12.90132999420166
136/3605	Besides in what manner can I make advances first   By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to	208.0856475830078
137/3605	What is that   Give a ball you know how much the queen loves	200.10829162597656
138/3605	I will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an	450.6100769042969
139/3605	Monsieur Cardinal you know that I do not like worldly	327.74688720703125
140/3605	Sire said the cardinal leave severity to your	665.8858032226562
141/3605	Clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage	1099.3682861328125
142/3605	Thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the	229.01016235351562
143/3605	Anne of Austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with	413.00152587890625
144/3605	Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to	710.3655395507812
145/3605	The king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fê	216.70359802246094
146/3605	A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her count	150.38021850585938
147/3605	She asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that	359.9976501464844
148/3605	Indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing	257.81524658203125
149/3605	On the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these lines I have them but I am unable to leave London for want of	194.18350219726562
150/3605	Send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after I have received them I shall be in	39.22397232055664
151/3605	On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to	185.1770782470703
152/3605	Richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself She will arrive she says four or five days after having received the	204.95103454589844
153/3605	It will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return that makes ten	185.19906616210938
154/3605	Now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a womans weakness there are twelve	3868.470458984375
155/3605	Well Monsieur Duke said the king have you made your calculations   Yes s	69.8770980834961
156/3605	The aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of	872.7481079101562
157/3605	That will fall in wonderfully well you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the	167.2798309326172
158/3605	Then the cardinal added _A propos_ sire do not forget to tell her Majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become	296.4974365234375
159/3605	BONACIEUX AT HOME     It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the	1199.9984130859375
160/3605	was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some	1643.4500732421875
161/3605	More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own	382.91937255859375
162/3605	He went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded	226.27725219726562
163/3605	Anne of Austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself but this was not what Louis	389.701171875
164/3605	wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was so skillful in getting	362.5328369140625
165/3605	He arrived at this end by his persistence in	2155.008544921875
166/3605	But cried Anne of Austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your	115.20621490478516
167/3605	What have I done then Let me know what crime I have	98.14021301269531
168/3605	It is impossible that your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my	602.6610107421875
169/3605	The king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fê	115.90422821044922
170/3605	Madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the Hôtel de V	65.22570037841797
171/3605	I wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which I gave you on your	669.3056640625
172/3605	Anne of Austria believed that Louis	868.651123046875
173/3605	knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was	370.57513427734375
174/3605	She became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a _console_ which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syll	326.70831298828125
175/3605	You hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the	225.38723754882812
176/3605	You hear madame   Yes sire I hear stammered the	38.01504898071289
177/3605	You will appear at this ball  	49.8309440612793
178/3605	The queens paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his	267.5156555175781
179/3605	Then that is agreed said the king and that is all I had to say to	43.86284255981445
180/3605	But on what day will this ball take place asked Anne of	186.95187377929688
181/3605	felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying	137.7620086669922
182/3605	Oh very shortly madame said he but I do not precisely recollect the date of the	80.9808578491211
183/3605	Then you will appear   Yes s	25.514503479003906
184/3605	That is well said the king retiring that is well I count upon	204.1932830810547
185/3605	The queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under	3563.3701171875
186/3605	I am lost murmured the queen lostfor the cardinal knows all and it is he who urges on the king who as yet knows nothing but will soon know	202.60104370117188
187/3605	I am lost My God my God my God   She knelt upon a cushion and prayed with her head buried between her palpitating	160.9602813720703
188/3605	More closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed	237.53646850585938
189/3605	Laporte could not leave the Louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could conf	81.44000244140625
190/3605	Thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and	611.7514038085938
191/3605	Can I be of service to your Majesty said all at once a voice full of sweetness and	359.6891174316406
192/3605	The queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke	322.5097961425781
193/3605	In fact at one of the doors which opened into the queens apartment appeared the pretty M	467.7689514160156
194/3605	She had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard	193.1491241455078
195/3605	The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprisedfor in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laport	134.42913818359375
196/3605	You oh heaven you cried the queen but look me in the	312.7133483886719
197/3605	Can I trust in you   Oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul I am ready to die for your Majesty   This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking	77.83251953125
198/3605	Bonacieux yes there are traitors here but by the holy name of the Virgin I swear that no one is more devoted to your Majesty than I	143.66195678710938
199/3605	Bonacieux we must have them back	76.75112915039062
200/3605	Yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am I to act How can it be effected   Someone must be sent to the d	124.93524169921875
201/3605	But who who In whom can I trust   Place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and I will find a	204.31678771972656
202/3605	Two words from the hand of your Majesty and your private	640.0311279296875
203/3605	But these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile   Yes if they fell into infamous	548.402587890625
204/3605	But I will answer for these two words being delivered to their	145.2642059326172
205/3605	Oh my God I must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands   Yes yes madame you must and I will save them	73.84734344482422
206/3605	But how Tell me at least the	279.2962951660156
207/3605	My husband had been at liberty these two or three	64.5213394165039
208/3605	I have not yet had time to see him	27.880395889282227
209/3605	He is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for	284.8193054199219
210/3605	He will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your Majestys letter without even knowing it is from your Majesty to the address which is on	362.97479248046875
211/3605	The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tender	163.58457946777344
212/3605	Do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor   Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your	70.08057403564453
213/3605	I have nothing to save for your Majesty you are only the victim of perfidious	418.5854187011719
214/3605	That is true that is true my child said the queen you are	41.70186996459961
215/3605	Give me then that letter madame time	2810.442626953125
216/3605	The queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and	556.2198486328125
217/3605	She wrote two lines sealed the letter with her private seal and gave it to M	1721.97412109375
218/3605	And now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary	177.4163360595703
219/3605	What is that madame  	45.09266662597656
220/3605	Yes that is true said she and I will confess to your Majesty that my husband   Your husband has	84.74948120117188
221/3605	Is that what you would say   He has some but he is very avaricious that is his	82.88750457763672
222/3605	Nevertheless let not your Majesty be uneasy we will find	850.3486938476562
223/3605	And I have none either said the	93.2320785522461
224/3605	Those who have read the _Memoirs_ of M	2218.064208984375
225/3605	de Motteville will not be astonished at this	323.5128173828125
226/3605	Anne of Austria ran to her jewel	913.0025024414062
227/3605	Here said she here is a ring of great value as I have been	93.94632720947266
228/3605	It came from my brother the King of	190.15109252929688

231/3605	In an hour you shall be ob	44.52745056152344
232/3605	You see the address said the queen speaking so low that M	794.103759765625
233/3605	Bonacieux could hardly hear what she said To my Lord Duke of Buckingham	498.9371337890625
234/3605	The letter shall be given to	234.92071533203125
235/3605	Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a	62.67659378051758
236/3605	Ten minutes afterward she was at	99.4112777709961
237/3605	As to the servant she had run away at the moment of her masters	112.04463958740234
238/3605	Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy her native	278.92498779296875
239/3605	The worthy mercer had immediately upon reentering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a	791.6307983398438
240/3605	This first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to	457.9403991699219
241/3605	Bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits Rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than	243.0302734375
242/3605	This was the more so because Bonacieuxs reflections were all rosecol	263.252685546875
243/3605	Rochefort called him his friend his dear Bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for	231.4828338623047
244/3605	The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	450.3001403808594
245/3605	Bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from	929.5154418945312
246/3605	In spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in	145.97329711914062
247/3605	Bonacieux having always lived among her husbands friendspeople little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her positionM	1251.118896484375
248/3605	Bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and DArtagnan was a	217.2953643798828
249/3605	Besides he wore the uniform of the Guards which next to that of the Musketeers was most admired by the	224.88751220703125
250/3605	He was we repeat handsome young and bold he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in	238.30406188964844
251/3605	There was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twentythree years old and M	437.1737976074219
252/3605	Bonacieux had just attained that happy period of	316.2266540527344
253/3605	The couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccup	136.7884521484375
254/3605	Nevertheless Bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open	395.1009216308594
255/3605	Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to	368.9078369140625
256/3605	Let us talk a little said	143.58538818359375
257/3605	Yes I have something of the highest importance to tell	81.41923522949219
258/3605	True said he and I have some questions sufficiently serious to put to	137.83782958984375
259/3605	Describe to me your abduction I pray	790.1676025390625
260/3605	Oh thats of no consequence just now said M	1053.255859375
261/3605	You speak very much at your ease madame said Bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in	221.66156005859375
262/3605	Do you know that I was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille   Oh a day and night soon pass	120.13735961914062
263/3605	Let us return to the object that brings me	307.1005554199219
264/3605	What that which brings you home to me Is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week asked the mercer piqued to the	189.1597442626953
265/3605	Yes that first and other things	739.3789672851562
266/3605	It is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps	293.8114318847656
267/3605	The complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you Madame Bonacieux and I should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many	131.69949340820312
268/3605	Yes particularly if you follow the instructions I am about to give	93.67430877685547
269/3605	There is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same	93.23221588134766
270/3605	Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak	191.1380615234375
271/3605	But a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu is no longer the same	124.5701675415039
272/3605	Much money to be gained said Bonacieux protruding his	1689.559814453125
273/3605	About how much   A thousand pistoles	41.142982482910156
274/3605	What you demand of me is serious then   It is	100.72906494140625
275/3605	What must be done   You must go away	52.94911193847656
276/3605	I will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper	143.5904541015625
277/3605	And whither am I to go   To	108.76493072509766
278/3605	I go to London Go to You jest I have no business in	340.8307800292969
279/3605	But others wish that you should go	319.55828857421875
280/3605	But who are those others I warn you that I will never again work in the dark and that I will know not only to what I expose myself but for whom I expose	121.13463592529297
281/3605	An illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits	1579.6690673828125
282/3605	The recompense will exceed your expectations that is all I promise	383.7545471191406
283/3605	More intrigues Nothing but intrigues Thank you madame I am aware of them now Monsieur Cardinal has enlightened me on that	394.37530517578125
284/3605	Have you seen the cardinal   He sent for me answered the mercer	245.86712646484375
285/3605	And you responded to his bidding you imprudent man   Well I cant say I had much choice of going or not going for I was taken to him between two	187.48805236816406
286/3605	It is true also that as I did not then know his Eminence if I had been able to dispense with the visit I should have been	91.72132873535156
287/3605	He illtreated you then he threatened you   He gave me his hand and called me his	113.68953704833984
288/3605	There are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should	486.19866943359375
289/3605	I am sorry for it madame but I acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom I have the honor to	47.83470153808594
290/3605	You serve the cardinal   Yes madame and as his servant I will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not French and who has a Spanish	80.15774536132812
291/3605	Fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the	702.6849975585938
292/3605	Nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her	310.75775146484375
293/3605	Ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen   Private interests are as nothing before the interests of	281.65130615234375
294/3605	I am for those who save the state said Bonacieux	732.002685546875
295/3605	And what do you know about the state you talk of said M	319.11029052734375
296/3605	Be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most	1735.94921875
297/3605	Madame replied Bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious Spaniard and what the cardinal does is well	378.736083984375
298/3605	Bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her	268.0143737792969
299/3605	You meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics Why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money   No to the	365.6474304199219

303/3605	But what do you require of me then Let us	42.81449508666992
304/3605	You must accomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you and on that condition I pardon everything I forget everything and what is more and she held out her hand to him I restore my	257.7715148925781
305/3605	Bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his	193.5968780517578
306/3605	A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of twenty	1494.7093505859375
307/3605	But my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of	251.65402221679688
308/3605	London is far from Paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers   What matters it if you avoid them   Hold Madame Bonacieux said the mercer hold I positively refuse intrigues terrify	454.326171875

311/3605	And _morbleu_ why do you not go yourself For in truth I think I have hitherto been deceived in	80.18309020996094
312/3605	I really believe you are a man and a violent one	138.84884643554688

317/3605	Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so	121.17184448242188
318/3605	She for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by	680.3470458984375
319/3605	Perhaps when all is considered you are	145.24510192871094
320/3605	In the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you Monsieur Bonacieux have conversed with the	255.78623962402344
321/3605	And yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection I thought I might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my f	233.46885681152344
322/3605	That is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant Bonacieux and I mistrust	448.8503112792969
323/3605	Well I will give it up then said the young woman sigh	55.08226013183594
324/3605	It is well as it is say no more about	62.25031661987305
325/3605	At least you should tell me what I should have to do in London replied Bonacieux who remembered a little too late that Rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wifes	97.49555969238281
326/3605	It is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw	106.3431167602539
327/3605	It was about one of those purchases that interest womena purchase by which much might have been	612.56494140625
328/3605	But the more the young woman excused herself the more important Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to	187.5038604736328
329/3605	He resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de Rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to	56.41856384277344
330/3605	Pardon me for quitting you my dear Madame Bonacieux said he but not knowing you would come to see me I had made an engagement with a	104.19132232666016
331/3605	I shall soon return and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late I will come back and reconduct you to the Lou	80.71669006347656
332/3605	Thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied M	121.31273651123047
333/3605	I shall return very safely to the Louvre all	348.1790771484375
334/3605	As you please Madame Bonacieux said the exmer	418.3387756347656
335/3605	Shall I see you again soon   Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and I will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much der	202.31982421875
336/3605	You are not angry with me   Not the least in the	25.607410430908203
337/3605	Till then then   Till	3361.405029296875
338/3605	Bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick	91.88912200927734
339/3605	Bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinal	259.3589782714844
340/3605	LOVER AND HUSBAND     Ah Madame said DArtagnan entering by the door which the young woman opened for him allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a	194.20785522460938
341/3605	You have then overheard our conversation asked M	3872.623046875
342/3605	Bonacieux eagerly and looking at DArtagnan with dis	50.789737701416016
343/3605	But how my God   By a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which I likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinals	163.83718872070312
344/3605	And what did you understand by what we said   A thousand	64.44760131835938
345/3605	I have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here I	171.14772033691406
346/3605	Bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her	153.86184692382812
347/3605	And what guarantee will you give me asked she if I consent to confide this message to you   My love for	166.3617706298828
348/3605	Speak Command What is to be done   My God my God murmured the young woman ought I to confide such a secret to you monsieur You are almost a	90.51581573486328
349/3605	I see that you require someone to answer for me   I admit that would reassure me	186.42283630371094
350/3605	Do you know Athos  	20.73634147644043
351/3605	Who are these gentleman   Three of the kings Musket	177.31790161132812
352/3605	Do you know Monsieur de Tréville their captain   Oh yes him I know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal	65.2983627319336
353/3605	You do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal   Oh no certainly not   Well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to	131.36074829101562
354/3605	But this secret is not mine and I cannot reveal it in this	84.26203155517578
355/3605	You were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux said DArtagnan with chag	71.59567260742188
356/3605	As one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a	284.08172607421875
357/3605	And yet meyou see plainly that I love	289.4309387207031
358/3605	Oh I am sure of that   Then put me to the	44.01859664916992
359/3605	Bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in	165.2815399169922
360/3605	Besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of	268.0727844238281
361/3605	The queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence andlet us admit itthe involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to	840.3456420898438
362/3605	Listen said she I yield to your protestations I yield to your	355.6349182128906
363/3605	But I swear to you before God who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me I will kill myself while accusing you of my	167.0164031982422
364/3605	And II swear to you before God madame said DArtagnan that if I am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me I will die sooner than do anything that may compromise	177.8246612548828
365/3605	Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the Samarit	282.9172668457031
366/3605	This was their mutual declaration of	710.2033081054688
367/3605	DArtagnan was radiant with joy and	29.313220977783203
368/3605	This secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved Confidence and love made him a	1407.0343017578125

370/3605	Bonacieux and your regiment your captain   By my soul you had made me forget all that dear Constance Yes you are right a furlough is need	530.8119506835938
371/3605	As to that cried DArtagnan after a moment of reflection I shall surmount it be	100.72992706298828
372/3605	How so   I will go this very evening to Tréville whom I will request to ask this favor for me of his brotherinlaw Monsieur Dessess	143.2401885986328
373/3605	You have perhaps no money   _Perhaps_ is too much said DArtagnan	93.19322967529297
374/3605	Bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this	299.6481628417969
375/3605	The cardinals cried DArtagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his	273.2198181152344
376/3605	You see it makes a very respectable	936.0439453125
377/3605	_Pardieu_ cried DArtagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinals money   You are an amiable and charming young man said M	105.70732116699219
378/3605	Be assured you will not find her Majesty ungr	147.2655029296875
379/3605	Oh I am already grandly recompensed cried DArtagn	79.97872161865234
380/3605	I love you you permit me to tell you that I dothat is already more happiness than I dared to	117.64141082763672
381/3605	What   Someone is talking in the	258.49017333984375
382/3605	It is the voice of   Of my husband Yes I recognize it   DArtagnan ran to the door and pushed the	47.98398971557617
383/3605	He shall not come in before I am gone said he and when I am gone you can open to	111.74356079101562
384/3605	But I ought to be gone	76.59859466552734
385/3605	And the disappearance of his money how am I to justify it if I am here   You are right we must go	70.29879760742188
386/3605	Go out How He will see us if we go	327.7354736328125
387/3605	Then you must come up into my	91.41429138183594
388/3605	Bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me   M	209.8150177001953
389/3605	Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her	68.0154037475586
390/3605	DArtagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her	188.35328674316406
391/3605	With me you will be as safe as in a temple I give you my word of a	113.60169982910156
392/3605	Once there for greater security the young man barricaded the	117.42687225341797
393/3605	They both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw Bonacieux talking with a man in a	298.2203369140625
394/3605	At sight of this man DArtagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the	46.662742614746094
395/3605	What are you going to do cried M	343.50689697265625
396/3605	Bonacieux you will ruin us all   But I have sworn to kill that man said DArtagn	32.264034271240234
397/3605	Your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to	67.67019653320312
398/3605	In the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your	148.53089904785156
399/3605	And do you command nothing in your own name   In my name said M	170.8679656982422
400/3605	Bonacieux with great emotion in my name I beg you But listen they appear to be speaking of	122.59907531738281
401/3605	DArtagnan drew near the window and lent his	50.61418151855469
402/3605	Bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an	48.177757263183594
403/3605	She is gone said he she must have returned to the Lou	74.04331970214844
404/3605	You are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out   No replied Bonacieux with a selfsufficient air she is too superficial a	233.83384704589844
405/3605	Is the young Guardsman at home   I do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shut	248.63690185546875
406/3605	All the same it is well to be	68.77076721191406
407/3605	How so   By knocking at his	123.02445983886719
408/3605	Bonacieux reentered the house passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives went up to DArtagnans door and	49.35490417480469
409/3605	Porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed Planc	215.7455596923828
410/3605	As to DArtagnan he took care not to give the least sign of	52.37864303588867
411/3605	The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within	205.25930786132812
412/3605	We shall be safer there than in the	216.90281677246094
413/3605	On the contrary said DArtagnan we shall hear	24.18706512451172
414/3605	DArtagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of Dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to M	226.25071716308594
415/3605	Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the	168.5901336669922
416/3605	You are sure there is nobody there said the	172.4074249267578
417/3605	I will answer for it said Bonacie	122.86236572265625
418/3605	And you think that your wife   Has returned to the Lou	49.03889083862305
419/3605	Without speaking to anyone but yourself   I am sure of	33.59556198120117
420/3605	That is an important point do you understand   Then the news I brought you is of value   The greatest my dear Bonacieux I dont conceal this from	125.05533599853516
421/3605	Then the cardinal will be pleased with me   I have no doubt of	26.564071655273438
422/3605	The great cardinal   Are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names   I think	110.1517562866211
423/3605	She did not name Madame de Chevreuse the Duke of Buckingham or Madame de Vernet   No she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the interests of an illustrious person	121.25629425048828
424/3605	Silence said DArtagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to	118.27660369873047
425/3605	Never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the	184.4646453857422
426/3605	You would then be in present possession of the	83.02752685546875
427/3605	The state which is now threatened would be safe and you   And I   Well youthe cardinal would have given you letters of	118.26933288574219
428/3605	Did he tell you so   Yes I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable	109.01545715332031
429/3605	Be satisfied replied Bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet	329.853759765625
430/3605	Silence said DArtagnan pressing her hand more	68.2547836303711
431/3605	How is there still time asked the man in the	93.4866714477539
432/3605	I go to the Louvre I ask for M	297.7873229980469
433/3605	Bonacieux I say that I have reflected I renew the affair I obtain the letter and I run directly to the	138.7397003173828
434/3605	Well go quickly I will return soon to learn the result of your	328.6106872558594
435/3605	Bonacieux addressing this epithet to her	446.062744140625
436/3605	Silence said DArtagnan pressing her hand still more warm	79.65452575683594
437/3605	A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of DArtagnan and M	473.45623779296875
438/3605	It was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying Thieves   Oh my God cried M	314.4944763183594
439/3605	Bonacieux he will rouse the whole	142.71311950683594
440/3605	Now he is gone it is your turn to get out said M	293.5999450683594
441/3605	Courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the	147.13832092285156
442/3605	To her and to you cried DArtagn	21.325410842895508
443/3605	I shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall I likewise return worthy of your love   The young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her	231.73695373535156
444/3605	A few seconds afterward DArtagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which illconcealed the sheath of a long	121.20294189453125
445/3605	PLAN OF CAMPAIGN     DArtagnan went straight to	1069.1700439453125
446/3605	He had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to	162.5583038330078
447/3605	The heart of the young man overflowed with	94.859130859375
448/3605	An opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he ad	220.11849975585938
449/3605	This chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of	86.56421661376953
450/3605	de Tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of	320.8897705078125
451/3605	DArtagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of	71.00708770751953
452/3605	DArtagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when	66.05472564697266
453/3605	At the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on	171.34295654296875
454/3605	All the way along DArtagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in	198.52320861816406
455/3605	de Tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him _carte blanche_ for some secret	462.1694030761719
456/3605	de Tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him	105.0071029663086
457/3605	Did you ask for me my good friend said	43.32341003417969
458/3605	Yes monsieur said DArtagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me I hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my	35.49799346923828
459/3605	It concerns nothing less said DArtagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the	66.4412841796875
460/3605	de Tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon DArtagn	96.12142944335938
461/3605	I say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret   Which you will guard I hope young man as your	93.64010620117188
462/3605	But which I must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission I have just received from her	94.6844711303711
463/3605	Is this secret your own   No monsieur it is her Majest	116.38150787353516
464/3605	Are you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me   No monsieur for on the contrary I am desired to preserve the profoundest	121.63397979736328
465/3605	Why then are you about to betray it to me   Because as I said without you I can do nothing and I am afraid you will refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I ask	48.50612258911133
466/3605	Keep your secret young man and tell me what you	61.53302764892578
467/3605	I wish you to obtain for me from Monsieur Dessessart leave of absence for fifteen	357.6584777832031
468/3605	You leave Paris   I am going on a	38.767433166503906
469/3605	May you tell me whither   To	106.75220489501953
470/3605	Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there   The cardinal I believe would give the world to prevent my	158.92764282226562
471/3605	And you are going alone   I am going	36.25362014770508
472/3605	In that case you will not get beyond Bond	1221.33154296875
473/3605	I tell you so by the faith of de Tré	94.8128662109375
474/3605	How so   You will be	40.18242645263672
475/3605	And I shall die in the performance of my	65.56950378417969
476/3605	But your mission will not be	88.0469741821289
477/3605	Believe me continued Tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set	352.908935546875
478/3605	Ah you are right monsieur said DArtagnan but you know Athos Porthos and Aramis and you know if I can dispose of	12.086666107177734
479/3605	Without confiding to them the secret which I am not willing to know   We are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all	303.6029052734375
480/3605	Besides you can tell them that you have full confidence in me and they will not be more incredulous than	62.97986602783203
481/3605	Sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their	672.0502319335938
482/3605	You are a hundred times too	83.65806579589844
483/3605	Begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight Ha But first write your request to Dessess	3292.952392578125
484/3605	Perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem	262.8594665527344
485/3605	DArtagnan drew up his request and	32.09056091308594
486/3605	de Tréville on receiving it assured him that by two oclock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the	148.6833953857422
487/3605	Have the goodness to send mine to Athoss	384.18646240234375
488/3605	I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go	511.7076416015625
489/3605	Have you any money   DArtagnan tapped the bag he had in his	41.01540756225586
490/3605	Oh plenty That would carry you to the end of the	221.5609588623047
491/3605	Begone then   DArtagnan saluted	34.1621208190918
492/3605	de Tréville who held out his hand to him DArtagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with	63.2341423034668
493/3605	Since his first arrival at Paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and	403.6381530761719
494/3605	His first visit was to Aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed M	238.66830444335938
495/3605	Still further he had seldom seen the young Musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his count	266.1810302734375
496/3605	This evening especially Aramis was melancholy and	461.9612121582031
497/3605	DArtagnan asked some questions about this prolonged	286.8258972167969
498/3605	Augustine which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good	163.9652099609375
499/3605	After the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from	106.74298858642578
500/3605	de Tréville entered bringing a sealed	1153.8621826171875
501/3605	The leave of absence Monsieur has asked for replied the lac	118.15321350097656
502/3605	For me I have asked for no leave of	175.16110229492188
503/3605	Hold your tongue and take it said DArtagn	32.70393753051758
504/3605	And you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell Monsieur de Tréville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to	39.850242614746094
505/3605	The lackey bowed to the ground and	93.01422882080078
506/3605	What does all this mean asked Aram	82.46591186523438
507/3605	Pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow	119.19243621826172
508/3605	But I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing   Aramis	84.44315338134766
509/3605	What is become of her I suppose you mean continued DArtagn	56.89968490600586
510/3605	The woman who was herethe woman with the embroidered handker	113.30329132080078
511/3605	Who told you there was a woman here replied Aramis becoming as pale as	138.72833251953125
512/3605	And you know who she is   I believe I can guess at	52.05698013305664
513/3605	Since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman   I presume that she has returned to	60.03654861450195
514/3605	But why did she return to Tours without telling me anything   Because she was in fear of being	153.47532653808594
515/3605	Why has she not written to me then   Because she was afraid of compromising	160.76307678222656
516/3605	DArtagnan you restore me to life cried Aram	58.4110107421875
517/3605	I was so delighted to see her again I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris   For the cause which today takes us to	156.38023376464844
518/3605	And what is this cause demanded Aram	181.7490234375
519/3605	Oh youll know it someday Aramis but at present I must imitate the discretion of the doctors	1497.0169677734375
520/3605	Aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain	160.82403564453125
521/3605	Well then since she has left Paris and you are sure of it DArtagnan nothing prevents me and I am ready to follow	52.367279052734375
522/3605	You say we are going   To see Athos now and if you will come thither I beg you to make haste for we have lost much time	84.04125213623047
523/3605	Will Bazin go with us asked Aram	104.60135650634766
524/3605	At all events it is best that he should follow us to Ath	105.69713592529297
525/3605	Aramis called Bazin and after having ordered him to join them at Athoss residence said Let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray	185.84698486328125
526/3605	When well assured this search was superfluous he followed DArtagnan wondering to himself how this young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of	274.38861083984375
527/3605	Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of DArtagnan and looking at him earnestly You have not spoken of this lady said	38.95399475097656
528/3605	Not even to Athos or Porthos   I have not breathed a syllable to	34.46863555908203
529/3605	Good enough   Tranquil on this important point Aramis continued his way with DArtagnan and both soon arrived at Athoss	251.47720336914062
530/3605	They found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and	110.16804504394531
531/3605	Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which I have just received said the astonished Ath	136.5548858642578
532/3605	MY DEAR ATHOS     I wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest     for a	358.9232482910156
533/3605	Go then and take the waters of Forges or any     that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as     quickly as	234.77850341796875
534/3605	Yours affectionate DE TRÉVILLE     Well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me Ath	665.5191650390625
535/3605	To the waters of Forges   There or	648.6356811523438
536/3605	In the kings service   Either the kings or the	115.41378021240234
537/3605	Are we not their Majesties servants   At that moment Porthos	349.18280029296875
538/3605	_Pardieu_ said he here is a strange thing Since when I wonder in the Musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it   Since said DArtagnan they have friends who ask it for	138.11778259277344
539/3605	Ah ah said Porthos it appears theres something fresh	242.8922882080078
540/3605	My faith I dont know much about it said Ath	79.30276489257812
541/3605	To London cried Porthos and what the devil are we going to do in London   That is what I am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to	31.666671752929688
542/3605	But in order to go to London added Porthos money is needed and I have	84.29912567138672
543/3605	I have replied DArtagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the	30.526721954345703
544/3605	There are in this bag three hundred pist	183.552734375
545/3605	Let each take seventyfive that is enough to take us to London and	717.7318725585938
546/3605	Besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at	1060.2822265625
547/3605	Why so   Because in all probability some one of us will be left on the	37.54224395751953
548/3605	Is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering   One of a most dangerous kind I give you	200.32968139648438
549/3605	Ah But if we do risk being killed said Porthos at least I should like to know what	92.12968444824219
550/3605	You would be all the wiser said Ath	138.29261779785156
551/3605	And yet said Aramis I am somewhat of Porthoss	90.2972183227539
552/3605	Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	260.3667907714844
553/3605	He says to you jauntily Gentlemen there is fighting going on in Gascony or in Flanders go and fight and you go	519.0399169921875
554/3605	Why You need give yourselves no more uneasiness about	325.5482177734375
555/3605	DArtagnan is right said Athos here are our three leaves of absence which came from Monsieur de Tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from I dont know	41.70335006713867
556/3605	So let us go and get killed where we are told to	113.29637908935547
557/3605	Is life worth the trouble of so many questions DArtagnan I am ready to follow	43.71185302734375
558/3605	And indeed I am not sorry to quit Paris I had need of	164.43655395507812
559/3605	Well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said DArtagn	314.9427490234375
560/3605	And now when are we to go asked Ath	107.7579345703125
561/3605	Immediately replied DArtagnan we have not a minute to	77.13029479980469
562/3605	Hello Grimaud Planchet Mousqueton Bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hô	154.0388946533203
563/3605	Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lac	347.21331787109375
564/3605	Planchet Grimaud Mousqueton and Bazin set off at full	32.44512176513672
565/3605	Now let us lay down the plan of campaign said Porth	74.09156799316406
566/3605	Where do we go first   To Calais said DArtagnan that is the most direct line to	87.46207427978516
567/3605	Well said Porthos this is my advice   Speak   Four men traveling together would be	87.20243072509766
568/3605	DArtagnan will give each of us his	69.3705825805664
569/3605	Gentlemen said Athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an	117.34866333007812
570/3605	A secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lac	503.77044677734375
571/3605	Porthoss plan appears to me to be impracticable said DArtagnan inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give	71.16436767578125
572/3605	I am the bearer of a letter that is	29.95436668395996
573/3605	I have not and I cannot make three copies of that letter because it is	321.6652526855469
574/3605	We must then as it appears to me travel in	281.0325927734375
575/3605	This letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the	141.04681396484375
576/3605	If I should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be anothers turn and so onprovided a single one arrives that is all that is	229.85067749023438
577/3605	Bravo DArtagnan your opinion is mine cried Athos Besides we must be consistent I am going to take the waters you will accompany	124.95037841796875
578/3605	Instead of taking the waters of Forges I go and take sea waters I am free to do	394.09014892578125
579/3605	If anyone wishes to stop us I will show Monsieur de Trévilles letter and you will show your leaves of	189.57203674316406
580/3605	If we are attacked we will defend ourselves if we are tried we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the	480.9907531738281
581/3605	They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a	737.0206298828125
582/3605	We will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as DArtagnan says will carry the	347.240478515625
583/3605	Well said cried Aramis you dont often speak Athos but when you do speak it is like	168.40155029296875
584/3605	And you Porthos   I agree to it too said Porthos if DArtagnan approves of	41.7248420715332
585/3605	DArtagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will	90.15485382080078
586/3605	Well said DArtagnan I decide that we should adopt Athoss plan and that we set off in half an	64.28453826904297
587/3605	Agreed shouted the three Musketeers in	695.8081665039062
588/3605	Each one stretching out his hand to the bag took his seventyfive pistoles and made his preparations to set out at the time	186.60897827148438
589/3605	THE JOURNEY     At two oclock in the morning our four adventurers left Paris by the Barrière	267.2080383300781
590/3605	As long as it was dark they remained silent in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every	417.1138000488281
591/3605	With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened with the sun gaiety	1465.84326171875
592/3605	It was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good	169.6619110107422
593/3605	Besides the appearance of the caravan was	948.4013671875
594/3605	The black horses of the Musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incogn	298.2210388183594
595/3605	The lackeys followed armed to the	805.6085205078125
596/3605	All went well till they arrived at Chantilly which they reached about eight oclock in the	66.61186218261719
597/3605	They needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an _auberge_ recommended by a sign representing	321.3554382324219
598/3605	Martin giving half his cloak to a poor	267.2270202636719
599/3605	They ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again	475.51104736328125
600/3605	They entered the common hall and placed themselves at	151.5672607421875
601/3605	A gentleman who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfast	121.3462905883789
602/3605	He opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers	563.3055419921875
603/3605	He drank to their good health and the travelers returned his polit	345.45355224609375
604/3605	But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to Porthos to drink the health of the	82.5445556640625
605/3605	Porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the	111.19995880126953
606/3605	The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his Emin	712.0513305664062
607/3605	Porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his	174.93447875976562
608/3605	You have committed a piece of folly said Athos but it cant be helped there is no drawing	174.3464813232422
609/3605	Kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you	50.92591857910156
610/3605	All three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing	358.97186279296875
611/3605	There goes one cried Athos at the end of five hundred p	64.22506713867188
612/3605	But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us asked Aram	100.6604995727539
613/3605	Because as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said DArtagn	58.09299850463867
614/3605	I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom murmured Athos and the travelers continued their	397.027099609375
615/3605	At Beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for Porth	95.61834716796875
616/3605	At the end of two hours as Porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their	83.34903717041016
617/3605	At a league from Beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with	478.1416931152344
618/3605	Aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather	10029.484375
619/3605	Athos wished to restrain him but it was too	97.06851196289062
620/3605	The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos who urged on his horse against one of	751.08447265625
621/3605	Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in	550.748291015625
622/3605	Aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the lo	405.3114929199219
623/3605	Therefore Mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really	116.64729309082031
624/3605	Dont waste a charge Forward   Aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the	197.8260955810547
625/3605	Mousquetons horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his	161.63258361816406
626/3605	That will serve us for a relay said Ath	433.78948974609375
627/3605	I would rather have had a hat said DArtagn	33.861732482910156
628/3605	Mine was carried away by a	81.95125579833984
629/3605	By my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in	44.01026153564453
630/3605	Theyll kill poor Porthos when he comes up said Aram	163.9590301513672
631/3605	If Porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said Ath	35.42037582397461
632/3605	My opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not	267.919189453125
633/3605	They continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse	242.33352661132812
634/3605	The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption but at Crèvecœur Aramis declared he could proceed no	1926.415771484375
635/3605	In fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so	380.58392333984375
636/3605	He grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his	137.15969848632812
637/3605	They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left Bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Am	219.74012756347656
638/3605	_Morbleu_ said Athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and Grimaud and Planchet _Morbleu_ I wont be their dupe I will answer for	155.54234313964844
639/3605	I will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and	628.5101928710938
640/3605	I swear by   Dont waste time in swearing said DArtagnan let us gallop if our horses will	169.3434600830078
641/3605	And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their	8608.421875
642/3605	They arrived at Amiens at midnight and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden	462.1343688964844
643/3605	The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on	274.5855712890625
644/3605	He received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the	374.4480895996094
645/3605	He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hô	363.4940490722656
646/3605	The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the	256.88250732421875
647/3605	The host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they	218.33721923828125
648/3605	They had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the	459.2789306640625
649/3605	Grimaud can take care of the horses said Planc	83.51329803466797
650/3605	If you are willing gentlemen I will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach	262.2152404785156
651/3605	And on what will you sleep said DArtagn	27.571712493896484
652/3605	Here is my bed replied Planchet producing a bundle of	247.19232177734375
653/3605	Come then said DArtagnan you are	9.814153671264648
654/3605	Mine hosts face does not please me at all it is too	707.6038818359375
655/3605	Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five oclock in the morning he and the four horses should be	95.52300262451172
656/3605	Toward two oclock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door but as Planchet awoke in an instant and cried Who goes there somebody replied that he was mistaken and went	136.9100799560547
657/3605	At four oclock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the st	48.36604309082031
658/3605	Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten	2424.04150390625
659/3605	When they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitch	1027.462890625
660/3605	Planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used	84.18122863769531
661/3605	All these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a	376.5232238769531
662/3605	Athos and DArtagnan went out while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were not three horses for sale in the	62.32673645019531
663/3605	At the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully	2417.426025390625
664/3605	He asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the	195.94265747070312
665/3605	Athos went down to pay the reckoning while DArtagnan and Planchet stood at the street	54.413841247558594
666/3605	The host was in a lower and back room to which Athos was requested to	194.48541259765625
667/3605	Athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the	427.4054260253906
668/3605	The host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly	188.3949737548828
669/3605	He took the money which Athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as for	167.72366333007812
670/3605	You blackguard cried Athos going toward him Ill cut your ears off   At the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon Ath	449.19183349609375
671/3605	I am taken shouted Athos with all the power of his	150.30609130859375
672/3605	Go on DArtagnan Spur spur and he fired two	521.7135620117188
673/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gall	98.51628112792969
674/3605	Do you know what has become of Athos asked DArtagnan of Planchet as they galloped	23.719730377197266
675/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet I saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the	54.873741149902344
676/3605	Brave Athos murmured DArtagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces	109.66065216064453
677/3605	Forward Planchet forward You are a brave	138.2471160888672
678/3605	As I told you monsieur replied Planchet Picards are found out by being	192.10496520996094
679/3605	Besides I am here in my own country and that excites	170.47943115234375
680/3605	And both with free use of the spur arrived at	1149.60693359375
681/3605	Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed	258.0302429199219
682/3605	At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais DArtagnans horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his	86.52034759521484
683/3605	There still remained Planchets horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a	158.6609649658203
684/3605	Fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the qu	100.45368957519531
685/3605	Planchet called his masters attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty p	87.34508514404297
686/3605	They made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great	90.42686462402344
687/3605	His boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to	163.7475128173828
688/3605	Nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the	165.54299926757812
689/3605	I have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket here it	113.77099609375

692/3605	And that is situated   At a quarter of a league from the	35.140071868896484
693/3605	Look you may see it from hereat the foot of that little hill that slated	1477.4942626953125
694/3605	And with his lackey he took the road to the governors country	113.50872802734375
695/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred p	16.857894897460938
696/3605	Once outside the city DArtagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little	95.4205322265625
697/3605	Monsieur you appear to be in great haste   No one can be more so monsie	33.61103439331055
698/3605	I am sorry for that said DArtagnan for as I am in great haste likewise I wish to beg you to render me a	51.413150787353516
699/3605	What   To let me sail	171.92771911621094
700/3605	Thats impossible said the gentleman I have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours and by tomorrow at midday I must be in	423.0892333984375
701/3605	I have performed that same distance in forty hours and by ten oclock in the morning I must be in	65.85558319091797
702/3605	Very sorry monsieur but I was here first and will not sail	132.11764526367188
703/3605	I am sorry too monsieur but I arrived second and must sail	199.32424926757812
704/3605	But this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to	109.80973052978516
705/3605	_Parbleu_ What do you desire it to be   What do you want   Would you like to know  	38.28456115722656
706/3605	Well then I wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that I have not one of my own and must have	97.97323608398438
707/3605	Let me pass   You shall not	115.8067855834961
708/3605	My brave young man I will blow out your	86.59439849853516
709/3605	_Hola_ Lubin my pistols   Planchet called out DArtagnan take care of the lackey I will manage the	200.8717498779297
710/3605	Planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon Lubin and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his	592.2626953125
711/3605	Go on with your affair monsieur cried Planchet I have finished	53.938934326171875
712/3605	Seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon DArtagnan but he had too strong an	85.64640808105469
713/3605	In three seconds DArtagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust One for Athos one for Porthos and one for Aramis   At the third hit the gentleman fell like a	199.48284912109375
714/3605	This time the gentleman closed his eyes and f	102.72796630859375
715/3605	DArtagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the	79.87688446044922
716/3605	It was in the name of Comte de Ward	453.1489562988281
717/3605	But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his	1170.0225830078125
718/3605	Planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he	100.81835174560547
719/3605	Monsieur said he as long as I hold him in this manner he cant cry Ill be bound but as soon as I let go he will howl	206.59886169433594
720/3605	I know him for a Norman and Normans are obst	1306.7410888671875
721/3605	In fact tightly held as he was Lubin endeavored still to cry	2677.7587890625
722/3605	Stay said DArtagnan and taking out his handkerchief he gagged	30.484569549560547
723/3605	Now said Planchet let us bind him to a	56.67950439453125
724/3605	This being properly done they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his servant and as night was approaching and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next	237.01998901367188
725/3605	And now said DArtagnan to the	110.83516693115234
726/3605	But you are wounded it seems said Planc	68.30403900146484
727/3605	Oh thats nothing Let us attend to what is more pressing first and then we will attend to my wound besides it does not seem very	170.6717987060547
728/3605	And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy function	284.32958984375
729/3605	The Comte de Wardes was announced and DArtagnan was	208.824462890625
730/3605	You have an order signed by the cardinal said the	91.90494537353516
731/3605	Yes monsieur replied DArtagnan here it	7.724581241607666
732/3605	Ah ah It is quite regular and explicit said the	743.9652099609375
733/3605	Most likely said DArtagnan I am one of his most faithful	25.618579864501953
734/3605	It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to England   Yes a certain DArtagnan a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to	265.9490966796875
735/3605	Do you know him personally asked the	96.8731918334961
736/3605	And DArtagnan gave feature for feature a description of the Comte de Ward	418.3890380859375
737/3605	Is he accompanied   Yes by a lackey named Lub	585.7183227539062
738/3605	We will keep a sharp lookout for them and if we lay hands on them his Eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good	159.8526611328125
739/3605	And by doing so Monsieur the Governor said DArtagnan you will deserve well of the	110.8763427734375
740/3605	Shall you see him on your return Monsieur Count   Without a	105.41808319091797
741/3605	Tell him I beg you that I am his humble	152.73497009277344
742/3605	Delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to DArtagn	189.90725708007812
743/3605	DArtagnan lost no time in useless	105.0780258178711
744/3605	He thanked the governor bowed and	604.1762084960938
745/3605	Once outside he and Planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another	175.83291625976562
746/3605	The vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wh	153.23854064941406
747/3605	Here is my pass countersigned said the	2628.59716796875
748/3605	And that other gentleman   He will not go today said DArtagnan but here Ill pay you for us	90.01764678955078
749/3605	In that case let us go said the ship	165.51197814941406
750/3605	He leaped with Planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on	51.70111846923828
751/3605	It was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when DArtagnan saw a flash and heard a deton	195.6666717529297
752/3605	It was the cannon which announced the closing of the	168.31871032714844
753/3605	He had now leisure to look to his	725.80419921875
754/3605	Fortunately as DArtagnan had thought it was not	34.060211181640625
755/3605	The point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the	586.649658203125
756/3605	Still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of	159.25384521484375
757/3605	A mattress was laid upon the deck for	586.1298828125
758/3605	He threw himself upon it and fell	87.67841339111328
759/3605	On the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of	117.35751342773438
760/3605	The breeze had been so light all night they had made but little	554.9426879882812
761/3605	At ten oclock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of Dover and at half past ten DArtagnan placed his foot on English land crying Here I am at last   But that was not all they must get to	130.80296325683594
762/3605	In England the post was well	706.7183837890625
763/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before	182.3362579345703
764/3605	In a few hours they were in the	67.33824157714844
765/3605	DArtagnan did not know London he did not know a word of English but he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the dukes hô	64.40953826904297
766/3605	The duke was at Windsor hunting with the	1392.5269775390625
767/3605	DArtagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke French perfectly well he told him that he came from Paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master	110.0970458984375
768/3605	The confidence with which DArtagnan spoke convinced Patrick which was the name of this minister of the	161.24798583984375
769/3605	He ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young Guards	964.7169799804688
770/3605	As for Planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush the poor lads strength was almost	146.8333740234375
771/3605	On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues	547.71240234375
772/3605	In twenty minutes they were on the spot	145.01402282714844

774/3605	Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke asked	8218.6884765625
775/3605	The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont Neuf opposite the Samarit	421.4399719238281

778/3605	No misfortune has happened to the queen cried Buckingham the instant he came up throwing all his fear and love into the	216.133544921875
779/3605	I believe not nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from which your Grace alone can extricate	908.0732421875
780/3605	What is it I should be too happy to be of any service to	47.94926071166992
781/3605	Speak speak   Take this letter said DArtagn	48.796722412109375
782/3605	This letter From whom comes this letter   From her Majesty as I	526.2559204101562
783/3605	From her Majesty said Buckingham becoming so pale that DArtagnan feared he would faint as he broke the	275.35577392578125
784/3605	What is this rent said he showing DArtagnan a place where it had been pierced	114.62029266357422
785/3605	Ah said DArtagnan I did not see that it was the sword of the Comte de Wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the	85.452880859375
786/3605	You are wounded asked Buckingham as he opened the	457.592041015625
787/3605	Oh nothing but a scratch said DArtagn	36.04664611816406

789/3605	Patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his Majesty that I humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to	268.20294189453125
790/3605	Come monsieur come and both set off towards the capital at full gall	51.0125617980957
791/3605	THE COUNTESS DE WINTER     As they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from DArtagnan not all that had happened but what DArtagnan himself	298.145263671875
792/3605	By adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queens letter short but explicit gave him the	329.5955810546875
793/3605	But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in England had not succeeded in arresting him on the	247.8737335205078
794/3605	The horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of	69.76163482666016
795/3605	DArtagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not	194.7234344482422
796/3605	He kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the	649.1162109375
797/3605	In fact in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked	264.08575439453125
798/3605	DArtagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled	875.895751953125
799/3605	On entering the court of his hôtel Buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestib	156.04258728027344
800/3605	DArtagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the st	184.24444580078125
801/3605	The duke walked so fast that DArtagnan had some trouble in keeping up with	90.05062103271484
802/3605	He passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of	160.86361694335938
803/3605	In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same	114.93433380126953
804/3605	Encouraged by this invitation DArtagnan followed the duke who closed the door after	75.20649719238281
805/3605	The two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of	492.967041015625
806/3605	Over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a fulllength portrait of Anne of Austria so perfect in its resemblance that DArtagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding	274.009033203125
807/3605	One might believe the queen was about to	63.83002853393555
808/3605	On the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond stud	474.0361022949219
809/3605	The duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the c	128.69677734375
810/3605	There said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with	203.03857421875
811/3605	The queen gave them to me the queen requires them	376.8735046386719
812/3605	Her will be done like that of God in all	108.22518920898438
813/3605	Then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to	167.59278869628906
814/3605	All at once he uttered a terrible	72.43409729003906
815/3605	What is the matter exclaimed DArtagnan anxiously what has happened to you my Lord   All is lost cried Buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only	118.36309814453125
816/3605	Can you have lost them my Lord or do you think they have been stolen   They have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this	100.8207015991211
817/3605	Hold see The ribbons which held them have been cut with	1612.9434814453125
818/3605	If my Lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his	610.3953247070312
819/3605	The only time I have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at	758.9418334960938
820/3605	The Comtesse de Winter with whom I had quarreled became reconciled to me at that	439.3216247558594
821/3605	That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous	1106.142578125
822/3605	I have never seen her from that	62.021671295166016
823/3605	The woman is an agent of the	228.56517028808594
824/3605	He has agents then throughout the world cried DArtagn	115.69075775146484
825/3605	Oh yes said Buckingham grating his teeth with	690.5523681640625
826/3605	But when is this ball to take place   Monday	1033.67138671875
827/3605	Monday next Still five days before	1290.093994140625
828/3605	Patrick cried the duke opening the door of the chapel Patrick His confidential valet	486.3652038574219
829/3605	The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without	366.34619140625
830/3605	But although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his	303.4842224121094
831/3605	This was simply because he lived in the hô	248.29922485351562
832/3605	He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own	222.4894256591797
833/3605	Jackson said he go instantly to the Lord Chancellor and tell him that I charge him with the execution of these	203.89341735839844
834/3605	I wish them to be promulgated	1403.1375732421875
835/3605	But my Lord if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall I reply   That such is my pleasure and that I answer for my will to no	441.91302490234375
836/3605	Will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his Majesty if by chance his Majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great Britain   You are right	294.2104187011719
837/3605	He will say in that case to the king that I am determined on war and that this measure is my first act of hostility against	190.16986083984375
838/3605	We are safe on that side said Buckingham turning toward DArtagn	131.2425994873047
839/3605	If the studs are not yet gone to Paris they will not arrive till after	183.71868896484375
840/3605	How so   I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his Majestys ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an	1232.545166015625
841/3605	DArtagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrig	76.89299774169922
842/3605	Buckingham saw by the expression of the young mans face what was passing in his mind and he	153.85751342773438
843/3605	Yes said he yes Anne of Austria is my true	208.64183044433594
844/3605	Upon a word from her I would betray my country I would betray my king I would betray my	185.35879516601562
845/3605	She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle the assistance I promised them I have not done	221.85337829589844
846/3605	I broke my word it is true but what signifies that I obeyed my love and have I not been richly paid for that obedience It was to that obedience I owe her	241.696044921875
847/3605	DArtagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are	533.8982543945312
848/3605	He was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith	351.85369873046875
849/3605	He was an Irishmanone of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of	141.23500061035156
850/3605	OReilly said the duke leading him into the chapel look at these diamond studs and tell me what they are worth	424.1483154296875
851/3605	The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set calculated one with another what the diamonds were worth and without hesitation said Fifteen hundred pistoles each my	768.5579833984375
852/3605	How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them You see there are two	609.421630859375
853/3605	I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by the day after	70.8916244506836
854/3605	You are a jewel of a man	760.452392578125
855/3605	These studs cannot be trusted to anybody it must be done in the	134.6253662109375
856/3605	Impossible my Lord There is no one but myself can so execute them that one cannot tell the new from the	369.04296875
857/3605	And if you wish ever to leave my palace you cannot so make the best of	203.58767700195312
858/3605	Name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must	228.1761932373047
859/3605	He knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to	866.98388671875
860/3605	May I be permitted to inform my wife said	98.07976531982422
861/3605	Oh you may even see her if you like my dear	252.05404663085938
862/3605	Your captivity shall be mild be assured and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance I cause	378.1519470214844
863/3605	DArtagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus openhanded sported with men and	410.0090026855469
864/3605	As to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary	494.3551940917969
865/3605	Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a	498.959228515625
866/3605	Then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_	272.2834167480469
867/3605	We need not add that the goldsmith OReilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any	1337.9508056640625
868/3605	This point settled the duke turned to DArtagn	57.102176666259766
869/3605	Now my young friend said he England is all our	110.8331527709961
870/3605	What do you wish for What do you desire   A bed my Lord replied DArtagn	39.837890625
871/3605	At present I confess that is the thing I stand most in need	170.58432006835938
872/3605	Buckingham gave DArtagnan a chamber adjoining his	929.95166015625
873/3605	He wished to have the young man at handnot that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the	136.5651092529297
874/3605	In one hour after the ordinance was published in London that no vessel bound for France should leave port not even the packet boat with	1288.43896484375
875/3605	In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two	179.85818481445312
876/3605	Here said he to him are the diamond studs that you came to bring and be my witness that I have done all that human power could	169.8684844970703
877/3605	Be satisfied my Lord I will tell all that I have	64.46134185791016
878/3605	But does your Grace mean to give me the studs without the casket   The casket would encumber	385.6055603027344
879/3605	Besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to	113.1042709350586
880/3605	You will say that I keep	77.91243743896484
881/3605	I will perform your commission word for word my	1011.461181640625
882/3605	And now resumed Buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you   DArtagnan blushed up to the whites of his	182.62261962890625
883/3605	He saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with English gold was strangely repugnant to	110.09242248535156
884/3605	Let us understand each other my Lord replied DArtagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no	69.1858901977539
885/3605	I am in the service of the King and Queen of France and form part of the company of Monsieur Dessessart who as well as his brotherinlaw Monsieur de Tréville is particularly attached to their Majest	157.5207061767578
886/3605	What I have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your	244.98544311523438
887/3605	And still further it is very probable I should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is	95.61839294433594
888/3605	Yes said the duke smiling and I even believe that I know that other person it is   My Lord I have not named her interrupted the young man warm	70.41738891601562
889/3605	That is true said the duke and it is to this person I am bound to discharge my debt of	84.73860931396484
890/3605	We say Proud as a Scotsman murmured the Duke of	1190.4521484375
891/3605	And we say Proud as a Gascon replied DArtagn	101.45066833496094
892/3605	The Gascons are the Scots of	356.17987060546875
893/3605	DArtagnan bowed to the duke and was	31.797988891601562
894/3605	Well are you going away in that manner Where and how   Thats true   Fore Gad these Frenchmen have no consideration   I had forgotten that England was an island and that you were the king of	186.77294921875
895/3605	Go to the riverside ask for the brig _Sund_ and give this letter to the captain he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by	537.9453125
896/3605	The name of that port  	180.65257263183594
897/3605	When you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a signa mere fishermans	406.9252014160156
898/3605	You cannot be mistaken there is but	50.698604583740234
899/3605	Afterward   You will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word Forward   Which means   In French _En avant	260.3926086425781
900/3605	He will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to	100.9556884765625
901/3605	You will find in the same way four relays on your	238.66317749023438
902/3605	If you will give at each of these relays your address in Paris the four horses will follow you th	282.66387939453125
903/3605	You already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a	288.0539855957031
904/3605	They were those we rode on and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to	168.02857971191406
905/3605	These horses are equipped for the	3399.740966796875
906/3605	However proud you may be you will not refuse to accept one of them and to request your three companions to accept the othersthat is in order to make war against	95.70706939697266
907/3605	Besides the end justified the means as you Frenchmen say does it not   Yes my Lord I accept them said DArtagnan and if it please God we will make a good use of your	101.71577453613281
908/3605	Perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends I	70.80155944824219
909/3605	Yes my Lord but with the hope of soon becoming	1080.0299072265625
910/3605	I depend upon your word my	237.7882843017578
911/3605	DArtagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the rivers	45.58686828613281
912/3605	Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to	246.10031127929688
913/3605	Fifty vessels were waiting to set	1807.1597900390625
914/3605	The next day about nine oclock in the morning he landed at	64.6898193359375
915/3605	DArtagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from	134.33973693847656
916/3605	War between England and France was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carous	922.7451171875
917/3605	I want to know the route I am to follow said DArtagn	33.279788970947266
918/3605	Go from hence to Blangy and from Blangy to Neufchâ	13516.6015625
919/3605	At Neufchâtel go to the tavern of the Golden Harrow give the password to the landlord and you will find as you have here a horse ready sadd	573.091064453125
920/3605	Have I anything to pay demanded DArtagn	94.0682144165039
921/3605	Everything is paid replied the host and liber	845.6557006835938
922/3605	Begone and may God guide you   Amen cried the young man and set off at full gall	83.80963134765625
923/3605	Four hours later he was in Neufchâ	3294.519775390625
924/3605	He strictly followed the instructions he had	533.4425048828125
925/3605	Valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting	222.35833740234375
926/3605	He was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill but he found the holsters furnished with similar	149.1055450439453
927/3605	Your address at Paris   Hôtel of the Guards company of Dessess	1259.37939453125
928/3605	Which route must I take demanded DArtagnan in his	107.58686065673828
929/3605	That of Rouen but you will leave the city on your	213.77162170410156
930/3605	You must stop at the little village of Eccuis in which there is but one tavernthe Shield of	1602.5426025390625
931/3605	Dont condemn it from appearances you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as	153.07713317871094
932/3605	Adieu master   A good journey gentlemen Do you want anything   DArtagnan shook his head and set off at full	59.3377799987793
933/3605	At Eccuis the same scene was	3219.353515625
934/3605	He found as provident a host and a fresh	613.3731079101562
935/3605	He left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for Ponto	114.43035888671875
936/3605	At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine oclock galloped into the yard of Trévilles hô	150.4271240234375
937/3605	He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve	326.9303894042969
938/3605	Eight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hôtel de Ville for this important	60.60340118408203
939/3605	These keys were given up to him	370.55023193359375
940/3605	Each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized and from that moment the Sieur de la Coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the	289.1431884765625
941/3605	At eleven oclock came in his turn Duhallier captain of the Guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the Hôtel de Ville at the doors assigned	655.6934814453125
942/3605	At three oclock came two companies of the Guards one French the other	1710.0970458984375

946/3605	At nine oclock Madame la Première Présidente	21936.8046875

951/3605	It was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre to the Hôtel de Ville and which were all illuminated with colored lantern	44.61000061035156
952/3605	His Majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal Highness	556.380615234375

956/3605	A private room had been prepared for the king and another for Monsie	82.51197052001953
957/3605	In each of these closets were placed masquerade	2226.726318359375
958/3605	The same had been done for the queen and Madame the	365.38336181640625
959/3605	The nobles and ladies of their Majesties suites were to dress two by two in chambers prepared for the	1902.3914794921875
960/3605	Before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal	213.35195922851562
961/3605	Half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard these announced the arrival of the	132.2689208984375

964/3605	At the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a Spanish caval	110.5499267578125
965/3605	His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond stud	124.74445343017578
966/3605	The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the	137.4982452392578
967/3605	All at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the	56.197914123535156
968/3605	The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very	37.648956298828125
969/3605	The king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely	144.96023559570312
970/3605	Sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this I feared some accident might happen to	89.18051147460938
971/3605	If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself there	421.29931640625
972/3605	I tell you that you were	25.469480514526367
973/3605	The voice of the king was tremulous with	111.7590103149414
974/3605	Everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what	410.4350280761719
975/3605	Sire said the queen I can send for them to the Louvre where they are and thus your Majestys wishes will be complied	142.67486572265625

977/3605	The queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her	244.60992431640625
978/3605	On his part the king returned to his	147.97991943359375
979/3605	There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the	130.79747009277344
980/3605	Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard	345.9851989746094
981/3605	The violins began to sound with all their might but nobody listened to	957.619873046875

983/3605	He was in a most elegant hunting costume and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like	134.52294921875
984/3605	This was the costume that best became the	294.602783203125
985/3605	So dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his	344.3360595703125
986/3605	The cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small c	65.26001739501953
987/3605	The king opened it and found in it two diamond stud	597.0109252929688
988/3605	What does this mean demanded he of the	224.8001251220703
989/3605	Nothing replied the latter only if the queen has the studs which I very much doubt count them sire and if you only find ten ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are	434.7774658203125
990/3605	The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him but he had not time to address any question to hima cry of admiration burst from every	94.062744140625
991/3605	If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in	106.20128631591797
992/3605	It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admir	358.0635681152344
993/3605	She wore a beaver hat with blue feathers a surtout of graypearl velvet fastened with diamond clasps and a petticoat of blue satin embroidered with	868.1537475585938
994/3605	On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the pettico	514.8529052734375
995/3605	The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the stud	204.20701599121094
996/3605	The only question was had she ten or twelve   At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the	244.5684051513672
997/3605	The king advanced toward Madame the President with whom he was to dance and his Highness Monsieur with the	292.7713317871094
998/3605	They took their places and the ballet	169.1941375732422
999/3605	The king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the	260.798828125
1000/3605	A cold sweat covered the brow of the	144.85107421875
1001/3605	The ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen _entrées	2463.330322265625
1002/3605	The ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the	279.89410400390625
1003/3605	I thank you madame said he for the deference you have shown to my wishes but I think you want two of the studs and I bring them back to	69.97039031982422
1004/3605	With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given	86.43890380859375
1005/3605	How sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more I shall have	313.40899658203125
1006/3605	In fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her Majestys	1176.4158935546875
1007/3605	What does this mean Monsieur Cardinal asked the king in a severe	118.77713012695312
1008/3605	This means sire replied the cardinal that I was desirous of presenting her Majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself I adopted this means of inducing her to accept	173.7836456298828
1009/3605	And I am the more grateful to your Eminence replied Anne of Austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his	238.16458129882812
1010/3605	Then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her	84.82476043701172
1011/3605	The queen had just regained her chamber and DArtagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly	124.60848999023438
1012/3605	He turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow	58.54354476928711
1013/3605	The face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent M	386.10064697265625
1014/3605	On the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the Swiss guard Germain whither DArtagnan had sent for	61.18377685546875
1015/3605	The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few	245.43186950683594
1016/3605	Bonacieux moved by a double sentimentlove and	715.6362915039062
1017/3605	At length after winding about for a minute or two M	4144.66552734375
1018/3605	Bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led DArtagnan into	50.2076301574707
1019/3605	There she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapest	111.23049926757812
1020/3605	The opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she	944.466064453125
1021/3605	The young man waited in comparative darkness and	3212.38525390625
1022/3605	The queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of	229.58560180664062
1023/3605	Although DArtagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal	381.5203857421875
1024/3605	He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the	332.4549255371094
1025/3605	At length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapest	352.2594299316406
1026/3605	DArtagnan at once comprehended that this was his recomp	58.29829025268555
1027/3605	He cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his	54.188297271728516
1028/3605	Then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a	148.45138549804688
1029/3605	The door immediately closed and DArtagnan found himself again in complete	121.70470428466797
1030/3605	DArtagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet	56.35935974121094

1034/3605	Jean had struck three quarters past	578.784912109375
1035/3605	The sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining	658.2476196289062
1036/3605	The company was then heard departing then the door of the closet in which DArtagnan was was opened and M	227.9920654296875
1037/3605	Silence said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came   But where and when shall I see you again cried DArtagn	70.74594116210938
1038/3605	A note which you will find at home will tell	137.27708435058594
1039/3605	Begone begone   At these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed DArtagnan out of the	51.000244140625
1040/3605	DArtagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in	102.38603210449219
1041/3605	THE RENDEZVOUS     DArtagnan ran home immediately and although it was three oclock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of Paris to traverse he met with no misad	366.05859375

1044/3605	Planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the Hôtel de Ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for	58.176239013671875
1045/3605	The reader may ask How came Planchet here when he was left stiff as a rush in	576.9519653320312
1046/3605	In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent him to Paris as he did the	421.4190673828125
1047/3605	Has anyone brought a letter for me asked DArtagnan	68.74771118164062
1048/3605	No one has _brought_ a letter monsieur replied Planchet but one has come of	140.47195434570312
1049/3605	What do you mean blockhead   I mean to say that when I came in although I had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me I found a letter on the green table cover in your	121.05097961425781
1050/3605	And where is that letter   I left it where I found it monsie	36.4105110168457

1053/3605	Beware monsieur there is certainly some magic	379.3531188964844
1054/3605	Meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the	60.57777404785156
1055/3605	Bonacieux and was expressed in these terms   There are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to	74.91990661621094

1058/3605	While reading this letter DArtagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of	260.4186706542969
1059/3605	It was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted	69.53872680664062

1062/3605	Left alone DArtagnan read and reread his b	537.6842651367188
1063/3605	Then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful	453.1591491699219
1064/3605	At length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden	411.608642578125
1065/3605	At seven oclock in the morning he arose and called Planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding	62.29708480834961
1066/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan I am going out for all day	20.7746524810791

1072/3605	Ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps   Well if you are really afraid Monsieur Planchet resumed DArtagnan I will go without	127.1966323852539
1073/3605	I prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least	434.44921875
1074/3605	Monsieur does me wrong said Planchet I thought he had seen me at	59.984580993652344
1075/3605	Yes but I thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first	97.463623046875

1080/3605	It appears that our journey was a remounting journey then   Exactly so said DArtagnan and nodding to Planchet he went	61.52683639526367
1081/3605	DArtagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with	344.4020690917969

1083/3605	Cloud opposite DEstréess pavilion DArtagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could	392.2332458496094
1084/3605	The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor	627.4309692382812
1085/3605	Bonacieux who was ignorant that DArtagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of Meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster	186.3363494873047

1095/3605	A slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux but so slight that DArtagnan did not perceive	108.01628875732422
1096/3605	Ah may you be a true prophet said DArtagnan	47.04602813720703
1097/3605	No what I say replied Bonacieux is only that I may know whether I am delaying	211.35516357421875
1098/3605	Why that question my dear host asked DArtagn	59.4173698425293

1111/3605	Amuse yourself well replied Bonacieux in a sepulchral	136.32749938964844
1112/3605	But DArtagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked	76.20426940917969

1187/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet on perceiving DArtagnan how glad I am to see	19.42595863342285
1188/3605	Why so Planchet asked the young	34.13768768310547
1189/3605	Do you place confidence in our landlordMonsieur Bonacieux   I Not the least in the	203.07623291015625
1190/3605	And you found it   Traitorous monsie	356.1120910644531
1191/3605	Indeed   Still more as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite	69.47561645507812
1192/3605	It seems you are right Planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to	208.6085205078125
1193/3605	What would you have Planchet What must come is	164.07601928710938

1195/3605	At nine oclock then be ready here at the hôtel I will come and take	146.59710693359375
1196/3605	Planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third	213.7625274658203
1197/3605	As to DArtagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the Gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of	144.7635040283203
1198/3605	THE PAVILION     At nine oclock DArtagnan was at the Hôtel des Gardes he found Planchet all	155.0302276611328
1199/3605	Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a	216.5285186767578
1200/3605	DArtagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed	142.09844970703125
1201/3605	It was quite dark and no one saw them go	98.208740234375
1202/3605	Planchet took place behind his master and kept at a distance of ten paces from	45.713348388671875
1203/3605	DArtagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of La Conférence and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to	301.7955017089844
1204/3605	In fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneas	380.32122802734375
1205/3605	But why did you not dare to speak aloud Planchetbecause you are afraid   Afraid of being heard Yes monsie	90.62525177001953
1206/3605	Afraid of being heard Why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear Planchet and no one could find fault with	199.53602600097656
1207/3605	Ah monsieur replied Planchet recurring to his besetting idea that Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his	315.4447326660156
1208/3605	What the devil makes you think of Bonacieux   Monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we	64.87284088134766
1209/3605	Monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a	156.09222412109375
1210/3605	And you are very virtuous are you not Planchet   Monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder Had we not better lower our heads   In truth murmured DArtagnan to whom	96.44221496582031

1212/3605	And he put his horse into a tro	76.71015167236328
1213/3605	Planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his	79.3864517211914
1214/3605	Are we going to continue this pace all night asked Planc	107.05704498291016
1215/3605	No you are at your journeys	702.315185546875
1216/3605	How monsieur And you   I am going a few steps	34.946922302246094
1217/3605	Well if you are cold Planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six oclock in the	66.58261108398438
1218/3605	Monsieur I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that I have not a sou left in case I should be	110.01758575439453
1219/3605	DArtagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to Planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around	65.64968872070312
1220/3605	Good Lord how cold I am cried Planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the	113.43016052246094
1221/3605	In the meantime DArtagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached	186.42539978027344
1222/3605	Cloud but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion	216.5481414794922
1223/3605	It was situated in a very private	285.5822448730469
1224/3605	A high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers	398.8433837890625
1225/3605	He gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he	195.80563354492188
1226/3605	Not the least noise was to be heard it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the	73.08942413330078
1227/3605	DArtagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind	95.68014526367188
1228/3605	The appointed hour was about to	306.9862060546875
1229/3605	In fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of	127.85147094726562
1230/3605	Cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous	1156.17138671875
1231/3605	There was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young	364.3631286621094
1232/3605	His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first	74.33155059814453
1233/3605	Through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the	436.4999694824219
1234/3605	There could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty M	1244.677490234375
1235/3605	This time without knowing why DArtagnan felt a cold shiver run through his	98.45120239257812
1236/3605	Perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral	427.4977722167969
1237/3605	Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o	217.86399841308594
1238/3605	He drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o	56.01011276245117
1239/3605	He went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this	264.9616394042969
1240/3605	DArtagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to M	257.26397705078125
1241/3605	He clapped his hands three timesthe ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an	728.1798706054688
1242/3605	He then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for	166.77256774902344
1243/3605	He approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and DArtagnan could get no	98.57906341552734
1244/3605	At that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pav	175.7140655517578
1245/3605	Besides DArtagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy	191.1163787841797
1246/3605	In an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pav	158.5176544189453
1247/3605	It was a strange thing and one which made DArtagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful	220.14620971679688
1248/3605	One of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its	129.98049926757812
1249/3605	A table which had been covered with an elegant supper was	372.08673095703125
1250/3605	The decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the	795.4840698242188
1251/3605	Everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate	607.2495727539062
1252/3605	DArtagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the	807.7756958007812
1253/3605	He hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of	102.5906982421875
1254/3605	The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the	133.77919006347656
1255/3605	DArtagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarkedfor nothing had led him to the examinationthat the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and	452.61041259765625
1256/3605	Besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from Paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward	124.62268829345703
1257/3605	At length DArtagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a womans torn	259.8985290527344
1258/3605	This glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable	1758.8885498046875
1259/3605	It was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty	257.57147216796875
1260/3605	As DArtagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and	825.5084838867188
1261/3605	And yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with M	449.1050720214844
1262/3605	Bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in Paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her	72.97161865234375
1263/3605	But all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over	1011.9797973632812
1264/3605	He ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boat	277.4603576660156
1265/3605	There were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to	230.69837951660156
1266/3605	Cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet DArtagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was M	127.56678009033203
1267/3605	DArtagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of M	153.62974548339844
1268/3605	Bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at	127.1860122680664
1269/3605	Cloud and not elsewhere before the DEstréess pavilion and not in another	2275.569580078125
1270/3605	Everything conspired to prove to DArtagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had	70.52754974365234
1271/3605	He again ran back to the châte	55.127689361572266
1272/3605	It appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited	100.88298034667969
1273/3605	The lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the	325.95672607421875
1274/3605	DArtagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its	437.0875244140625
1275/3605	The gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chainedup dog went up to the	171.90159606933594
1276/3605	No one answered to his first	708.7249755859375
1277/3605	A silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked	134.05294799804688
1278/3605	It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise withina timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be	197.40902709960938
1279/3605	Then DArtagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most	232.030517578125
1280/3605	At length an old wormeaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of DArtagn	631.0416870117188
1281/3605	Nevertheless rapid as the movement had been DArtagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old	55.29520797729492
1282/3605	In the name of heaven cried he listen to me I have been waiting for someone who has not	54.56425094604492
1283/3605	Has anything particular happened in the neighborhood Speak   The window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than	200.6641082763672
1284/3605	DArtagnan related his story simply with the omission of	450.8944396972656
1285/3605	He told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the	151.65481567382812
1286/3605	The old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when DArtagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing	95.43041229248047
1287/3605	In the name of heaven explain yourself   Oh Monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if I dared tell you what I have seen certainly no good would befall	88.79996490478516
1288/3605	You have then seen something replied DArtagn	44.695980072021484
1289/3605	In that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my	85.8514633178711
1290/3605	As I am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed I went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from	78.47612762451172
1291/3605	In the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddleh	231.7706756591797
1292/3605	These horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as caval	209.13768005371094
1293/3605	Ah my worthy gentlemen cried I what do you want You must have a ladder said he who appeared to be the leader of the	76.21331787109375
1294/3605	Yes monsieur the one with which I gather my	136.7137908935547
1295/3605	Lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused	127.41321563720703
1296/3605	Only remember thisif you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen I am quite sure however we may threaten you you are	125.45077514648438
1297/3605	At these words he threw me a crown which I picked up and he took the	115.30805206298828
1298/3605	After shutting the gate behind them I pretended to return to the house but I immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge I gained yonder clump of elder from which I could hear and see	192.5531463623047
1299/3605	The little old man remained at the coach door the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the saddleh	121.15977478027344
1300/3605	All at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the	61.274986267089844
1301/3605	Then I saw no more but I heard the noise of breaking	92.4240951538086
1302/3605	The woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon st	962.94384765625
1303/3605	Two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after	111.78837585449219
1304/3605	The leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the	117.4351577758789
1305/3605	His two companions were already on horse	77.76263427734375
1306/3605	He sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was	107.61178588867188
1307/3605	From that moment I have neither seen nor heard	113.9212646484375
1308/3605	DArtagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his	216.1127166748047
1309/3605	But my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and thats a	315.9288330078125
1310/3605	Can you guess said DArtagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition   I dont know	65.88102722167969
1311/3605	But as you spoke to him you must have seen	32.088409423828125
1312/3605	Oh its a description you want   Exactly	316.911376953125
1313/3605	A tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a	640.6705322265625
1314/3605	Thats the man cried DArtagnan again he forever he He is my demon	337.04266357421875
1315/3605	And the other   Which   The short	87.56607055664062
1316/3605	Oh he was not a gentleman Ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small	215.25221252441406
1317/3605	Poor woman poor woman what have they done with you   You have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old	44.401031494140625
1318/3605	A gentleman has but his word and I have given you	115.72895050048828
1319/3605	With a heavy heart DArtagnan again bent his way toward the	80.43978118896484
1320/3605	Sometimes he hoped it could not be M	1267.3651123046875
1321/3605	Bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the Louvre sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her	217.48184204101562
1322/3605	His mind was torn by doubt grief and	806.0296630859375
1323/3605	Oh if I had my three friends here cried he I should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them   It was past midnight the next thing was to find Planc	82.22905731201172
1324/3605	DArtagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find Planchet in any of	96.23236846923828
1325/3605	At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather	719.1717529296875
1326/3605	DArtagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was	39.129981994628906
1327/3605	Besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious	129.6328125
1328/3605	He was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or	191.2138214111328
1329/3605	DArtagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest	938.5082397460938
1330/3605	Toward six oclock DArtagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad	522.03759765625
1331/3605	He was not long in making his	157.66941833496094
1332/3605	The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest Planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which DArtagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its	166.95350646972656
1333/3605	PORTHOS     Instead of returning directly home DArtagnan alighted at the door of	68.00814056396484
1334/3605	de Tréville and ran quickly up the	99.13411712646484
1335/3605	This time he had decided to relate all that had	117.03970336914062
1336/3605	de Tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole	124.44994354248047
1337/3605	de Tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her	238.75027465820312
1338/3605	de Tréville listened to the young mans account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love	238.78749084472656
1339/3605	When DArtagnan had finished he said Hum All this savors of his Eminence a league	316.36541748046875
1340/3605	But what is to be done said DArtagn	12.089150428771973
1341/3605	Nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting Paris as I told you as soon as	215.04129028320312
1342/3605	I will see the queen I will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt	75.69839477539062
1343/3605	These details will guide her on her part and on your return I shall perhaps have some good news to tell	164.28607177734375
1344/3605	DArtagnan knew that although a Gascon	45.24625778198242
1345/3605	de Tréville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his	94.5305404663086
1346/3605	He bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant	156.8755645751953
1347/3605	Determined to put the advice of	140.62535095214844
1348/3605	de Tréville in practice instantly DArtagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his val	204.55104064941406
1349/3605	On approaching the house he perceived	206.34132385253906
1350/3605	Bonacieux in morning costume standing at his	584.5548095703125
1351/3605	All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of DArtagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done	43.67906951904297
1352/3605	In fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental DArtagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his count	933.9743041992188
1353/3605	A rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good	207.66815185546875
1354/3605	All falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true	460.1189270019531
1355/3605	It appeared then to DArtagnan that	38.72504425048828
1356/3605	Bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look	304.054931640625
1357/3605	In consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before	45.857364654541016
1358/3605	Well young man said he we appear to pass rather gay nights Seven oclock in the morning _Peste_ You seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going	366.7595520019531
1359/3605	No one can reproach you for anything of the kind Monsieur Bonacieux said the young man you are a model for regular	76.70374298095703
1360/3605	It is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness	232.63784790039062
1361/3605	Happiness comes to meet him does it not Monsieur Bonacieux   Bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly	206.32666015625
1362/3605	Ah ah said Bonacieux you are a jocular companion But where the devil were you gadding last night my young master It does not appear to be very clean in the cross	589.0850219726562
1363/3605	DArtagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud	458.0434875488281
1364/3605	Both were stained with splashes of mud of the same	5811.36669921875
1365/3605	Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of DArtagn	33.56170654296875
1366/3605	That little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was Bonacieux	1166.60205078125
1367/3605	The husband had presided at the abduction of his	644.8529052734375
1368/3605	A terrible inclination seized DArtagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained	150.750244140625
1369/3605	Ah but you are joking my worthy man said DArtagn	33.83189392089844
1370/3605	It appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a	969.6512451171875
1371/3605	May you not have been philandering a little also Monsieur Bonacieux Oh the devil Thats unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as	504.0417785644531
1372/3605	Oh Lord no said Bonacieux but yesterday I went to	695.1465454101562
1373/3605	Mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as I cannot possibly do without one and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud which I have not yet had time to	184.58544921875
1374/3605	The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions DArtagnan had	115.42308044433594
1375/3605	Bonacieux had named Mandé because Mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from	3392.50537109375
1376/3605	This probability afforded him his first	6273.5087890625
1377/3605	If Bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret	418.6133728027344
1378/3605	The question then was how to change this probability into a	947.8082275390625
1379/3605	Pardon my dear Monsieur Bonacieux if I dont stand upon ceremony said DArtagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of	139.84185791015625
1380/3605	Allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment you know that is never refused among	172.1428985595703
1381/3605	Without waiting for the permission of his host DArtagnan went quickly into the house and cast a rapid glance at the	39.67981719970703
1382/3605	He had only been back an hour or two he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first	224.7792205810547
1383/3605	Thanks Monsieur Bonacieux said DArtagnan emptying his glass that is all I wanted of	43.11076736450195
1384/3605	I will now go up into my	86.07108306884766
1385/3605	I will make Planchet brush my boots and when he has done I will if you like send him to you to brush your	196.74285888671875
1386/3605	He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsider	515.3052978515625
1387/3605	At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great	40.482635498046875
1388/3605	Ah monsieur cried Planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more	38.1705436706543
1389/3605	I thought you would never come	83.35778045654297
1390/3605	Whats the matter now Planchet demanded DArtagn	82.90857696533203
1391/3605	Oh I give you a hundred I give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit I received in your	55.76097869873047
1392/3605	When   About half an hour ago while you were at Monsieur de Trév	61.71371078491211
1393/3605	Monsieur de Cavois   In	619.7634887695312
1394/3605	The captain of the cardinals Guards  	369.2978515625
1395/3605	Did he come to arrest me   I have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling	96.82581329345703
1396/3605	Was he so sweet then   Indeed he was all honey monsie	195.90174865722656
1397/3605	Indeed   He came he said on the part of his Eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the Palais	142.42092895507812
1398/3605	It was called the PalaisCardinal before Richelieu gave it to the	661.430419921875
1399/3605	What did you answer him   That the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could	83.0758056640625
1400/3605	The snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal replied the young man	304.0856628417969
1401/3605	Oh I saw the snare and I answered you would be quite in despair on your	103.16072082519531
1402/3605	Where has he gone asked Monsieur de Cav	827.7703247070312
1403/3605	And when did he set out   Yesterday	143.49319458007812
1404/3605	Planchet my friend interrupted DArtagnan you are really a precious	43.17250061035156
1405/3605	You will understand monsieur I thought there would be still time if you wish to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet	89.8858413696289
1406/3605	The falsehood would then lie at my door and as I am not a gentleman I may be allowed to	144.86605834960938
1407/3605	Be of good heart Planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious	351.3688049316406
1408/3605	In a quarter of an hour we set	21.72903823852539
1409/3605	Thats the advice I was about to give Monsieur and where are we going may I ask without being too curious   _Pardieu_ In the opposite direction to that which you said I was	79.42117309570312
1410/3605	Indeed I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of	493.1805419921875
1411/3605	So then   So then pack up our luggage Planchet and let us be	184.52113342285156
1412/3605	On my part I will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be	73.2579116821289
1413/3605	You may join me at the Hôtel des Gard	157.33334350585938
1414/3605	By the way Planchet I think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low w	129.7019500732422
1415/3605	Ah monsieur you may take my word when I tell you	25.870485305786133
1416/3605	I am a physiognomist I assure	81.29447174072266
1417/3605	DArtagnan went out first as had been agreed	45.10573196411133
1418/3605	Then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three	69.21961212158203
1419/3605	No news had been received of them only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for Aram	368.6783447265625
1420/3605	Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the Hôtel des Gard	83.26927185058594
1421/3605	DArtagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse	61.04450988769531
1422/3605	Thats well said he to Planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the	89.77399444580078
1423/3605	Do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece said Planchet with his shrewd	198.72625732421875
1424/3605	No Monsieur Jester replied DArtagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them	117.54949951171875
1425/3605	Which is a great chance replied Planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of	71.99400329589844
1426/3605	Amen said DArtagnan getting into his	50.595298767089844
1427/3605	As they went from the Hôtel des Gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit Paris by the Barrière de la Villette and the other by the Barrière Montmartre to meet again beyond	163.22894287109375
1428/3605	Denisa strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate	1547.5223388671875
1429/3605	Planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by	149.6146240234375
1430/3605	His natural prudence however never forsook him for a single	474.5263977050781
1431/3605	He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an	157.3060302734375
1432/3605	It followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from DArtagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no	131.2921142578125
1433/3605	Nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of Great	217.99266052246094
1434/3605	Martin the same at which they had stopped on their first	155.48040771484375
1435/3605	The host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the	188.910888671875
1436/3605	Now as they had already traveled eleven leagues DArtagnan thought it time to stop whether Porthos were or were not in the	113.49254608154297
1437/3605	Perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the Musket	66.31695556640625
1438/3605	DArtagnan was therefore served with miraculous cel	367.5731506347656
1439/3605	The regiment of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and DArtagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a	194.5831756591797
1440/3605	The host desired himself to serve him which DArtagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following	220.77578735351562
1441/3605	Take your glass then and let us	122.65643310546875
1442/3605	But what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility Let us drink to the prosperity of your	399.1483459472656
1443/3605	Your Lordship does me much honor said the host and I thank you sincerely for your kind	415.3580627441406
1444/3605	But dont mistake said DArtagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may thinkfor it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well	311.114501953125
1445/3605	In hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his	1364.3316650390625
1446/3605	Now I travel a great deal particularly on this road and I wish to see all innkeepers making a	233.72727966308594
1447/3605	It seems to me said the host that this is not the first time I have had the honor of seeing Monsie	14.161725997924805
1448/3605	Bah I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly and out of the ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at	139.3793182373047
1449/3605	Why I was here only ten or twelve days	131.8380889892578
1450/3605	I was conducting some friends Musketeers one of whom by the by had a dispute with a strangera man who sought a quarrel with him for I dont know	193.5628204345703
1451/3605	Exactly so said the host I remember it	83.86074829101562
1452/3605	It is not Monsieur Porthos that your Lordship means   Yes that is my companions	111.7083969116211
1453/3605	My God my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him   Your Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his	173.07272338867188
1454/3605	Why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of	56.41810989379883
1455/3605	He has done us the honor to remain	66.9837875366211
1456/3605	What he had done you the honor to remain here   Yes monsieur in this house and we are even a little uneasy   On what account   Of certain expenses he has	58.138084411621094
1457/3605	Well but whatever expenses he may have incurred I am sure he is in a condition to pay	156.73377990722656
1458/3605	Ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my	1531.3504638671875
1459/3605	We have made considerable advances and this very morning the surgeon declared that if Monsieur Porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was I who had sent for	77.72749328613281
1460/3605	Porthos is wounded then   I cannot tell you monsie	24.69667625427246
1461/3605	What You cannot tell me Surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other	67.87349700927734
1462/3605	Yes but in our situation we must not say all we knowparticularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our	371.30670166015625
1463/3605	Well can I see Porthos   Certainly monsie	22.989727020263672
1464/3605	Take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at Number	751.8359375
1465/3605	Only warn him that it is	129.2360382080078
1466/3605	Why should I do that   Because monsieur some mischief might happen to	80.99958801269531
1467/3605	Of what kind in the name of wonder   Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your	96.25178527832031
1468/3605	What have you done to him then   We have asked him for	59.943092346191406
1469/3605	The devil Ah I can understand	320.3519287109375
1470/3605	It is a demand that Porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but I know he must be so at	106.68055725097656
1471/3605	As our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the	272.9079895019531
1472/3605	It is true he had been playing the day	77.5047607421875
1473/3605	Playing the day before And with whom   Lord who can say monsieur With some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet	162.84645080566406
1474/3605	When we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to	287.70916748046875
1475/3605	We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentlemans word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be	72.46007537841797
1476/3605	This reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his	228.6883544921875
1477/3605	Since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his	113.53980255126953
1478/3605	What Mousqueton is here then   Oh yes monsie	13.759797096252441
1479/3605	Five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition	143.79635620117188
1480/3605	It appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his	1189.3077392578125
1481/3605	Unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at	190.84971618652344
1482/3605	The fact is said DArtagnan I have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in Mousqu	46.323307037353516
1483/3605	That is possible monsieur but suppose I should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy I should be a ruined man   No for Porthos will pay	92.87263488769531
1484/3605	Hum said the host in a doubtful	129.99705505371094
1485/3605	The favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes	160.49745178222656
1486/3605	If I durst say what I believe on that head   What you believe   I ought rather to say what I	112.39877319335938
1487/3605	What you know   And even what I am sure	36.17097854614258
1488/3605	And of what are you so sure   I would say that I know this great	56.567935943603516
1489/3605	And how do you know her   Oh monsieur if I could believe I might trust in your	67.27584838867188
1490/3605	Speak By the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your	166.82037353515625
1491/3605	Well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many	79.32442474365234
1492/3605	What have you done   Oh nothing which was not right in the character of a	74.37956237792969
1493/3605	Well   Monsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the	58.82891845703125
1494/3605	As he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this	105.26187133789062
1495/3605	And then   Instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe I took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess	91.33451843261719
1496/3605	This was fulfilling the intentions of Monsieur Porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not   Nearly	52.00762176513672
1497/3605	Well monsieur do you know who this great lady is   No I have heard Porthos speak of her thats	53.02919387817383
1498/3605	Do you know who this pretended duchess is   I repeat to you I dont know	61.35392379760742
1499/3605	Why she is the old wife of a procurator of the Châtelet monsieur named Madame Coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous	658.12109375
1500/3605	It struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the Rue aux O	871.582763671875
1501/3605	Has he been wounded then   Oh good Lord What have I said   You said that Porthos had received a sword	81.63058471679688
1502/3605	Yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say	90.6697769165039
1503/3605	Zounds monsieur Because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his	391.0234680175781
1504/3605	As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his	139.1211700439453
1505/3605	It is a wound that confines him to his bed   Ah and a master stroke too I assure	344.20587158203125
1506/3605	Your friends soul must stick tight to his	5012.5263671875
1507/3605	Were you there then   Monsieur I followed them from curiosity so that I saw the combat without the combatants seeing	144.32177734375
1508/3605	And what took place   Oh The affair was not long I assure	108.18814086914062
1509/3605	They placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when Monsieur Porthos came to the _parade_ he had already three inches of steel in his	132.5450897216797
1510/3605	The stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and Monsieur Porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself	116.28321075439453
1511/3605	Upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was Porthos and not DArtagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and	80.29508209228516
1512/3605	So it was with Monsieur dArtagnan this stranger meant to quarrel   It appears	36.80571365356445
1513/3605	And do you know what has become of him   No I never saw him until that moment and have not seen him	33.43782424926758
1514/3605	Very well I know all that I wish to	25.677043914794922
1515/3605	Porthoss chamber is you say on the first story Number One   Yes monsieur the handsomest in the inna chamber that I could have let ten times	305.4728698730469
1516/3605	Bah Be satisfied said DArtagnan laughing Porthos will pay you with the money of the Duchess Coquen	117.0811767578125
1517/3605	And did you convey this answer to your guest   We took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his	214.5855712890625
1518/3605	So that he still expects his money   Oh Lord yes monsieur Yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the	166.9469757080078
1519/3605	Do you say the procurators wife is old and ugly   Fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to Pathauds	552.8587646484375
1520/3605	In that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be	100.48368072509766
1521/3605	How not much Twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the	1432.6976318359375
1522/3605	He denies himself nothing it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live	344.0836181640625
1523/3605	Never mind if his mistress abandons him he will find friends I will answer for	269.3650207519531
1524/3605	So my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation	238.4932403564453
1525/3605	Monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurators wife and not to say a word of the wound   Thats agreed you have my	134.8588409423828
1526/3605	Oh he would kill me   Dont be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he	63.265506744384766
1527/3605	Saying these words DArtagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interestedhis debt and his	144.29454040527344
1528/3605	At the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number	354.13494873046875
1529/3605	DArtagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the	123.0039291381836
1530/3605	In addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty	335.7770080566406
1531/3605	At the sight of his friend Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy and Mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular	127.58831787109375
1532/3605	Ah _pardieu_ Is that you said Porthos to DArtagn	15.143949508666992
1533/3605	Excuse my not coming to meet you but added he looking at DArtagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me  	35.31907272338867
1534/3605	Has the host told you nothing then   I asked after you and came up as soon as I	74.07764434814453
1535/3605	And what has happened to you my dear Porthos continued DArtagn	10.631976127624512
1536/3605	Why on making a thrust at my adversary whom I had already hit three times and whom I meant to finish with the fourth I put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my	332.7456359863281
1537/3605	Truly   Honor Luckily for the rascal for I should have left him dead on the spot I assure	289.7235412597656
1538/3605	And what has became of him   Oh I dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the	54.39638137817383
1539/3605	But you my dear DArtagnan what has happened to you   So that this strain of the knee continued DArtagnan my dear Porthos keeps you in bed   My God thats	34.69361877441406
1540/3605	I shall be about again in a few	63.95049285888672
1541/3605	Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris You must be cruelly bored	196.88148498535156
1542/3605	That was my intention but my dear friend I have one thing to confess to	58.196685791015625
1543/3605	He accepted my challenge and my faith my seventyfive pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the	412.6460266113281
1544/3605	But you my dear DArtagnan   What can you expect my dear Porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said DArtagn	21.035816192626953
1545/3605	You know the proverb Unlucky at play lucky in	8751.0263671875
1546/3605	You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its	287.4259948730469
1547/3605	I wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which I stood absolutely in need on account of my	192.97808837890625
1548/3605	Well   Well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered	130.986328125
1549/3605	Truly   No so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the	332.635986328125
1550/3605	But you are here my dear fellow let us speak of	22.865257263183594
1551/3605	I confess I began to be very uneasy on your	87.30278015136719
1552/3605	But your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear Porthos said DArtagnan directing the sick mans attention to the full stewpans and the empty	253.25929260253906
1553/3605	So you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position I am armed to the	330.9497985839844
1554/3605	And yet said DArtagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties	84.9432373046875
1555/3605	And he again pointed to the bottles and the stewp	728.1204833984375
1556/3605	This miserable strain confines me to my bed but Mousqueton forages and brings in	1318.365234375
1557/3605	Friend Mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of	153.48658752441406
1558/3605	Mousqueton said DArtagnan you must render me a	28.96613121032715
1559/3605	What monsieur   You must give your recipe to Planc	36.3387336730957
1560/3605	I may be besieged in my turn and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your	48.656734466552734
1561/3605	Lord monsieur There is nothing more easy said Mousqueton with a modest	40.78168487548828
1562/3605	One only needs to be sharp thats	440.1624755859375
1563/3605	I was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a po	275.3747863769531
1564/3605	And what did he do the rest of his time   Monsieur he carried on a trade which I have always thought	100.2616958618164
1565/3605	Now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a Catholic coming alone the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in his	908.716064453125
1566/3605	He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the travelers abandoning his purse to save his	156.6959686279297
1567/3605	It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy	198.99432373046875
1568/3605	For my part monsieur I am Catholicmy father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a Huguen	952.9481201171875
1569/3605	And what was the end of this worthy man asked DArtagn	25.38538932800293
1570/3605	Oh of the most unfortunate kind monsie	46.99542236328125
1571/3605	One day he was surprised in a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a	606.2401123046875
1572/3605	Then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and I were	402.96929931640625
1573/3605	And what did you do said DArtagn	11.120044708251953
1574/3605	We let them tell their story out replied Mousqu	229.13172912597656
1575/3605	Then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the Catholic and I on that of the Huguen	525.466064453125
1576/3605	Two hours after all was over we had done the business of both admiring the foresight of our poor father who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different	125.23878479003906
1577/3605	Well I must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent	109.35235595703125
1578/3605	And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher   Yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a	145.6756134033203
1579/3605	The consequence is that when I saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours I had recourse to a little of my old	544.441162109375
1580/3605	While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince I laid a few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his Highnesss pieces of water I slipped a few lines into his fish	354.0934143066406
1581/3605	So that now thanks be to God we do not want as Monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eelsall light wholesome food suitable for the	2087.62646484375
1582/3605	But the wine said DArtagnan who furnishes the wine Your host   That is to say yes and	120.57933044433594
1583/3605	How yes and no   He furnishes it it is true but he does not know that he has that	94.74652099609375
1584/3605	Explain yourself Mousqueton your conversation is full of instructive	807.6975708007812
1585/3605	It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in my peregrinations who had seen many countries and among them the New	971.9314575195312
1586/3605	What connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   Patience monsieur everything will come in its	345.0345764160156
1587/3605	This Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in his voyage to	214.530029296875
1588/3605	This lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between	3026.6513671875
1589/3605	My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running no	224.14837646484375
1590/3605	I practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the	469.9350891113281
1591/3605	Well do you understand monsieur Our host has a wellfurnished cellar the key of which never leaves him only this cellar has a ventilating	1046.56640625
1592/3605	Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso and as I now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine thats my point for	611.8056640625
1593/3605	You see monsieur what the New World has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the	570.2073974609375
1594/3605	Now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it   Thank you my friend thank you unfortunately I have just breakfast	135.8410186767578
1595/3605	Well said Porthos arrange the table Mousqueton and while we breakfast DArtagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left	65.46253967285156
1596/3605	But there the confidence of DArtagnan	41.381160736083984
1597/3605	He only added that on his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent horsesone for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the	192.5022735595703
1598/3605	At this moment Planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at Clerm	144.1385040283203
1599/3605	For the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if Porthos were still at the Great	169.12548828125
1600/3605	Martin he would call for him on his	78.57591247558594

1754/3605	What do you mean by tetragones asked DArtagnan uneas	207.31858825683594

1914/3605	Do you remember how he cried On DArtagnan on I am taken And when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword One might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were	233.8189239501953
1915/3605	These words redoubled the eagerness of DArtagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid	184.8474884033203
1916/3605	About eleven oclock in the morning they perceived Amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed	103.65172576904297
1917/3605	DArtagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped	589.8167114257812
1918/3605	He entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right	157.83445739746094
1919/3605	Do you remember me said he to the host who advanced to greet	96.84709930419922
1920/3605	I have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which DArtagnan	69.81687927246094
1921/3605	What you dont know me   No monseign	22.968276977539062
1922/3605	Well two words will refresh your	596.6907348632812
1923/3605	Ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice	208.43153381347656
1924/3605	Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his arm	493.80670166015625
1925/3605	Here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for I now recollect	133.6678009033203
1926/3605	It was you who rode off at the moment I had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak	148.3586883544922
1927/3605	Yes it was I so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole	85.43821716308594
1928/3605	Condescend to listen to me and you shall know	229.772216796875
1929/3605	I had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as Guards or Musket	803.385498046875
1930/3605	Monseigneur I was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenancesnothing was	321.40875244140625
1931/3605	Go on go on said DArtagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had	173.2232208251953
1932/3605	I took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as I thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coin	203.10374450683594
1933/3605	Again said DArtagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word _coiners	995.5639038085938
1934/3605	Pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my	229.16856384277344
1935/3605	The authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the	211.77322387695312
1936/3605	But once again that gentlemanwhere is he What has become of him Is he dead Is he living   Patience monseigneur we are coming to	150.652099609375
1937/3605	There happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape DArtagnan appeared to authorize the	258.6971130371094
1938/3605	That gentleman your friend defended himself	11805.5791015625
1939/3605	Alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon	60.24164581298828
1940/3605	As we were sure of finding him there we left him	231.16758728027344
1941/3605	Yes said DArtagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison	41.37870788574219
1942/3605	Good God To imprison him monseigneur Why he imprisoned himself I swear to you he	369.8885498046875
1943/3605	In the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely	193.82762145996094
1944/3605	The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and I have heard nothing of either of them	96.58721923828125
1945/3605	As for myself as soon as I recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor to whom I related all that had passed and asked what I should do with my	143.64093017578125
1946/3605	He told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders I had received did not come from him and that if I had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me	93.22919464111328
1947/3605	It appears that I had made a mistake monsieur that I had arrested the wrong person and that he whom I ought to have arrested had	60.102256774902344
1948/3605	Ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil To my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own	94.67615509033203
1949/3605	I told him very humblyfor I could not conceal from myself the scrape I had got into by laying hands on one of his Majestys MusketeersI told him I was quite ready to submit to his	306.1958923339844
1950/3605	In the first place said he I wish my lackey placed with me fully	183.25497436523438
1951/3605	We hastened to obey this order for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could	79.88945007324219
1952/3605	But where is Athos now cried DArtagn	22.895235061645508
1953/3605	Where is Athos   In the cellar monsie	26.886436462402344
1954/3605	What you scoundrel Have you kept him in the cellar all this time   Merciful heaven No monsieur We keep him in the cellar You do not know what he is about in the	129.40228271484375
1955/3605	We every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it but alas It is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest	428.9773864746094
1956/3605	I once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible	254.6020965576172
1957/3605	I heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musket	804.3724975585938
1958/3605	Then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the	217.83067321777344
1959/3605	Upon this I went and complained to the governor who replied that I only had what I deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my	193.5118865966797
1960/3605	So that since that time replied DArtagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the	205.04457092285156
1961/3605	So from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the	72.52246856689453
1962/3605	There is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and saus	2228.55322265625
1963/3605	And as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to	263.5574035644531
1964/3605	If your friend remains another week in my cellar I shall be a ruined	296.0775451660156
1965/3605	And not more than justice either you ass Could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coinerssay   Yes monsieur you are right said the	247.65634155273438
1966/3605	But hark hark There he is   Somebody has disturbed him without doubt said DArtagn	187.49502563476562
1967/3605	But he must be disturbed cried the host Here are two English gentlemen just	361.5964050292969
1968/3605	Well   Well the English like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the	99.80559539794922
1969/3605	My wife has perhaps requested permission of Monsieur Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has	188.01348876953125
1970/3605	Ah good heaven There is the hullabaloo louder than ever   DArtagnan in fact heard a great noise on the side next the	316.41021728515625
1971/3605	He rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by Planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of	121.81343841552734
1972/3605	The two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and	311.5081481933594
1973/3605	One might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogresthe gigantic heroes of popular legends into whose cavern nobody could force their way with	1627.951416015625
1974/3605	There was a moment of silence but at length the two Englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a	277.3327331542969
1975/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan cocking his pistols I will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one	64.61126708984375
1976/3605	Ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have	279.8048400878906
1977/3605	Good God cried the hollow voice of Athos I can hear DArtagnan I	50.63829803466797
1978/3605	Yes cried DArtagnan raising his voice in turn I am here my	34.74928283691406
1979/3605	Ah good then replied Athos we will teach them these door breakers   The gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two	228.4470672607422
1980/3605	They still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to	1810.6790771484375
1981/3605	Stand on one side DArtagnan stand on one side cried Ath	45.51255416870117
1982/3605	I am going to fire   Gentlemen exclaimed DArtagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are	74.53297424316406
1983/3605	Patience Athos You are running your heads into a very silly affair you will be	1146.5599365234375
1984/3605	My lackey and I will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the	140.433837890625
1985/3605	You will then have our swords with which I can assure you my friend and I can play tolerably	84.66873931884766
1986/3605	Let me conduct your business and my	181.46238708496094
1987/3605	You shall soon have something to drink I give you my	81.58163452148438
1988/3605	If there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of Ath	549.3134155273438
1989/3605	The host felt a cold sweat creep down his	827.3831787109375
1990/3605	How If there is any left murmured	175.2104034423828
1991/3605	What the devil There must be plenty left replied DArtagn	176.4575653076172
1992/3605	Be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the	333.223388671875
1993/3605	Gentlemen return your swords to their scabb	1380.7623291015625
1994/3605	Well provided you replace your pistols in your	919.0455322265625
1995/3605	Then turning toward Planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musket	389.2782897949219
1996/3605	The Englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumbling	2404.8974609375
1997/3605	The history of Athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the	180.34701538085938
1998/3605	Now gentlemen said DArtagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes I will answer for it you shall have all you	38.001609802246094
1999/3605	Now I am alone my dear Athos said DArtagnan open the door I beg of	20.245454788208008
2000/3605	Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos which the besieged himself	789.118896484375
2001/3605	An instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of Athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the	129.49339294433594
2002/3605	DArtagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tender	27.73442268371582
2003/3605	He then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that Athos	126.1373519897461
2004/3605	I am dead drunk thats all and never did a man more strongly set about getting	741.9978637695312
2005/3605	By the Lord my good host I must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty	213.2827911376953
2006/3605	Mercy cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master I am a ruined	149.96438598632812
2007/3605	He would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the c	104.18997955322266
2008/3605	Hark I dont think he put the faucet in	1551.885009765625
2009/3605	Do you hear it It is running	450.45947265625
2010/3605	DArtagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning	133.9545440673828
2011/3605	In the meantime Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head	110.71028900146484
2012/3605	Like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of Rub	3409.361328125
2013/3605	He was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive	1506.29833984375
2014/3605	The four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which DArtagnan occupied with	102.21427154541016
2015/3605	In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited	228.98614501953125
2016/3605	The image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of	600.2667236328125
2017/3605	Of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten	9682.9462890625
2018/3605	Then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the	146.1565399169922
2019/3605	Athos did not even turn his	179.12120056152344
2020/3605	The host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two	202.29098510742188
2021/3605	Some wine said Athos on perceiving the	45.87129592895508
2022/3605	Some wine cried the stupefied host some wine Why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth I am a ruined man lost destroyed   Bah said Athos we were always	160.59628295898438
2023/3605	If you had been contented with drinking well and good but you have broken all the	179.69985961914062
2024/3605	You pushed me upon a heap which rolled	520.0980224609375
2025/3605	All my oil is lost   Oil is a sovereign balm for wounds and my poor Grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on	983.0086059570312
2026/3605	All my sausages are gnawed   There is an enormous quantity of rats in that	724.38525390625
2027/3605	You shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated	510.0703125
2028/3605	Triple ass said Athos rising but he sank down again	287.6486511230469
2029/3605	He had tried his strength to the	100.56157684326172
2030/3605	DArtagnan came to his relief with his whip in his	31.293283462524414
2031/3605	The host drew back and burst into	280.5587463378906
2032/3605	This will teach you said DArtagnan to treat the guests God sends you in a more courteous	128.35487365722656
2033/3605	God Say the devil   My dear friend said DArtagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you	67.57075500488281
2034/3605	Oh gentlemen said the host I have been	76.80883026123047
2035/3605	I confess it but pardon to every sin You are gentlemen and I am a poor inn	260.69189453125
2036/3605	Ah if you speak in that way said Athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the c	85.5099868774414
2037/3605	We are not such devils as we appear to	265.68658447265625
2038/3605	Come hither I say and dont be afraid continued Ath	211.38833618164062
2039/3605	At the very moment when I was about to pay you I had placed my purse on the	49.23971939086914
2040/3605	That purse contained sixty pistoles where is it   Deposited with the justice they said it was bad	1019.4918823242188
2041/3605	Very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pist	500.54058837890625
2042/3605	But Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold	508.6884765625
2043/3605	If it were bad money there might be some hopes but unfortunately those were all good	536.9360961914062
2044/3605	Manage the matter as well as you can my good man it does not concern me the more so as I have not a livre	139.53326416015625
2045/3605	Come said DArtagnan let us inquire	32.06938171386719
2046/3605	Athoss horse where is that   In the	241.4335479736328
2047/3605	How much is it worth   Fifty pistoles at	257.9917297363281
2048/3605	Take it and there ends the	1253.561279296875
2049/3605	What cried Athos are you selling my horsemy Bajazet And pray upon what shall I make my campaign upon Grimaud   I have brought you another said DArtagn	228.24790954589844
2050/3605	Another   And a magnificent one cried the	78.75202178955078
2051/3605	Well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us	273.2939758300781
2052/3605	What asked the host quite cheerful	855.8733520507812
2053/3605	Some of that at the bottom near the l	697.4820556640625
2054/3605	There are twentyfive bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my	409.5087890625
2055/3605	Why this man is a cask said the host	149.64096069335938
2056/3605	If he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks I shall soon reestablish my	1923.8951416015625
2057/3605	And dont forget said DArtagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two English	133.22244262695312
2058/3605	As he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the	225.12794494628906
2059/3605	Thats well said Athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to Porthos and Aramis But you DArtagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally You have a sad	44.42375564575195
2060/3605	Alas said DArtagnan it is because I am the most	25.772193908691406
2061/3605	Presently And why presently Because you think I am drunk DArtagnan remember this My ideas are never so clear as when I have had plenty of	338.91387939453125
2062/3605	Athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said Trifles only trifles That was his favorite	731.9890747070312
2063/3605	You always say _trifles_ my dear Athos said DArtagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never	119.26390075683594
2064/3605	The drinkdeadened eye of Athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as	785.6965942382812
2065/3605	Thats true said he quietly for my part I have never	119.5335922241211
2066/3605	Acknowledge then you stony heart said DArtagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender	145.1034698486328
2067/3605	What do you say   I say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death You are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear DArtagn	144.53582763671875
2068/3605	Except you Athos who never had	113.80138397216797

2072/3605	Not a bad idea said Athos emptying and refilling his	506.07244873046875
2073/3605	Athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so DArtagnan saw that he became	100.62047576904297
2074/3605	He was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to	291.91455078125
2075/3605	He kept himself upright and dreamed without	1820.376708984375
2076/3605	This somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in	3506.11181640625
2077/3605	Through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the	448.0911865234375
2078/3605	She lived in a small town with her brother who was a cur	155.7993927001953
2079/3605	Both had recently come into the	201.9491424560547
2080/3605	They came nobody knew whence but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they	1609.048095703125
2081/3605	They were said however to be of good	1661.1336669921875
2082/3605	My friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his willfor he was	276.14703369140625
2083/3605	Who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown persons Unfortunately he was an honorable man he married	223.34083557128906
2084/3605	The fool The ass The idiot   How so if he loved her asked DArtagn	188.0811004638672
2085/3605	He took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becoming	224.76422119140625
2086/3605	Well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued Athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and f	111.14031982421875
2087/3605	The count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her	418.0731506347656
2088/3605	DArtagnan said Athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her	198.1782684326172
2089/3605	Athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his	122.7340087890625
2090/3605	What do you tell me   Truth my	59.3551025390625
2091/3605	The angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a	648.3549194335938
2092/3605	And what did the count do   The count was of the highest	65.00621032714844
2093/3605	He had on his estates the rights of high and low tribun	1189.785888671875
2094/3605	He tore the dress of the countess to pieces he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a	275.13787841796875
2095/3605	No less said Athos as pale as a	115.60700225830078
2096/3605	But methinks I need wine and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary	206.61817932128906
2097/3605	Then he let his head sink upon his two hands while DArtagnan stood before him stupef	47.909297943115234
2098/3605	That has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said Athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the	307.3831787109375
2099/3605	God grant you as much Let us	336.0602111816406
2100/3605	Some ham my boy or we cant	1118.6319580078125
2101/3605	Oh I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night	329.17071533203125
2102/3605	Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was   He was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair	252.79151916503906
2103/3605	A worthy man who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married and securing her a	208.2638397216797
2104/3605	He has been hanged and quartered I	520.0479125976562
2105/3605	My God my God cried DArtagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible	115.15782928466797
2106/3605	Taste some of this ham DArtagnan it is exquisite said Athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young mans	136.28817749023438
2107/3605	What a pity it is there were only four like this in the	189.30979919433594
2108/3605	I could have drunk fifty bottles	1465.7335205078125
2109/3605	DArtagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewild	48.722503662109375
2110/3605	Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to	174.96853637695312
2111/3605	THE RETURN     DArtagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half	218.98146057128906
2112/3605	Besides which the Musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter	254.83543395996094
2113/3605	I was pretty drunk yesterday DArtagnan said he I can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very trem	307.6930236816406
2114/3605	I wager that I uttered a thousand extravag	938.1123046875
2115/3605	While saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed	215.4580078125
2116/3605	No replied DArtagnan if I recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common	46.393070220947266
2117/3605	I thought I had told you a most lamentable	231.1147918701172
2118/3605	And he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his	32.97032165527344
2119/3605	My faith said DArtagnan it appears that I was more drunk than you since I remember nothing of the	64.45175170898438
2120/3605	Athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you cannot have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or	426.8054504394531
2121/3605	My drunkenness is always sad and when I am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my	958.0994873046875
2122/3605	That is my failinga capital failing I admit but with that exception I am a good drink	1298.402587890625
2123/3605	Athos spoke this in so natural a manner that DArtagnan was shaken in his	208.2879638671875
2124/3605	It is that then replied the young man anxious to find out the truth it is that then I remember as we remember a	83.79388427734375
2125/3605	Ah you see how it is said Athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh I was sure it was sothe hanging of people is my	281.7673645019531
2126/3605	I remember now yes it was aboutstop a minuteyes it was about a	777.98388671875
2127/3605	Thats it replied Athos becoming almost livid that is my grand story of the fair lady and when I relate that I must be very	171.61541748046875
2128/3605	Yes that was it said DArtagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue	91.75203704833984
2129/3605	By her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued DArtagnan looking intently at Ath	44.36627960205078
2130/3605	Well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied Athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of	53.314300537109375
2131/3605	I certainly never will get drunk again DArtagnan it is too bad a	147.3606719970703
2132/3605	DArtagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once Athos said   By the by I thank you for the horse you have brought	63.6914176940918
2133/3605	Is it to your mind asked DArtagn	19.71997833251953
2134/3605	Yes but it is not a horse for hard	135.6420440673828
2135/3605	You are mistaken I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the Place	108.2104263305664
2136/3605	Ah you begin to awaken my	489.3096618652344
2137/3605	Regret   Yes I have parted with	91.02790069580078
2138/3605	How   Why here is the simple	104.82689666748047
2139/3605	This morning I awoke at six o	122.1257553100586
2140/3605	You were still fast asleep and I did not know what to do with myself I was still stupid from our yesterdays debau	259.2244873046875
2141/3605	As I came into the public room I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from	357.0539245605469
2142/3605	I drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut n	137.51602172851562
2143/3605	_Pardieu_ said I my good gentleman I have a horse to sell	142.09742736816406
2144/3605	Ay and a very fine one I saw him yesterday your friends lackey was leading	270.5468444824219
2145/3605	Do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles Yes Will you sell him to me for that sum No but I will play for	114.44656372070312
2146/3605	No sooner said than done and I lost the	811.9254760742188
2147/3605	Ah ah But please to observe I won back the equipage cried Ath	445.27813720703125
2148/3605	Well I must confess it does replied DArtagn	25.218839645385742
2149/3605	That horse was to have identified us in the day of	594.2771606445312
2150/3605	But my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the Musket	109.5734634399414
2151/3605	I was hipped to death and still further upon my honor I dont like English	377.2530822753906
2152/3605	If it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable	158.48939514160156
2153/3605	As to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its	227.68797302246094
2154/3605	Why the devil A horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy   DArtagnan did not	364.05328369140625
2155/3605	It vexes me greatly continued Athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for I am not yet at the end of my	140.07937622070312
2156/3605	After having lost my own horse nine against tensee how nearI formed an idea of staking	3926.23193359375
2157/3605	Yes but you stopped at the idea I hope   No for I put it in execution that very	82.69414520263672
2158/3605	And the consequence said DArtagnan in great	81.98811340332031
2159/3605	What my horse   Your horse seven against eight a point shortyou know the	504.2701416015625
2160/3605	Athos you are not in your right senses I	219.35047912597656
2161/3605	My dear lad that was yesterday when I was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this	324.0069885253906
2162/3605	I lost him then with all his appointments and	454.7696533203125
2163/3605	Stop a minute you dont know all	244.45904541015625
2164/3605	I should make an excellent gambler if I were not too hotheaded but I was hotheaded just as if I had been	256.7937316894531
2165/3605	Well I was not hotheaded then   Well but what else could you play for You had nothing left   Oh yes my friend there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger and which I had observed	164.70138549804688
2166/3605	This diamond said DArtagnan placing his hand eagerly on his	64.85688018798828
2167/3605	And as I am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once I estimated it at a thousand pist	93.32259368896484
2168/3605	Athos you make me tremble cried DArtagn	45.35371017456055
2169/3605	I mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked	764.0806274414062
2170/3605	What the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it Impossible   Go on go on my dear fellow said DArtagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your	105.33733367919922
2171/3605	We divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles	191.56060791015625
2172/3605	You are laughing at me and want to try me said DArtagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as Minerva takes Achilles in the _Iliad	364.8231201171875
2173/3605	No I do not jest _mordieu_ I should like to have seen you in my place I had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of	137.15936279296875
2174/3605	That was no reason for staking my diamond replied DArtagnan closing his hand with a nervous sp	134.796875
2175/3605	Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge in thirteen throws I had lost allin thirteen	1737.658447265625
2176/3605	The number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of July that   _Ventrebleu_ cried DArtagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding	130.8734588623047
2177/3605	Patience said Athos I had a	92.8764419555664
2178/3605	The Englishman was an original I had seen him conversing that morning with Grimaud and Grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his	78.10717010498047
2179/3605	I staked Grimaud the silent Grimaud divided into ten	3282.17333984375
2180/3605	Well what next said DArtagnan laughing in spite of	28.661706924438477
2181/3605	Grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of Grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon I regained the	849.388671875
2182/3605	Tell me now if persistence is not a virtue   My faith But this is droll cried DArtagnan consoled and holding his sides with	252.35421752929688
2183/3605	You may guess finding the luck turned that I again staked the	1557.3187255859375
2184/3605	The devil said DArtagnan becoming angry	74.05945587158203
2185/3605	I won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then I lost	677.3173217773438
2186/3605	In brief I regained your harness and then	1755.8065185546875
2187/3605	That was a superb throw so I left off	592.455322265625
2188/3605	DArtagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his	116.25892639160156
2189/3605	Then the diamond is safe said he timid	179.8485870361328
2190/3605	Intact my dear friend besides the harness of your Bucephalus and	3015.2138671875
2191/3605	But what is the use of harnesses without horses   I have an idea about	90.9028091430664
2192/3605	You have not played for a long time DArtagn	26.150991439819336
2193/3605	And I have no inclination to	71.9823226928711
2194/3605	You have not played for a long time I said you ought then to have a good	82.34048461914062
2195/3605	Well what then   Well the Englishman and his companion are still	60.02890396118164
2196/3605	I remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very	1116.66845703125
2197/3605	You appear to think much of your	318.2140808105469
2198/3605	In your place I would stake the furniture against the	726.2258911132812
2199/3605	But he will not wish for only one	250.52474975585938
2200/3605	Stake both _pardieu_ I am not selfish as you	68.46098327636719
2201/3605	You would do so said DArtagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of Athos begin to prevail in spite of	207.8821563720703
2202/3605	On my honor in one single	980.052490234375
2203/3605	But having lost the horses I am particularly anxious to preserve the harness	264.560302734375
2204/3605	Never never   The devil said Ath	29.14942169189453
2205/3605	I would propose to you to stake Planchet but as that has already been done the Englishman would not perhaps be	110.08307647705078
2206/3605	Decidedly my dear Athos said DArtagnan I should like better not to risk	72.97360229492188
2207/3605	Good Lord try one throw One throw is soon made   And if I lose   You will	509.49468994140625
2208/3605	But if I lose   Well you will surrender the harness	215.95623779296875
2209/3605	Have with you for one throw said DArtagn	37.45895004272461
2210/3605	Athos went in quest of the Englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy	436.60321044921875
2211/3605	He proposed the conditionsthe two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pist	349.2635803222656
2212/3605	The Englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred pist	401.5611572265625
2213/3605	DArtagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified Athos who however consented himself with saying Thats a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsie	227.64195251464844
2214/3605	The Englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the	526.0767822265625
2215/3605	He threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory DArtagnan turned aside to conceal his ill	113.20819091796875
2216/3605	Hold hold hold said Athos wit his quiet tone that throw of the dice is	869.5814819335938
2217/3605	I have not seen such a one four times in my	56.78722381591797
2218/3605	Two aces   The Englishman looked and was seized with aston	70.36888885498047
2219/3605	DArtagnan looked and was seized with	56.84246826171875
2220/3605	Then Monsieur takes his horse back again said the English	62.43971252441406
2221/3605	Then there is no revenge   Our conditions said No revenge you will please to recol	176.11585998535156
2222/3605	That is true the horse shall be restored to your lackey monsie	68.65743255615234
2223/3605	A moment said Athos with your permission monsieur I wish to speak a word with my	34.4494514465332
2224/3605	Well Tempter what more do you want with me said DArtagn	73.44290924072266
2225/3605	You want me to throw again do you not   No I would wish you to	50.9503288269043
2226/3605	On what   You mean to take your horse   Without	52.434669494628906
2227/3605	You know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your	276.5269470214844
2228/3605	Well then I repeat you are	99.9929428100586
2229/3605	What is the use of one horse for us two I could not ride	162.61102294921875
2230/3605	We should look like the two sons of Aymon who had lost their	844.878173828125
2231/3605	You cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent	1625.05224609375
2232/3605	For my part I should not hesitate a moment I should take the hundred pist	54.32171630859375
2233/3605	We want money for our return to	120.1003646850586
2234/3605	I am much attached to that horse Ath	88.79437255859375

2242/3605	Nothing nothing Go on   Your advice then   To take the hundred pistoles DArtagn	63.33354187011719
2243/3605	With the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the	52.70626449584961

2246/3605	Take the hundred pistoles my friend take the hundred pistoles   DArtagnan only required one reason to be	44.53856658935547
2247/3605	Besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of Ath	372.12823486328125
2248/3605	He acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the Englishman paid down on the	310.57110595703125

2251/3605	However ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at Crèvecœ	1521.3226318359375
2252/3605	From a distance they perceived Aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like Sister Anne at the dust in the	304.16107177734375
2253/3605	_Holà_ Aramis What the devil are you doing there cried the two	273.5279846191406
2254/3605	Ah is that you DArtagnan and you Athos said the young	20.10550308227539
2255/3605	I was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave	137.23532104492188
2256/3605	My English horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the	464.2885437011719
2257/3605	Life itself may be resolved into three words _Erat est fuit	16126.7451171875
2258/3605	Which means said DArtagnan who began to suspect the	29.586944580078125
2259/3605	Which means that I have just been dupedsixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an	230.9930419921875
2260/3605	My dear DArtagnan said Aramis dont be too angry with me I	34.278846740722656

2262/3605	Ah you fellows are good managers You ride on our lackeys horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short	1854.1829833984375
2263/3605	At the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the Amiens road pulled up at the inn and Planchet and Grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their	182.10781860351562
2264/3605	The cart was returning empty to Paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to slake the wagoners thirst along the	831.528564453125
2265/3605	What is this said Aramis on seeing them	136.14093017578125
2266/3605	Nothing but saddles   Now do you understand said Ath	46.15612030029297
2267/3605	My friends thats exactly like me I retained my harness by	1632.9224853515625
2268/3605	_Holà_ Bazin Bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these	1033.483154296875
2269/3605	And what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked DArtagn	169.01553344726562
2270/3605	My dear fellow I invited them to a dinner the next day replied Aram	116.3584213256836
2271/3605	They have some capital wine hereplease to observe that in	1468.84765625
2272/3605	I did my best to make them	278.11260986328125
2273/3605	Then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the Jesuit entreated me to get him made a Musket	258.2160949707031
2274/3605	Without a thesis cried DArtagnan without a thesis I demand the suppression of the	1015.4979248046875
2275/3605	Since then continued Aramis I have lived very agree	359.9258728027344
2276/3605	I have begun a poem in verses of one syll	673.5523071289062

2279/3605	It has four hundred lines and lasts a	1024.3609619140625
2280/3605	My faith my dear Aramis said DArtagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did Latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two	210.3727264404297
2281/3605	You will see continued Aramis that it breathes irreproachable	1931.8458251953125
2282/3605	And so my friends we return to Paris Bravo I am	299.4864501953125
2283/3605	We are going to rejoin that good fellow Porth	47.5526008605957
2284/3605	You cant think how I have missed him the great simple	295.234619140625
2285/3605	To see him so selfsatisfied reconciles me with	3747.423095703125
2286/3605	He would not sell his horse not for a kingdom I think I can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome	243.47996520996094
2287/3605	I am sure he will look like the Great Mogul   They made a halt for an hour to refresh their	281.19451904296875
2288/3605	Aramis discharged his bill placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join Porth	215.48008728027344
2289/3605	They found him up less pale than when DArtagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four	114.30732727050781
2290/3605	This dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb	69979.9375
2291/3605	Ah _pardieu_ said he rising you come in the nick of time	79.66072082519531

2294/3605	Besides here is a piquant _fricandeau_ and a fillet of	2753.173095703125
2295/3605	I am recruiting myself said Porthos I am recruiting	789.2991943359375
2296/3605	Nothing weakens a man more than these devilish	3441.76171875
2297/3605	Did you ever suffer from a strain Athos   Never Though I remember in our affair of the Rue Férou I received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same	189.28065490722656
2298/3605	But this dinner was not intended for you alone Porthos said Aram	48.32666015625

2302/3605	_Pardieu_ replied DArtagnan for my part I am eating veal garnished with shrimps and	399.5126037597656
2303/3605	And I some lamb chops said Porth	1343.4871826171875
2304/3605	And I a plain chicken said Aram	877.6897583007812
2305/3605	You are all mistaken gentlemen answered Athos gravely you are eating	340.413818359375
2306/3605	Horse said Aramis with a grimace of	108.53780364990234
2307/3605	Are we not eating a horse Porthos And perhaps his saddle there	447.1119689941406
2308/3605	No gentlemen I have kept the harness said Porth	72.0466079711914
2309/3605	My faith said Aramis we are all	283.2807922363281
2310/3605	One would think we had tipped the	14779.904296875
2311/3605	This horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and I dont like to humiliate	648.7420654296875
2312/3605	Then your duchess is still at the waters asked DArtagn	63.22591018676758
2313/3605	And my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen I expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that I gave him to	129.46591186523438
2314/3605	My God yes _gave_ that is the word said Porthos for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis and the stingy fellow would only give me	138.5443572998047
2315/3605	You will observe gentlemen said Athos that Porthos has made the best bargain of any of	146.58558654785156
2316/3605	And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor Porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his	139.46734619140625
2317/3605	There is one comfort we are all in cash said DArtagn	91.77996063232422
2318/3605	Well for my part said Athos I found Aramiss Spanish wine so good that I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lac	207.22193908691406
2319/3605	And I said Aramis imagined that I had given almost my last sou to the church of Montdidier and the Jesuits of Amiens with whom I had made engagements which I ought to have	164.5108184814453
2320/3605	I have ordered Masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which I have not the least doubt you will be marvelously	506.4360046386719
2321/3605	Ay ay said Athos exchanging a smile with DArtagnan and Aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good	107.689208984375
2322/3605	In short said Porthos when all my expenses are paid I shall have at most thirty crowns	244.89236450195312
2323/3605	And I about ten pistoles said Aram	129.02847290039062
2324/3605	Well then it appears that we are the Crœsuses of the	964.4437866210938
2325/3605	How much have you left of your hundred pistoles DArtagnan   Of my hundred pistoles Why in the first place I gave you	64.12432861328125
2326/3605	You think so   _Pardieu_   Ah that is	12.250699996948242
2327/3605	What a brute of a host Why did you give him six pistoles   You told me to give them to	77.26399230957031
2328/3605	It is true I am too goodnat	91.7158203125
2329/3605	In brief how much remains   Twentyfive pistoles said DArtagn	79.57571411132812
2330/3605	And I said Athos taking some small change from his pocket I   You Nothing   My faith So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general	172.93759155273438
2331/3605	Now then let us calculate how much we posses in	469.8134460449219
2332/3605	Four hundred and seventyfive livres said DArtagnan who reckoned like Archim	357.34259033203125
2333/3605	On our arrival in Paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said Porth	194.65797424316406
2334/3605	Well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw	132.5867919921875
2335/3605	There   Let us dine then said Porthos it is getting	44.503238677978516
2336/3605	The friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton Bazin Planchet and Grim	84.77507019042969
2337/3605	On arriving in Paris DArtagnan found a letter from	53.06460952758789
2338/3605	de Tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the Musket	96.01168060302734
2339/3605	As this was the height of DArtagnans worldly ambitionapart be it well understood from his desire of finding M	477.35345458984375

2341/3605	They were assembled in council at the residence of Athos which always indicated an event of some	207.16107177734375

2343/3605	The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilder	610.2271118164062
2344/3605	de Tréville never jested in matters relating to	1999.950439453125
2345/3605	And what do you reckon your outfit will cost said DArtagn	125.18402862548828
2346/3605	We have made our calculations with Spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred liv	3915.4931640625
2347/3605	Four times fifteen makes sixtysix thousand livres said Ath	223.1235809326172
2348/3605	It seems to me said DArtagnan with a thousand livres eachI do not speak as a Spartan but as a procurator   This word _procurator_ roused Porth	121.91822052001953
2349/3605	Stop said he I have an	28.510759353637695
2350/3605	Well thats something for I have not the shadow of one said Athos coolly but as to DArtagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to _ours_ has driven him out of his	109.37275695800781
2351/3605	A thousand livres For my part I declare I want two	260.0538635253906
2352/3605	Four times two makes eight then said Aramis it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the sadd	405.3870544433594
2353/3605	Besides said Athos waiting till DArtagnan who went to thank Monsieur de Tréville had shut the door besides there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our	72.49252319335938
2354/3605	What the devil DArtagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his	132.08457946777344
2355/3605	To this preoccupation of his vanity DArtagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less	110.22242736816406
2356/3605	Bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of	143.3923797607422
2357/3605	de Tréville had spoken of her to the	50.183372497558594
2358/3605	The queen was ignorant where the mercers young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure DArtagn	299.3273010253906
2359/3605	Athos did not leave his chamber he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip	131.4232177734375
2360/3605	It will then be said of me that I died for the king so that I shall have performed my duty without the expense of an	201.93344116210938
2361/3605	Porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating I shall follow up on my	163.52427673339844
2362/3605	Aramis anxious and negligently dressed said	1555.7459716796875
2363/3605	It may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the	1111.11865234375
2364/3605	The lackeys on their part like the coursers of Hippolytus shared the sadness of their	2864.867919921875
2365/3605	The three friendsfor as we have said Athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himselfwent out early in the morning and returned late at	408.8861999511719
2366/3605	They wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind	177.07177734375
2367/3605	They might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they	1002.3464965820312
2368/3605	When they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say Have you found anything   However as Porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to	144.5496063232422
2369/3605	He was a man of execution this worthy Porth	49.19483947753906
2370/3605	DArtagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of	83.0219955444336
2371/3605	He entered after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant	1849.260498046875
2372/3605	As DArtagnan took some precautions to conceal himself Porthos believed he had not been	43.07609939575195
2373/3605	Porthos went and leaned against the side of a	104.01634216308594
2374/3605	DArtagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other	44.97932052612305
2375/3605	There happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of	273.7264404296875
2376/3605	Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the	672.0787353515625
2377/3605	Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the	189.8212432861328
2378/3605	DArtagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which Porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black	429.63330078125
2379/3605	The eyes of Porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the n	591.716796875
2380/3605	On her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos and then immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anx	77.52945709228516
2381/3605	It was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her	407.11480712890625
2382/3605	The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of Porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little Negro and the maidserv	923.9334106445312
2383/3605	It was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained	1488.6641845703125
2384/3605	Then she cried Ahem under cover of the _mea culpa_ striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward	1299.546630859375
2385/3605	Nevertheless he understood it all but was	523.1679077148438
2386/3605	DArtagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos which amused him	108.59640502929688
2387/3605	He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurators wife of the Rue aux Ours which was the more probable from the church of	959.6846923828125
2388/3605	Leu being not far from that	2644.121337890625
2389/3605	He guessed likewise by induction that Porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of Chantilly when the procurators wife had proved so refractory with respect to her	1105.5145263671875
2390/3605	Amid all this DArtagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of Porth	100.50989532470703
2391/3605	There were only chimeras and illusions but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras   The sermon over the procurators wife advanced toward the holy	3493.042236328125
2392/3605	Porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand	232.2400665283203
2393/3605	The procurators wife smiled thinking that it was for her Porthos had put himself to this trouble but she was cruelly and promptly unde	488.2452392578125
2394/3605	When she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her	168.2686309814453
2395/3605	When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos Porthos drew his dripping hand from the	355.08587646484375
2396/3605	The fair worshipper touched the great hand of Porthos with her delicate fingers smiled made the sign of the cross and left the	340.4032897949219
2397/3605	This was too much for the procurators wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and Porth	282.36334228515625
2398/3605	Ah said he you have remarked   I must have been blind not to have	53.841453552246094
2399/3605	Monsieur Porthos said the procurators wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes I have something to say to	73.9755630493164
2400/3605	Certainly madame said Porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pl	166.99282836914062
2401/3605	At that moment DArtagnan passed in pursuit of Milady he cast a passing glance at Porthos and beheld this triumphant	108.29591369628906
2402/3605	Magloirea littlefrequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each	7959.5908203125
2403/3605	In the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at	1091.5965576171875
2404/3605	And that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat   Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman M	163.58168029785156
2405/3605	Porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a	185.63539123535156
2406/3605	Ah you are quite the pet of the ladies Monsieur Porthos resumed the procurators wife with a	140.2406463623047
2407/3605	Well responded Porthos you may imagine with the physique with which nature has endowed me I am not in want of good	193.2928466796875
2408/3605	Good Lord how quickly men forget cried the procurators wife raising her eyes toward	3119.67041015625
2409/3605	Less quickly than the women it seems to me replied Porthos for I madame I may say I was your victim when wounded dying I was abandoned by the	162.9461212158203
2410/3605	But Monsieur Porthos murmured the procurators wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was	116.37418365478516
2411/3605	I who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de   I know it	144.9225616455078
2412/3605	The Comtesse de   Monsieur Porthos be generous   You are right madame and I will not	41.64152145385742
2413/3605	But it was my husband who would not hear of	483.0407409667969
2414/3605	Madame Coquenard said Porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which I preserve engraved in my	366.20001220703125
2415/3605	Besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather	340.1965637207031
2416/3605	Madame Coquenard I gave you the	1672.1802978515625
2417/3605	I had but to write to the Duchessebut I wont repeat her name for I am incapable of compromising a woman but this I know that I had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen	156.65525817871094
2418/3605	Monsieur Porthos said she I can assure you that you have severely punished me and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to	56.6374626159668
2419/3605	Fie madame fie said Porthos as if	618.6630249023438
2420/3605	Let us not talk about money if you please it is	144.59910583496094
2421/3605	Then you no longer love me said the procurators wife slowly and	805.6458129882812
2422/3605	And that is the only reply you make Alas I	259.24139404296875
2423/3605	Think of the offense you have committed toward me madame It remains _here_ said Porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it	255.33753967285156
2424/3605	I will repair it indeed I will my dear Porth	119.1561279296875
2425/3605	Besides what did I ask of you resumed Porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good	151.1064910888672
2426/3605	A loan nothing more After all I am not an unreasonable	1815.7335205078125
2427/3605	I know you are not rich Madame Coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from	395.966796875
2428/3605	Oh If you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardon	111.15435791015625
2429/3605	Please to know Monsieur Porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurators wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected min	406.4547424316406
2430/3605	That doubles the offense said Porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurators wife for if you are rich Madame Coquenard then there is no excuse for your	775.7243041992188
2431/3605	When I said rich replied the procurators wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word	529.300537109375
2432/3605	I am not precisely rich though I am pretty well	282.9886474609375
2433/3605	Hold madame said Porthos let us say no more upon the subject I beg of	22.35511016845703
2434/3605	You have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between	1605.5899658203125
2435/3605	Ingrate that you are   Ah I advise you to complain said Porth	64.77025604248047
2436/3605	Begone then to your beautiful duchess I will detain you no	101.9532241821289
2437/3605	And she is not to be despised in my	35.69647979736328
2438/3605	Something whispers me so continued Porthos becoming more and more	198.0098419189453
2439/3605	Rather say that you have a new	116.77997589111328
2440/3605	Not so I speak frankly to	124.74059295654297
2441/3605	No object affects me and I even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for	220.712646484375
2442/3605	But in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to	134.25694274902344
2443/3605	I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my	499.8720397949219
2444/3605	Then I must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of Brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my	207.1366729736328
2445/3605	Porthos observed a last struggle between love and avar	245.56004333496094
2446/3605	And as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey	210.6363067626953
2447/3605	Journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in	2360.986328125
2448/3605	Have you no friends in Paris then Monsieur Porthos said the procurators	131.33087158203125
2449/3605	I thought I had said Porthos resuming his melancholy air but I have been taught my	81.24455261230469
2450/3605	You have some cried the procurators wife in a transport that surprised even	1198.067626953125
2451/3605	You are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from Noyon in Picardy you have several lawsuits and no	761.8199462890625
2452/3605	Can you recollect all that   Perfectly mad	46.879554748535156
2453/3605	And be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventysix	887.5988159179688
2454/3605	Seventysix years _Peste_ Thats a fine age replied Porth	157.9759521484375
2455/3605	A great age you mean Monsieur Porth	37.193397521972656
2456/3605	Yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at Porth	148.728271484375
2457/3605	Fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes	1859.5423583984375
2458/3605	You are a woman of precaution I see my dear Madame Coquenard said Porthos squeezing the hand of the procurators wife tender	612.857666015625
2459/3605	We are then reconciled dear Monsieur Porthos said she sim	462.95086669921875
2460/3605	For life replied Porthos in the same	30.95582389831543
2461/3605	DARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN     DArtagnan followed Milady without being perceived by	15241.5517578125
2462/3605	He saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to	213.87501525878906
2463/3605	It was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful	299.8484191894531
2464/3605	DArtagnan therefore returned to the Rue Fé	31.75653839111328
2465/3605	In the Rue de Seine he met Planchet who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing	453.2410583496094
2466/3605	He ordered him to go and saddle two horses in	272.0804443359375
2467/3605	de Trévilles stablesone for himself DArtagnan and one for Planchetand bring them to Athoss	134.42843627929688
2468/3605	Once for all Tréville had placed his stable at DArtagnans	167.2144317626953
2469/3605	Planchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier and DArtagnan toward the Rue Fé	87.71257781982422
2470/3605	Athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous Spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into Picard	431.0037841796875
2471/3605	He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for DArtagnan and Grimaud obeyed as	30.351924896240234
2472/3605	DArtagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between Porthos and the procurators wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be	152.5597686767578
2473/3605	As for me replied Athos to this recital I am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my	139.37844848632812
2474/3605	Handsome wellbred noble lord as you are my dear Athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicit	1043.2205810546875
2475/3605	How young this DArtagnan is said Athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to Grimaud to bring another	32.557743072509766
2476/3605	At that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the halfopen door and told his master that the horses were	156.2991180419922
2477/3605	Two horses that Monsieur de Tréville lends me at my pleasure and with which I am now going to take a ride to	78.6838150024414
2478/3605	Well and what are you going to do at	50.46158981323242
2479/3605	Then DArtagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind	182.84226989746094
2480/3605	That is to say you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame Bonacieux said Athos shrugging his shoulders contemptuously as if he pitied human	87.65015411376953
2481/3605	I am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is	226.67283630371094
2482/3605	I do not know why but I imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as I am has an influence over my	96.52879333496094
2483/3605	Well perhaps you are right said Ath	29.411914825439453
2484/3605	I do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once	105.41416931152344
2485/3605	Madame Bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is	115.1984634399414
2486/3605	What is to be said I must divert my attention   Amuse yourself with Milady my dear DArtagnan I wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse	114.91553497314453
2487/3605	Instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to	296.8056640625
2488/3605	My dear fellow said Athos I ride horses when I have any when I have none I go a	123.45455932617188
2489/3605	Well said DArtagnan smiling at the misanthropy of Athos which from any other person would have offended him I ride what I can get I am not so proud as	74.82625579833984
2490/3605	_Au revoir_ said the Musketeer making a sign to Grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just	301.4425964355469
2491/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet mounted and took the road to	19.50290870666504
2492/3605	All along the road what Athos had said respecting M	1162.29443359375
2493/3605	Bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young	30.284555435180664
2494/3605	Although DArtagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercers pretty wife had made a real impression upon his	293.248046875
2495/3605	As he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to	91.37114715576172
2496/3605	Meantime he was going to try to find out Mil	106.53095245361328
2497/3605	Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew	181.51507568359375
2498/3605	Now in the opinion of DArtagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off M	99.13327026367188
2499/3605	Bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the	44.01157760620117
2500/3605	DArtagnan then only halflied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of Milady he at the same time went in search of Const	242.8677215576172
2501/3605	Thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse DArtagnan completed his short journey and arrived at	149.8822479248047
2502/3605	He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later Louis	157.6707000732422
2503/3605	This person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with	180.3741912841797
2504/3605	Eh monsieur said he addressing DArtagnan dont you remember that face which is blinking yonder   No said DArtagnan and yet I am certain it is not the first time I have seen that vis	32.19757080078125
2505/3605	_Parbleu_ I believe it is not said Planc	60.443660736083984
2506/3605	Why it is poor Lubin the lackey of the Comte de Wardeshe whom you took such good care of a month ago at Calais on the road to the governors country house   So it is said DArtagnan I know him	213.75296020507812
2507/3605	Do you think he would recollect you   My faith monsieur he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of	95.40370178222656
2508/3605	Well go and talk with the boy said DArtagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is	97.40308380126953
2509/3605	At the end of an instants observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw Miladys carriage stop opposite to	311.88165283203125
2510/3605	He could not be mistaken Milady was in	120.7579345703125
2511/3605	DArtagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being	26.697004318237305
2512/3605	Milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her	315.4522705078125
2513/3605	The maid approached Planchet whom she took for Lubin and holding out a little billet to him said For your	415.2232360839844
2514/3605	Thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove	237.0463104248047
2515/3605	Then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met DArtagnan who having seen all was coming to	126.01176452636719
2516/3605	For you monsieur said Planchet presenting the billet to the young	36.16769790649414
2517/3605	For me said DArtagnan are you sure of that   _Pardieu_ monsieur I cant be more	20.15337371826172
2518/3605	Oh said DArtagnan this is rather warm it appears that Milady and I are anxious about the health of the same	73.60958099365234
2519/3605	As I said monsieur Lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the	213.96231079101562
2520/3605	Well done Planchet you are the king of lac	81.87638092041016
2521/3605	Now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the	607.3975219726562
2522/3605	At the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside a cavalier richly dressed was close to the	97.21525573730469
2523/3605	The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that DArtagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his	116.2960205078125
2524/3605	The conversation took place in Englisha language which DArtagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful Englishwoman was in a great	161.96177673339844
2525/3605	She terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand	351.3991394042969
2526/3605	The cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate Milady still	380.52728271484375
2527/3605	DArtagnan thought this was the moment to	36.650272369384766
2528/3605	He approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said Madame will you permit me to offer you my services It appears to me that this cavalier has made you very	94.60269165039062
2529/3605	Speak one word madame and I take upon myself to punish him for his want of	154.08438110351562
2530/3605	At the first word Milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good French Monsieur I should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my	136.4490509033203
2531/3605	You must be aware that I was ignorant of that mad	36.76994705200195
2532/3605	What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about cried the cavalier whom Milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach	501.57989501953125
2533/3605	Why does not he go about his business   Stupid fellow yourself said DArtagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage	145.05682373046875
2534/3605	I do not go on because it pleases me to stop	89.02313995361328
2535/3605	The cavalier addressed some words in English to his	277.6913146972656
2536/3605	I speak to you in French said DArtagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same	57.44746398925781
2537/3605	You are Madames brother I learnbe it so but fortunately you are not	2084.578857421875
2538/3605	The carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated	477.8777160644531
2539/3605	Well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than I am for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us	48.97365951538086
2540/3605	Ah said the Englishman is it you my master It seems you must always be playing some game or	143.694091796875
2541/3605	Yes and that reminds me that I have a revenge to	70.36885833740234
2542/3605	We will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice	180.22286987304688
2543/3605	You see plainly that I have no sword said the English	90.23876190185547
2544/3605	Do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man   I hope you have a sword at home but at all events I have two and if you like I will throw with you for one of	100.83753204345703
2545/3605	Needless said the Englishman I am well furnished with such play	815.5499267578125
2546/3605	Very well my worthy gentleman replied DArtagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this	231.99102783203125
2547/3605	Where if you please   Behind the Luxembourg thats a charming spot for such amusements as the one I propose to	148.02536010742188
2548/3605	That will do I will be	111.21459197998047
2549/3605	_A propos_ you have probably one or two friends   I have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with	304.3685607910156
2550/3605	Three Marvelous That falls out oddly Three is just my number   Now then who are you asked the English	1023.2717895507812
2551/3605	I am Monsieur dArtagnan a Gascon gentleman serving in the kings Musket	41.77582931518555
2552/3605	And you   I am Lord de Winter Baron	833.7590942382812
2553/3605	Well then I am your servant Monsieur Baron said DArtagnan though you have names rather difficult to recol	94.84709930419922
2554/3605	And touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to	467.27740478515625
2555/3605	As he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence DArtagnan went straight to the residence of Ath	41.357521057128906
2556/3605	He found Athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find	127.07138061523438
2557/3605	He related to Athos all that had passed except the letter to	89.68692016601562
2558/3605	Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an English	84.86457061767578
2559/3605	We might say that was his	203.2708740234375
2560/3605	They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the	64.89137268066406
2561/3605	Porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a	188.59495544433594
2562/3605	Aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in Athoss closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing	335.36834716796875
2563/3605	Athos by signs desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of	628.9212036132812
2564/3605	DArtagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they	193.4694366455078
2565/3605	ENGLISH AND FRENCH     The hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the Luxembourg given up to the feeding of	2089.3017578125
2566/3605	Athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to	420.29425048828125
2567/3605	The lackeys were ordered to act as sentin	145.37818908691406
2568/3605	A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the Musket	439.690673828125
2569/3605	Then according to foreign custom the presentations took	3561.30126953125
2570/3605	The Englishmen were all men of rank consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise but of	607.7217407226562
2571/3605	But after all said Lord de Winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you	69.30204010009766
2572/3605	We cannot fight with such names they are names of shepher	262.76611328125
2573/3605	Therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said Ath	266.55975341796875
2574/3605	Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the English	127.72034454345703
2575/3605	You played very willingly with us without knowing our names said Athos by the same token that you won our	300.89385986328125
2576/3605	That is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our	420.99127197265625
2577/3605	One plays with anybody but one fights only with	3518.478271484375
2578/3605	And that is but just said Athos and he took aside the one of the four Englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low	74.30193328857422
2579/3605	Does that satisfy you said Athos to his	76.21800231933594
2580/3605	Do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me   Yes monsieur said the Englishman b	54.39904022216797
2581/3605	Well now shall I tell you something added Athos co	166.4173126220703
2582/3605	Why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself	127.02672576904297
2583/3605	Why so   Because I am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know I am living so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the	166.45358276367188
2584/3605	The Englishman looked at Athos believing that he jested but Athos did not jest the least in the	85.95001220703125
2585/3605	Gentlemen said Athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready   Yes answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen as with one	141.7777099609375
2586/3605	Immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice	1068.0867919921875
2587/3605	Athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing	888.979248046875
2588/3605	Porthos abated no doubt of his toogreat confidence by his adventure of Chantilly played with skill and prud	887.9061889648438
2589/3605	Aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in	422.96697998046875
2590/3605	He hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one the sword pierced his	330.99365234375
2591/3605	Second Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh As the Englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his	128.1168212890625
2592/3605	Aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lac	614.40234375
2593/3605	As to DArtagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword	247.7845001220703
2594/3605	The baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell	371.4537048339844
2595/3605	DArtagnan was over him at a bound and said to the Englishman pointing his sword to his throat I could kill you my Lord you are completely in my hands but I spare your life for the sake of your	76.84989166259766
2596/3605	DArtagnan was at the height of joy he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his	354.709228515625
2597/3605	As Porthos and Aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his	145.45462036132812
2598/3605	DArtagnan picked it up and offered it to Lord de	34.759605407714844
2599/3605	What the devil would you have me do with that said the English	39.7364501953125
2600/3605	You can restore it to his family said DArtagn	34.10786819458008
2601/3605	His family will care much about such a trifle as that His family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from	401.7762756347656
2602/3605	DArtagnan put the purse into his	31.765148162841797
2603/3605	DArtagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of ass	42.77392578125
2604/3605	At this time Athos came up to DArtagn	16.12505531311035
2605/3605	What do you mean to do with that purse whispered	125.67961120605469
2606/3605	Why I meant to pass it over to you my dear Ath	84.51227569580078
2607/3605	Me why to me   Why you killed him They are the spoils of	266.20574951171875
2608/3605	Porthos shrugged his shoulders Aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed Ath	201.60084533691406
2609/3605	Then said DArtagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as Lord de Winter desired us to	38.527488708496094
2610/3605	Yes said Athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the English	63.1595573425293
2611/3605	Athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coach	70.44157409667969
2612/3605	This greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even Porthos and this French generosity repeated by Lord de Winter and his friend was highly applauded except by	529.736083984375
2613/3605	Lord de Winter on quitting DArtagnan gave him his sisters	112.18209075927734
2614/3605	She lived in the Place Royalethen the fashionable quarterat Number 6 and he undertook to call and take DArtagnan with him in order to introduce	448.86187744140625
2615/3605	DArtagnan appointed eight oclock at Athoss	121.37915802001953
2616/3605	This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon	2244.1767578125
2617/3605	He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his	144.904052734375
2618/3605	According to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot	391.2646484375
2619/3605	His only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of	560.0925903320312
2620/3605	Then she knew that he was one of the friends of	30.458450317382812
2621/3605	de Tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to Milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with	209.8841552734375
2622/3605	As to the commencement of an intrigue between her and	239.37928771972656
2623/3605	de Wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinals	1015.1473999023438
2624/3605	It is not for nothing we are but twenty years old above all if we were born at Tar	232.7964324951172
2625/3605	DArtagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to Athoss and according to custom related everything to	144.94703674316406
2626/3605	Athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of	341.958251953125
2627/3605	What said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after	241.4112091064453
2628/3605	DArtagnan felt the truth of this rep	33.82349395751953
2629/3605	I loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart while I only love Milady with my head said	207.2188720703125
2630/3605	In getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at	705.9874877929688
2631/3605	The part she plays _pardieu_ It is not difficult to divine that after all you have told	88.67565155029297
2632/3605	She is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your	98.4342041015625
2633/3605	The devil my dear Athos you view things on the dark side meth	543.6123657226562
2634/3605	Can it be otherwise I bought my experience dearlyparticularly fair	7432.4404296875
2635/3605	Milady is fair you say   She has the most beautiful light hair imaginable   Ah my poor DArtagnan said Ath	68.93804168701172
2636/3605	Listen to me I want to be enlightened on a subject then when I shall have learned what I desire to know I will	75.88079071044922
2637/3605	Lord de Winter arrived at the appointed time but Athos being warned of his coming went into the other	167.57545471191406
2638/3605	He therefore found DArtagnan alone and as it was nearly eight oclock he took the young man with	28.97482681274414
2639/3605	An elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the Place	144.03323364257812
2640/3605	Thank him then madame if you have any affection for	40.3945426940918
2641/3605	Milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at	292.21343994140625
2642/3605	The brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with Miladys favorite monkey which had pulled him by the double	263.6799621582031
2643/3605	You are welcome monsieur said Milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of illhumor which DArtagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my	189.8018798828125
2644/3605	The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single	1386.6517333984375
2645/3605	Milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to	234.52584838867188
2646/3605	The blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her	446.1116638183594
2647/3605	Lord de Winter perceived nothing of	589.6434936523438
2648/3605	When he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and	160.18910217285156
2649/3605	He filled two glasses and by a sign invited DArtagnan to	147.62991333007812
2650/3605	DArtagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to refuse to pledge	374.39434814453125
2651/3605	He therefore drew near to the table and took the second	67.63607025146484
2652/3605	He did not however lose sight of Milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her	83.408203125
2653/3605	Now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her count	381.24993896484375
2654/3605	She bit her handkerchief with her beautiful	142.89553833007812
2655/3605	That pretty little _soubrette_ whom DArtagnan had already observed then came	229.91470336914062
2656/3605	She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English who thereupon requested DArtagnans permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his	241.51055908203125
2657/3605	DArtagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter and then returned to Mil	69.67683410644531
2658/3605	Her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood	930.9530639648438
2659/3605	Those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of	459.3089599609375
2660/3605	She told DArtagnan that Lord de Winter was her brotherinlaw and not her	49.67867660522461
2661/3605	She had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one	221.224609375
2662/3605	This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter if Lord de Winter did not	89.60955047607422
2663/3605	All this showed DArtagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this	133.91111755371094
2664/3605	In addition to this after a half hours conversation DArtagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that	374.4373779296875
2665/3605	DArtagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of	465.3680114746094
2666/3605	To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon Milady replied with a smile of	166.9320068359375
2667/3605	The hour came for him to	322.5490417480469
2668/3605	DArtagnan took leave of Milady and left the saloon the happiest of	111.40556335449219
2669/3605	On the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_ who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted	355.7629699707031
2670/3605	DArtagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening	56.008216857910156
2671/3605	Lord de Winter was not at home and it was Milady who this time did all the honors of the	105.3292007446289
2672/3605	She appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the	196.2109832763672
2673/3605	DArtagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding Mil	225.88873291015625
2674/3605	He launched into a eulogy of his Eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the kings Guards if he had happened to know	279.9225158691406
2675/3605	Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked DArtagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in	100.53572845458984
2676/3605	DArtagnan replied that he had been sent thither by	48.0472297668457
2677/3605	de Tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as	196.81031799316406
2678/3605	Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips she had to deal with a Gascon who played	139.76913452148438
2679/3605	At the same hour as on the preceding evening DArtagnan	53.048709869384766
2680/3605	In the corridor he again met the pretty Kitty that was the name of the _soubrette	432.9474182128906
2681/3605	She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but DArtagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but	63.314701080322266
2682/3605	DArtagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day Milady gave him a more gracious	132.4099578857422
2683/3605	Every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty _soubrette	204.09779357910156
2684/3605	But as we have said DArtagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor	184.74403381347656
2685/3605	A PROCURATORS DINNER     However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurators	1832.7208251953125
2686/3605	On the morrow he received the last touches of Mousquetons brush for an hour and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with	349.03564453125
2687/3605	His heart beat but not like DArtagnans with a young and impatient	164.3167724609375
2688/3605	No a more material interest stirred his	2130.021728515625
2689/3605	He was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of	404.78765869140625
2690/3605	And yet at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some	269.79461669921875
2691/3605	A shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the	1801.314697265625
2692/3605	In all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive client	1085.500732421875
2693/3605	Although the Musketeer was not expected before one oclock the procurators wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his	364.5167541503906
2694/3605	Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward	205.0712890625
2695/3605	The clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tonguet	2508.89013671875
2696/3605	It is my cousin cried the procurators	2351.80517578125
2697/3605	Come in come in Monsieur Porthos   The name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but Porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its	132.15475463867188
2698/3605	They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have	101.6370849609375
2699/3605	This last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with	2249.2021484375
2700/3605	On quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception	192.08343505859375
2701/3605	All these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire Porthos	318.452392578125
2702/3605	Words might be heard at a distance through all these open	182.7932891845703
2703/3605	The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courte	303.9069519042969
2704/3605	We are cousins it appears Monsieur Porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane	589.5667114257812
2705/3605	The old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and	267.8555603027344
2706/3605	His little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life	1134.9769287109375
2707/3605	Unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony	447.77655029296875
2708/3605	During the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his	239.16787719726562
2709/3605	The cousin was received with resignation that was	323.78955078125
2710/3605	Coquenard firm upon his legs would have declined all relationship with	2261.8837890625
2711/3605	Yes monsieur we are cousins said Porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the	224.63671875
2712/3605	By the female side I believe said the procurator malicious	9442.3740234375
2713/3605	Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large	122.44833374023438
2714/3605	Coquenard who knew that a simpleminded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great	762.9639892578125
2715/3605	Coquenard had since the arrival of Porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak	165.19085693359375
2716/3605	Porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the	275.2481384277344
2717/3605	Oh my legs my poor legs where are you murmured Coquenard and he tried to	577.1597290039062
2718/3605	This succor which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the Musketeer toward the procurators	666.9252319335938
2719/3605	They passed into the eating rooma large dark room situated opposite the	891.3026733398438
2720/3605	The clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit	367.67535400390625
2721/3605	Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threaten	207522.953125
2722/3605	Coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by M	2826.36279296875
2723/3605	Coquenard whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the	339.7724609375
2724/3605	He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his	176.76983642578125
2725/3605	Oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather	405.9883117675781
2726/3605	What the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said Porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipel	350.11614990234375
2727/3605	Coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his	529.2576293945312
2728/3605	Coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient	2784.439208984375
2729/3605	After the soup the maid brought a boiled fowla piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to	265.0523681640625
2730/3605	One may see that you love your family Madame Coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost	758.466064453125
2731/3605	You are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely   The poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their	536.866455078125
2732/3605	The fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch to which it had retired to die of old	93.44799041748047
2733/3605	The devil thought Porthos this is poor	208.19125366210938
2734/3605	I respect old age but I dont much like it boiled or	1561.78076171875
2735/3605	And he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his	158.92332458496094
2736/3605	In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearancean enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show	622.3307495117188
2737/3605	But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned counten	3593.565673828125
2738/3605	Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good house	1543.2203369140625
2739/3605	Coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to Porthos and M	253.63682556152344
2740/3605	The young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do	184.00457763671875
2741/3605	This brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale top	246.19374084472656
2742/3605	Porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurators wife under the table as it came in search of	180.00335693359375
2743/3605	He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuilthe terror of all expert pal	1077.1600341796875
2744/3605	Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed	2862.61767578125
2745/3605	Will you eat any of these beans Cousin Porthos said M	4422.71630859375
2746/3605	Coquenard in that tone which says Take my advice dont touch	809.3152465820312
2747/3605	Devil take me if I taste one of them murmured Porthos to himself and then said aloud Thank you my cousin I am no longer	154.98594665527344
2748/3605	The procurator repeated several times Ah Madame Coquenard Accept my compliments your dinner has been a real	5097.68603515625
2749/3605	Lord how I have eaten  	72.18746185302734
2750/3605	Coquenard had eaten his soup the black feet of the fowl and the only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of	255.36785888671875
2751/3605	Porthos fancied they were mystifying him and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows but the knee of M	673.053955078125
2752/3605	Coquenard gently advised him to be	1625.98779296875
2753/3605	This silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to Porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the	216.42189025878906
2754/3605	Upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from M	1311.9080810546875
2755/3605	Coquenard they arose slowly from the table folded their napkins more slowly still bowed and	2360.09814453125
2756/3605	Go young men go and promote digestion by working said the procurator grave	2867.341552734375
2757/3605	Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and	2772.036865234375
2758/3605	Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good	696.2329711914062
2759/3605	Porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to d	199.52488708496094

2763/3605	Coquenard did not seem to observe	252.0626983642578
2764/3605	This is fine said Porthos to himself I am prettily caught   He passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of M	603.3007202148438
2765/3605	Now said he the sacrifice is consummated Ah if I had not the hope of peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husbands chest  	460.92108154296875
2766/3605	Coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a s	382.131591796875
2767/3605	The procurators wife took Porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a	546.653076171875
2768/3605	You can come and dine three times a week said M	500.062744140625
2769/3605	Thanks madame said Porthos but I dont like to abuse your kindness besides I must think of my outfit   Thats true said the procurators wife groaning that unfortunate outfit   Alas yes said Porthos it is	117.54373168945312
2770/3605	But of what then does the equipment of your company consist Monsieur Porthos   Oh of many things said Porth	80.27279663085938
2771/3605	The Musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen or the	737.9613037109375
2772/3605	Why they may amount to said Porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by	318.4148864746094
2773/3605	I hope it does not exceed She stopped speech failed	2467.093017578125
2774/3605	Oh no said Porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres I even think that with economy I could manage it with two thousand liv	168.49569702148438
2775/3605	Good God cried she two thousand livres Why that is a fortune   Porthos made a most significant grimace M	253.57080078125
2776/3605	I wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business I was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay	380.1321105957031
2777/3605	Ah ah said Porthos that is what you meant to say   Yes dear Monsieur Porth	16.457103729248047
2778/3605	Thus for instance dont you in the first place want a horse   Yes a	99.3813247680664
2779/3605	Well then I can just suit	282.9692077636719
2780/3605	Ah said Porthos brightening thats well as regards my horse but I must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a Musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred liv	390.59564208984375
2781/3605	Three hundred livres Then put down three hundred livres said the procurators wife with a	553.4345703125
2782/3605	It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from	133.4320526123047
2783/3605	These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his	966.2804565429688
2784/3605	Then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my val	79.55136108398438
2785/3605	As to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them I have	153.4770050048828
2786/3605	A horse for your lackey resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my	704.8165893554688
2787/3605	But then you understand Madame Coquenard a mule with feathers and	2643.42529296875
2788/3605	Oh dont let that disturb you cried M	1479.011962890625

2790/3605	There is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the	359.62066650390625
2791/3605	Your valise is then empty asked Porthos with	260.45556640625
2792/3605	Certainly it is empty replied the procurators wife in real	1907.9039306640625
2793/3605	Ah but the valise I want cried Porthos is a wellfilled one my	270.12738037109375
2794/3605	Molière had not written his scene in LAvare	4793.5478515625
2795/3605	Coquenard was in the dilemma of Harp	2097.221923828125
2796/3605	These conditions being agreed to Porthos took leave of M	544.6722412109375
2797/3605	The latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but Porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurators wife was obliged to give place to the	554.3077392578125
2798/3605	The Musketeer returned home hungry and in bad	1169.0789794921875
2799/3605	SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS     Meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of Athos DArtagnan became hourly more in love with Mil	1407.769775390625
2800/3605	Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the selfsatisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to	331.0194091796875
2801/3605	Good thought DArtagnan She is charged with some message for me from her mistress she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to	103.40953063964844
2802/3605	And he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air	451.84637451171875
2803/3605	I wish to say three words to you Monsieur Chevalier stammered the _soubrette	126.85161590576172

2806/3605	Well what is to be done   If Monsieur Chevalier would follow me said Kitty timid	66.2793960571289
2807/3605	And Kitty who had not let go the hand of DArtagnan led him up a little dark winding staircase and after ascending about fifteen steps opened a	147.35372924804688
2808/3605	Come in here Monsieur Chevalier said she here we shall be alone and can	75.58365631103516

2810/3605	She will not hear what we say she never goes to bed before	238.81210327148438
2811/3605	The little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which Kitty said led to Miladys	870.37255859375
2812/3605	Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep	113.40209197998047
2813/3605	You love my mistress then very dearly Monsieur Chevalier said	146.90025329589844
2814/3605	Oh more than I can say Kitty I am mad for her   Kitty breathed a second	410.4336853027344
2815/3605	Alas monsieur said she that is too	50.91366958618164
2816/3605	What the devil do you see so bad in it said DArtagn	30.725807189941406
2817/3605	Because monsieur replied Kitty my mistress loves you not at	292.8257751464844
2818/3605	_Hein_ said DArtagnan can she have charged you to tell me so   Oh no monsieur but out of the regard I have for you I have taken the resolution to tell you	51.86607360839844
2819/3605	Much obliged my dear Kitty but for the intention onlyfor the information you must agree is not likely to be at all	347.2717590332031
2820/3605	That is to say you dont believe what I have told you is it not so   We have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self	80.60546112060547
2821/3605	Then you dont believe me   I confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance   What do you think of this   Kitty drew a little note from her bos	54.55986404418945
2822/3605	For me said DArtagnan seizing the	24.910701751708984
2823/3605	The remembrance of the scene at	233.3590087890625

2825/3605	As quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was	139.89801025390625
2826/3605	Oh good Lord Monsieur Chevalier said she what are you doing   I said DArtagnan nothing and he read   You have not answered my first	38.2689208984375

2830/3605	Poor dear Monsieur dArtagnan said Kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans	78.28756713867188
2831/3605	You pity me little one said DArtagn	85.686767578125
2832/3605	Oh yes and with all my heart for I know what it is to be in	39.24832534790039
2833/3605	You know what it is to be in love said DArtagnan looking at her for the first time with much	28.769222259521484
2834/3605	Well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your	142.3042449951172

2840/3605	Kitty said he I will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like dont let that disturb	221.88162231445312
2841/3605	And he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a	320.13189697265625

2854/3605	Here am I Milady here am I cried Kitty springing forward to meet her	937.2140502929688
2855/3605	Both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open DArtagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her	130.38150024414062
2856/3605	She was at length appeased and the conversation turned upon him while Kitty was assisting her	2058.955078125

2863/3605	I love him I detest him An idiot who held the life of Lord de Winter in his hands and did not kill him by which I missed three hundred thousand livres	175.62342834472656
2864/3605	Thats true said Kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his	404.4490966796875
2865/3605	DArtagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindness	207.93548583984375
2866/3605	For all this continued Milady I should long ago have revenged myself on him if and I dont know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate	184.52279663085938
2867/3605	Oh yes but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond	210.42538452148438

2870/3605	That will do said Milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave	281.7551574707031
2871/3605	To be sure for Monsieur de Ward	676.165283203125
2872/3605	Now there is one said Kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor Monsieur dArtagn	55.088138580322266
2873/3605	Go to bed mademoiselle said Milady I dont like	188.70462036132812
2874/3605	DArtagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which Milady fastened herself	144.86590576171875
2875/3605	On her side but as softly as possible Kitty turned the key of the lock and then DArtagnan opened the closet	144.73382568359375
2876/3605	Oh good Lord said Kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you How pale you are   The abominable creature murmured DArtagn	74.37537384033203
2877/3605	There is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and Miladys every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the	164.49151611328125
2878/3605	Thats exactly the reason I wont go said DArtagn	114.34140014648438
2879/3605	She had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much	397.93304443359375
2880/3605	It was a movement of vengeance upon Mil	170.4995880126953
2881/3605	DArtagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the	90.68897247314453
2882/3605	With a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and	228.60855102539062
2883/3605	It must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of M	370.142822265625
2884/3605	Bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to DArtagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secretsonly she believed she could say she was not	198.31646728515625
2885/3605	As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal Kitty knew nothing about it but this time DArtagnan was better informed than she	148.80445861816406
2886/3605	As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving England he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond stud	135.73826599121094
2887/3605	But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of Milady was increased by his not having killed her brotherin	266.912841796875
2888/3605	DArtagnan came the next day to Miladys and finding her in a very illhumor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from	154.25596618652344
2889/3605	Kitty came in but Milady was very cross with	1293.8309326171875
2890/3605	DArtagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to Milady he had framed a little plan in his	196.67626953125
2891/3605	He found Kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her	196.67288208007812
2892/3605	Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely sc	6873.6083984375
2893/3605	Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes and she ordered Kitty to come at nine oclock in the morning to take a third	184.81320190429688
2894/3605	DArtagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following	72.40581512451172

2896/3605	Things passed as on the night	121.12828826904297
2897/3605	DArtagnan concealed himself in his closet Milady called undressed sent away Kitty and shut the	213.35958862304688
2898/3605	As the night before DArtagnan did not return home till five oclock in the	16.74563217163086
2899/3605	At eleven oclock Kitty came to	192.302001953125
2900/3605	She held in her hand a fresh billet from Mil	231.3633270263672
2901/3605	This time the poor girl did not even argue with DArtagnan she gave it to him at	73.44780731201172
2902/3605	She belonged body and soul to her handsome	1719.5740966796875
2903/3605	DArtagnan opened the letter and read as follows   This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love	21.099355697631836
2904/3605	Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I detest	87.52552795410156
2905/3605	If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the     young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit     may obtain his	126.89276123046875
2906/3605	DArtagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this b	382.6445007324219
2907/3605	Oh you love her still said Kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young mans countenance for an	131.87713623046875
2908/3605	I do not love her but I will avenge myself for her	114.58236694335938
2909/3605	Oh yes I know what sort of vengeance You told me that   What matters it to you Kitty You know it is you alone whom I	100.26566314697266
2910/3605	How can I know that   By the scorn I will throw upon	145.66464233398438
2911/3605	But now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness     since not only your letter but your servant assures me that I have     the good fortune to be beloved by	87.69932556152344
2912/3605	She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit     may obtain his	109.69255065917969
2913/3605	I will come and ask mine at eleven oclock     this	53.368324279785156
2914/3605	To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh    	276.8558654785156
2915/3605	From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men     COMTE DE WARDES     This note was in the first place a forgery it was likewise an indelic	701.0822143554688
2916/3605	It was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do	313.8280029296875
2917/3605	Besides DArtagnan from her own admission knew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for	429.3564147949219
2918/3605	And yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veinspassion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader ple	1960.1031494140625
2919/3605	By Kittys chamber he could gain that of her	716.3966674804688
2920/3605	He would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over	230.74964904785156
2921/3605	He might fail but something must be left to	656.2765502929688
2922/3605	In eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave Paris DArtagnan had no time for a prolonged love	137.42935180664062
2923/3605	There said the young man handing Kitty the letter sealed give that to Mil	886.1947631835938
2924/3605	Poor Kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter	1282.4444580078125
2925/3605	Listen my dear girl said DArtagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or	93.53982543945312
2926/3605	Milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the counts that it is I who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de Ward	248.41482543945312
2927/3605	Milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her	505.8297119140625
2928/3605	Alas said Kitty for whom have I exposed myself to all that   For me I well know my sweet girl said DArtagn	169.26119995117188
2929/3605	But I am grateful I swear to	35.54323196411133
2930/3605	But what does this note contain   Milady will tell	175.83509826660156
2931/3605	Ah you do not love me cried Kitty and I am very	177.73692321777344
2932/3605	To this reproach there is always one response which deludes	4342.599609375
2933/3605	DArtagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great	422.5867614746094
2934/3605	Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all DArtagnan	481.6994934082031
2935/3605	Finally he promised that he would leave her mistresss presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the	191.77574157714844
2936/3605	IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF     Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between	29902.560546875
2937/3605	They dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they	198.51344299316406
2938/3605	This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to find DArtagn	133.28260803222656
2939/3605	Soon as Kitty left him DArtagnan directed his steps toward the Rue Fé	161.96023559570312
2940/3605	Aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cass	432.3161315917969
2941/3605	Athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded	2271.11865234375
2942/3605	Athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free	252.6103057861328
2943/3605	He never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked	218.2581024169922
2944/3605	People in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given	171.79637145996094
2945/3605	The four countenances expressed four different feelings that of Porthos tranquillity that of DArtagnan hope that of Aramis uneasiness that of Athos care	92.98319244384766
2946/3605	At the end of a moments conversation in which Porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his embarrassment Mousqueton	263.1755065917969
2947/3605	He came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously	271.20867919921875
2948/3605	Is it my equipment   Yes and no replied Mousqu	91.40448760986328
2949/3605	Well but cant you speak   Come monsie	44.02440643310547
2950/3605	Porthos rose saluted his friends and followed Mousqu	89.88922119140625
2951/3605	An instant after Bazin made his appearance at the	104.87384033203125
2952/3605	What do you want with me my friend said Aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the	117.99961853027344
2953/3605	A man wishes to see Monsieur at home replied Baz	91.76350402832031

2957/3605	Has he sent no particular message for me  	143.5699920654297
2958/3605	If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come he said tell him I am from	145.7041778564453

2962/3605	What do you think DArtagnan said Ath	8.47488021850586
2963/3605	I know that Porthos was in a fair way replied DArtagnan and as to Aramis to tell you the truth I have never been seriously uneasy on his	36.497005462646484
2964/3605	Go to my dear Athos you have truly inconceivable	253.19215393066406
2965/3605	Oh ay the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice which naturally you took care not to	644.4268798828125
2966/3605	Yes you look there for your outfit I think you	197.91168212890625
2967/3605	I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of Madame Bonacie	167.19337463378906
2968/3605	Yes I understand now to find one woman you court	392.6347961425781
2969/3605	It is the longest road but certainly the most	1093.6956787109375
2970/3605	DArtagnan was on the point of telling Athos all but one consideration restrained	84.87752532958984
2971/3605	Athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this Pur	273.46826171875
2972/3605	He was therefore silent and as Athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth DArtagnans confidence stopped	116.58857727050781
2973/3605	We will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow Aram	98.03132629394531
2974/3605	Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from Tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before Bazin he ran without stopping from the Rue Férou to the Rue de Vaugir	96.3832778930664
2975/3605	On entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with r	277.4230651855469
2976/3605	You have asked for me said the Musket	147.1669464111328
2977/3605	I wish to speak with Monsieur Aram	12.470977783203125
2978/3605	Is that your name monsieur   My very	62.381980895996094
2979/3605	You have brought me something   Yes if you show me a certain embroidered handker	64.07838439941406
2980/3605	Here it is said Aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it	191.9769287109375
2981/3605	That is right replied the mendicant dismiss your lac	375.4419860839844
2982/3605	In fact Bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to	120.74279022216797
2983/3605	At the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to	81.48152923583984
2984/3605	Perform your duty in camp I will do mine	3179.890380859375
2985/3605	Accept that which the bearer brings you make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black	582.3363647460938
2986/3605	Aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript  	1405.4744873046875
2987/3605	You may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of Spain     Golden dreams cried Aram	383.81768798828125
2988/3605	Bazin scratched at the door and as Aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come	124.244140625
2989/3605	Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce DArtagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to Aramis on leaving Ath	51.63460922241211
2990/3605	Now as DArtagnan used no ceremony with Aramis seeing that Bazin forgot to announce him he announced	155.1067657470703

2992/3605	You are mistaken friend DArtagnan said Aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in onesyllable verse which I began y	399.50897216796875
2993/3605	Well your publisher is very generous my dear Aramis thats all I can	369.36651611328125

2998/3605	Bazin perceived he was wrong he bowed and went	144.5177001953125
2999/3605	Ah said DArtagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in	110.48015594482422
3000/3605	You are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your	296.8019714355469
3001/3605	Aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his double	829.9207153320312
3002/3605	My dear DArtagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as I am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your	64.77494812011719

3005/3605	Agreed as to the old Burgundy I have no objection to that said Aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of	177.28561401367188
3006/3605	And having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a tal	323.2363586425781
3007/3605	The two friends repaired to Athoss and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to	327.4129333496094
3008/3605	As he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy DArtagnan and Aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to	134.5846710205078
3009/3605	They went to find Porthos and at the corner of the Rue Bac met Mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a	120.39979553222656
3010/3605	DArtagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from	21.646852493286133
3011/3605	Aramis look at that horse   Oh the frightful brute said Aram	111.50255584716797
3012/3605	Ah my dear replied DArtagnan upon that very horse I came to	63.80647277832031
3013/3605	What does Monsieur know this horse said Mousqu	66.24359893798828
3014/3605	It is of an original color said Aramis I never saw one with such a hide in my	166.56640625
3015/3605	I can well believe it replied DArtagnan and that was why I got three crowns for	55.64286422729492
3016/3605	It must have been for his hide for _certes_ the carcass is not worth eighteen liv	850.3941040039062
3017/3605	She had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent Spanish _genet_ and an Andalusian mule which were beautiful to look	552.5928344726562
3018/3605	The husband heard of the affair on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible	760.7755737304688
3019/3605	Which you are taking back to him said DArtagn	24.105121612548828
3020/3605	You may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to	99.0107650756836
3021/3605	No _pardieu_ though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow	57.759273529052734
3022/3605	That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in	83.20183563232422

3039/3605	There is no harm in trying to buy things cheap Monsieur Porthos said the procurators wife seeking to excuse	426.9041748046875
3040/3605	No madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous	1040.653564453125

3058/3605	He found her in a charming	248.24240112304688
3059/3605	Never had he been so well	71.66344451904297

3061/3605	Her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice Miladys condesc	252.73306274414062
3062/3605	DArtagnan looked at the two women one after the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in their	178.82122802734375

3064/3605	At ten oclock Milady began to appear	321.4850769042969
3065/3605	She looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at DArtagnan with an air which said You are very amiable no doubt but you would be _charming_ if you would only	208.9780731201172
3066/3605	DArtagnan rose and took his hat Milady gave him her hand to	64.7823257446289
3067/3605	The young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his	205.05377197265625
3068/3605	This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great	230.106201171875
3069/3605	It was necessary that DArtagnan should find alone the staircase and the little	75.65231323242188
3070/3605	She heard him enter but she did not raise her	118.63680267333984
3071/3605	The young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed	203.47647094726562
3072/3605	As DArtagnan had presumed on receiving his letter Milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given Kitty a	184.70237731933594
3073/3605	Returning to her own room Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the	787.02734375
3074/3605	The poor girl under the caresses of DArtagnan lifted her	91.84992218017578
3075/3605	DArtagnan himself was frightened by the change in her count	68.31629180908203
3076/3605	She joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a	390.00177001953125
3077/3605	As little sensitive as was the heart of DArtagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in	314.8597106933594
3078/3605	He did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch only he represented his action as one of simple	554.5506591796875
3079/3605	For the rest this vengeance was very easy for Milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered Kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber	270.921875
3080/3605	de Wardes must take his departure still in	3410.505859375
3081/3605	Presently they heard Milady retire to her	555.15625
3082/3605	Hardly was he concealed when the little bell	812.0005493164062
3083/3605	Kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two	153.1329803466797
3084/3605	Milady seemed overcome with joy and made Kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with De Wardes when he received the letter how he had responded what was the expression of his face if he seemed very am	499.08392333984375
3085/3605	And to all these questions poor Kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egot	818.7922973632812
3086/3605	Finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached Milady had everything about her darkened and ordered Kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce De Wardes whenever he presented	793.3695678710938
3087/3605	Hardly had DArtagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when Kitty reclosed the door of	225.4495849609375
3088/3605	It is I said DArtagnan in a subdued voice I the Comte de Ward	162.67601013183594
3089/3605	Oh my God my God murmured Kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named   Well said Milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter Count Count added she you know that I wait for	192.86593627929688
3090/3605	At this appeal DArtagnan drew Kitty quietly away and slipped into the	300.57476806640625
3091/3605	If rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy	820.9812622070312
3092/3605	DArtagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not fore	109.8705825805664
3093/3605	Jealousy gnawed his heart and he suffered almost as much as poor Kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next	322.55902099609375
3094/3605	Yes Count said Milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own I am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have	170.59197998046875
3095/3605	Oh tomorrow tomorrow I must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto DArtagn	139.4550323486328
3096/3605	DArtagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with brill	119.56175994873047
3097/3605	The first movement of DArtagnan was to return it but Milady added No no Keep that ring for love of	228.75881958007812
3098/3605	Besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you	303.3133850097656
3099/3605	This woman is full of mysteries murmured DArtagnan to	59.93266296386719
3100/3605	At that instant he felt himself ready to reveal	163.23423767089844
3101/3605	He even opened his mouth to tell Milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added Poor angel whom that monster of a Gascon barely failed to	528.0423583984375
3102/3605	Oh continued Milady do your wounds still make you suffer   Yes much said DArtagnan who did not well know how to	80.7772216796875
3103/3605	Be tranquil murmured Milady I will avenge youand cruelly   _Peste_ said DArtagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet	105.01411437988281
3104/3605	It took some time for DArtagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely	106.9845199584961

3106/3605	He would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabol	478.960205078125
3107/3605	DArtagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following	522.126953125
3108/3605	Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to DArtagnan when he passed through her chamber but Milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the	134.9722137451172
3109/3605	The next morning DArtagnan ran to find Ath	45.776004791259766
3110/3605	He was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for	155.5569305419922
3111/3605	Your Milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive	127.99262237548828
3112/3605	In one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your	264.5479431152344
3113/3605	While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on DArtagnans finger the place of the queens ring carefully kept in a c	203.01620483398438
3114/3605	You notice my ring said the Gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his	153.2024383544922
3115/3605	Yes said Athos it reminds me of a family	366.3441162109375
3116/3605	It is beautiful is it not said DArtagn	28.948692321777344
3117/3605	I did not think two sapphires of such a fine water	770.1461181640625
3118/3605	Have you traded it for your diamond  	350.4039001464844
3119/3605	It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman or rather Frenchwomanfor I am convinced she was born in France though I have not questioned	296.4625244140625
3120/3605	That ring comes from Milady cried Athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong	256.61328125
3121/3605	Her very self she gave it me last	1103.5306396484375
3122/3605	Here it is replied DArtagnan taking it from his	24.428544998168945
3123/3605	Athos examined it and became very	590.4059448242188
3124/3605	He tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for	198.91729736328125
3125/3605	A shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this	586.2869262695312
3126/3605	It is impossible it can be she said	86.46648406982422
3127/3605	How could this ring come into the hands of Milady Clarik And yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two	526.1299438476562
3128/3605	Do you know this ring said DArtagn	30.082700729370117
3129/3605	I thought I did replied Athos but no doubt I was	66.95686340332031
3130/3605	And he returned DArtagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at	139.45091247558594
3131/3605	Pray DArtagnan said Athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that I shall have no head to converse with	246.95574951171875
3132/3605	Dont ask me for counsel dont tell me you are perplexed what to	309.9581604003906
3133/3605	But stop let me look at that sapphire again the one I mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by	325.2788391113281
3134/3605	DArtagnan took off the ring giving it again to Ath	42.2397575378418
3135/3605	Look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to DArtagnan the scratch he had	76.72752380371094
3136/3605	But from whom did this ring come to you Athos   From my mother who inherited it from her	122.69603729248047
3137/3605	As I told you it is an old family	132.66787719726562
3138/3605	No replied Athos with a singular	30.756591796875
3139/3605	I gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to	66.4472427368164
3140/3605	DArtagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in Miladys soul whose depths were dark and	245.61390686035156
3141/3605	He took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his	99.76605224609375
3142/3605	DArtagnan said Athos taking his hand you know I love you if I had a son I could not love him	33.93254852294922
3143/3605	I do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about	236.03355407714844
3144/3605	You are right said DArtagnan I will have done with	18.145593643188477

3147/3605	On reaching home DArtagnan found Kitty waiting for	266.3818664550781
3148/3605	A month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and	455.2578125

3150/3605	Her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with	2052.17626953125
3151/3605	She wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night and poor Kitty pale and trembling awaited DArtagnans	188.16558837890625

3158/3605	DArtagnan gave the open letter to Kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second	180.2843475341797
3159/3605	She could scarcely believe in her happiness and DArtagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had	84.78404235839844

3164/3605	It is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a	109.28871154785156

3166/3605	She ground her teeth she was of the color of	431.9444274902344

3183/3605	Will it be the same this evening     Your very grateful MILADY CLARIK     Thats all very simple said DArtagnan I expected this	352.02484130859375
3184/3605	My credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Ward	1105.631591796875
3185/3605	Listen to me my dear girl said the Gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive	148.93051147460938
3186/3605	You are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than	115.64360046386719
3187/3605	Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to	1582.0526123046875
3188/3605	DArtagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Mil	127.97035217285156
3189/3605	He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her	183.03663635253906
3190/3605	He did not dare to write for fear of not being ableto such experienced eyes as those of Miladyto disguise his writing	472.8452453613281
3191/3605	As nine oclock sounded DArtagnan was at the Place	34.10969924926758
3192/3605	It was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as DArtagnan appeared before even he had asked if Milady were visible one of them ran to announce	84.32835388183594
3193/3605	Show him in said Milady in a quick tone but so piercing that DArtagnan heard her in the antech	110.21212005615234
3194/3605	I am at home to nobody said Milady observe to _nobody	1588.2696533203125
3195/3605	DArtagnan cast an inquiring glance at Mil	43.15644836425781
3196/3605	She was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of	328.3143615722656
3197/3605	The number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two	300.006591796875
3198/3605	DArtagnan approached her with his usual gall	52.76552200317383
3199/3605	She then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable	328.2805480957031
3200/3605	To the questions which DArtagnan put concerning her health she replied Bad very	628.4937133789062
3201/3605	Then replied he my visit is illtimed you no doubt stand in need of repose and I will	446.7730712890625
3202/3605	On the contrary stay Monsieur dArtagnan your agreeable company will divert	183.4209747314453
3203/3605	She has never been so kind	141.6859893798828
3204/3605	On guard   Milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brillian	228.29481506347656
3205/3605	At the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her	732.0411376953125
3206/3605	DArtagnan was again in the presence of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her enchant	173.66038513183594
3207/3605	His love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his	203.98745727539062
3208/3605	Milady smiled and DArtagnan felt that he could damn himself for that	192.52183532714844
3209/3605	There was a moment at which he felt something like	117.32299041748047
3210/3605	She asked DArtagnan if he had a	25.23442268371582
3211/3605	Have I any need to tell you so Have you not perceived it   It may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be	141.66268920898438
3212/3605	Oh difficulties do not affright me said DArtagn	56.77499008178711
3213/3605	Nothing is impossible replied Milady to true	1354.5455322265625
3214/3605	Nothing madame   Nothing replied Mil	120.5005874633789
3215/3605	Well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you	69.34349822998047
3216/3605	All that could be required of	156.69851684570312
3217/3605	For everything   For everything cried DArtagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself	68.02212524414062
3218/3605	Well now let us talk a little seriously said Milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to DArtagnans	172.4443359375
3219/3605	I am all attention madame said	53.11483383178711
3220/3605	Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said I have an	242.05947875976562
3221/3605	You madame said DArtagnan affecting surprise is that possible my Godgood and beautiful as you are   A mortal	131.7637481689453
3222/3605	Indeed   An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the	122.40345001220703
3223/3605	May I reckon on you as an auxiliary   DArtagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to	270.9963073730469
3224/3605	You may madame said he with	208.2024688720703
3225/3605	My arm and my life belong to you like my	167.1437225341797
3226/3605	Then said Milady since you are as generous as you are loving   She	187.60572814941406
3227/3605	Well replied Milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of imposs	230.73963928222656
3228/3605	Do not overwhelm me with happiness cried DArtagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to	96.2276382446289
3229/3605	You have understood me then dear Monsieur dArtagnan said Mil	33.873497009277344
3230/3605	I could interpret one of your	1035.6768798828125
3231/3605	Then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown   Instantly   But on my part said Milady how should I repay such a service I know these	251.92176818847656
3232/3605	They are men who do nothing for	169.73854064941406
3233/3605	You know the only reply that I desire said DArtagnan the only one worthy of you and of me   And he drew nearer to	50.40886306762695
3234/3605	Well merit this pretended happiness then   I am at your orders said DArtagn	45.129966735839844
3235/3605	Quite certain said Milady with a last	876.6282348632812
3236/3605	Only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes   Who told you that I had been weeping said	156.63150024414062
3237/3605	It appeared to me   Such women as I never weep said Mil	190.90396118164062
3238/3605	So much the better Come tell me his name   Remember that his name is all my	85.35982513427734
3239/3605	Yes you must see what confidence I have in you   You overwhelm me with	101.5650863647461
3240/3605	What is his name   You know	17.39345359802246
3241/3605	It is surely not one of my friends replied DArtagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him	141.8672332763672
3242/3605	If it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried Milady and a threatening glance darted from her	156.9259033203125
3243/3605	Not if it were my own brother cried DArtagnan as if carried away by his	68.1700210571289
3244/3605	Our Gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was	288.7867431640625
3245/3605	Alas do you love nothing else in me asked DArtagn	66.98497009277344
3246/3605	I love you also _you_ said she taking his	244.1768798828125
3247/3605	The warm pressure made DArtagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed Milady attacked	531.3087768554688
3248/3605	Oh if that were so I should lose my reason   And he folded her in his	74.19387817382812
3249/3605	She made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to	249.63168334960938
3250/3605	Her lips were cold it appeared to DArtagnan that he had embraced a	105.52566528320312
3251/3605	He was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by	1884.5184326171875
3252/3605	He almost believed in the tenderness of Milady he almost believed in the crime of De Ward	372.0848083496094
3253/3605	If De Wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed	433.9173278808594
3254/3605	His name is said she in her	88.65869140625
3255/3605	De Wardes I know it cried DArtagn	79.30522155761719
3256/3605	And how do you know it asked Milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his	65.54492950439453
3257/3605	DArtagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an	35.10191345214844
3258/3605	Tell me tell me tell me I say repeated Milady how do you know it   How do I know it said DArtagn	42.3839225769043
3259/3605	I know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes in a saloon where I was showed a ring which he said he had received from	281.6851501464844
3260/3605	The epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of DArtagnans	168.92294311523438
3261/3605	Well I will avenge you of this wretch replied DArtagnan giving himself the airs of Don Japhet of	358.6337890625
3262/3605	Thanks my brave friend cried Milady and when shall I be avenged   Tomorrowimmediatelywhen you please   Milady was about to cry out Immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward DArtagn	305.0710754394531
3263/3605	Besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before	433.093994140625
3264/3605	All this was answered by an expression of DArtagn	39.32320022583008
3265/3605	Tomorrow said he you will be avenged or I shall be	70.31428527832031
3266/3605	No said she you will avenge me but you will not be	56.577430725097656
3267/3605	With women perhaps but not with	875.8865966796875
3268/3605	But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with	118.50263977050781
3269/3605	Fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back	4020.022216796875
3270/3605	And then accompanying the glance with explanatory words That is but too just said she tender	1424.3641357421875
3271/3605	Oh you are an angel exclaimed the young	56.765132904052734
3272/3605	Except that which I ask of you dear	186.9472198486328
3273/3605	But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness   I cannot wait till	40.106353759765625
3274/3605	It will be useless for him to find you	54.66877365112305
3275/3605	She rang the bell and Kitty	1513.68701171875
3276/3605	Go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven oclock we will then terminate this	226.61122131347656
3277/3605	Kitty will conduct you to my	484.6451110839844
3278/3605	The poor girl almost fainted at hearing these	231.7010498046875
3279/3605	Well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue Do as I bid you show the chevalier out and this evening at eleven oclockyou have heard what I	112.12063598632812
3280/3605	It appears that these appointments are all made for eleven oclock thought DArtagnan thats a settled	166.40652465820312
3281/3605	Milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tender	134.16241455078125
3282/3605	But said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of Kitty I must not play the	193.14700317382812
3283/3605	This woman is certainly a great	2241.5693359375
3284/3605	What was most clear in the matter was that DArtagnan loved Milady like a madman and that she did not love him at	61.29377746582031
3285/3605	But he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of	539.7166137695312
3286/3605	He wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce	100.32683563232422
3287/3605	He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in Miladys apartment which was to be seen through the blind	182.0330810546875
3288/3605	It was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the	38.806331634521484
3289/3605	With this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of DArtagn	170.3496551513672
3290/3605	He recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he reentered the hôtel and flew toward Kittys	282.73046875
3291/3605	The poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but Milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise DArtagnan had made and opening the door said Come	137.36187744140625
3292/3605	All this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that DArtagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he	262.1103820800781
3293/3605	He imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in	529.2000732421875
3294/3605	He however darted not the less quickly toward Milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over	2451.170166015625
3295/3605	As the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward	549.1378784179688
3296/3605	This last thought of love counseled her to make this last	570.0546264648438
3297/3605	DArtagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his	39.94525146484375
3298/3605	It was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently	255.8655242919922
3299/3605	A secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but selflove but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murm	283.81256103515625
3300/3605	And then our Gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with De Wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself   He was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the	408.0281982421875
3301/3605	Milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to	604.6571655273438
3302/3605	But DArtagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrust	240.2487030029297
3303/3605	This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady whose questions became more	990.4099731445312
3304/3605	Then DArtagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not	82.44538879394531
3305/3605	Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron	652.1497192382812
3306/3605	DArtagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to renounce by pardoning De Wardes the furious projects she had	1263.644287109375
3307/3605	He shall die then since you condemn him said DArtagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of	145.75531005859375
3308/3605	We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady but DArtagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its pal	171.6749267578125
3309/3605	Seeing DArtagnan about to leave her Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Ward	191.44097900390625
3310/3605	I am quite ready said DArtagnan but in the first place I should like to be certain of one	22.05874252319336
3311/3605	That is whether you really love me   I have given you proof of that it seems to	45.276546478271484
3312/3605	And I am yours body and soul   Thanks my brave lover but as you are satisfied of my love you must in your turn satisfy me of	295.7077331542969
3313/3605	Is it not so   Certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied DArtagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account   What have I to fear   Why that I may be dangerously woundedkilled	55.18062973022461
3314/3605	Impossible cried Milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swords	804.9926147460938
3315/3605	You would not then prefer a method resumed DArtagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless   Milady looked at her lover in	259.9730224609375
3316/3605	The pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful	269.52215576171875
3317/3605	Really said she I believe you now begin to	140.6773223876953
3318/3605	No I do not hesitate but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes since you have ceased to love	318.5016174316406
3319/3605	I think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastis	292.33245849609375
3320/3605	Who told you that I loved him asked Milady	273.30633544921875
3321/3605	At least I am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and I repeat that I am really interested for the	124.97510528564453
3322/3605	And why _you_   Because I alone know   What   That he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he	117.54423522949219
3323/3605	Indeed said Milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for I really cannot tell what you	601.734619140625
3324/3605	And she looked at DArtagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves	82.03546905517578
3325/3605	Yes I am a man of honor said DArtagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and I am satisfied I possess itfor I do possess it do I not   Entirely go	59.94475173950195
3326/3605	Well I feel as if transformeda confession weighs on my	1277.9898681640625
3327/3605	A confession   If I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not   Without	94.51058197021484
3328/3605	Then if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me  	225.14727783203125
3329/3605	DArtagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Miladys but she evaded	244.21612548828125
3330/3605	Do not lie my angel said DArtagnan smiling that would be	112.3255386352539
3331/3605	What do you mean Speak you kill	136.36073303222656
3332/3605	Be satisfied you are not guilty toward me and I have already pardoned	101.67140197753906
3333/3605	What next what next   De Wardes cannot boast of	2577.01953125
3334/3605	How is that You told me yourself that that ring   That ring I have The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the DArtagnan of today are the same	293.68731689453125
3335/3605	The imprudent young man expected a surprise mixed with shamea slight storm which would resolve itself into tears but he was strangely deceived and his error was not of long	475.1622314453125
3336/3605	Pale and trembling Milady repulsed DArtagnans attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of	193.48817443847656
3337/3605	DArtagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen to implore her pardon but she with a strong movement tried to	470.9076843261719
3338/3605	Great God cried DArtagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and	205.49777221679688
3339/3605	But Milady felt herself denounced even by his	2264.42724609375
3340/3605	The young man now knew her secret her terrible secretthe secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except	732.0072631835938
3341/3605	She turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded pant	410.78179931640625
3342/3605	Ah wretch cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret You shall	279.4111022949219
3343/3605	Although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding	733.0320434570312
3344/3605	He recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabb	115.84378051757812
3345/3605	But without taking any heed of the sword Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her	253.15931701660156
3346/3605	Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable	631.3944702148438
3347/3605	As all this however bore some resemblance to a duel DArtagnan began to recover himself little by	194.46426391601562
3348/3605	Well beautiful lady very well said he but _pardieu_ if you dont calm yourself I will design a second _fleurdelis_ upon one of those pretty cheeks   Scoundrel infamous scoundrel howled Mil	542.5443725585938
3349/3605	But DArtagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to Kittys	318.70440673828125
3350/3605	At the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach Kitty opened the	597.4488525390625
3351/3605	DArtagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from	316.4902038574219
3352/3605	With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while Kitty pushed the	438.18560791015625
3353/3605	Then Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the	300.7273254394531
3354/3605	Every blow was accompanied with terrible imprec	355.1191101074219
3355/3605	Quick Kitty quick said DArtagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel for if we leave her time to turn round she will have me killed by the	112.73382568359375
3356/3605	But you cant go out so said Kitty you are	646.1324462890625
3357/3605	Thats true said DArtagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in thats	180.47752380371094
3358/3605	But dress me as well as you are able only make haste think my dear girl its life and death   Kitty was but too well aware of	247.23477172851562
3359/3605	In a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a	1614.6959228515625
3360/3605	She gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the	148.18128967285156
3361/3605	Milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hô	1015.4659423828125
3362/3605	The porter was drawing the cord at the moment Milady cried from her window Dont open   The young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent	242.2327880859375
3363/3605	The moment she lost sight of him Milady tumbled fainting into her	533.9530029296875
3364/3605	The confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his	289.88232421875
3365/3605	He crossed the court ran up the two flights to Athoss apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it	179.55099487304688
3366/3605	Grimaud came rubbing his halfopen eyes to answer this noisy summons and DArtagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lac	413.6758117675781
3367/3605	In spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his	426.5320129394531
3368/3605	Holloa there cried he what do you want you strumpet Whats your business here you hussy   DArtagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the	542.6668090820312
3369/3605	At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a	282.6032409667969
3370/3605	He then concluded it must be an	105.8653564453125
3371/3605	Hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man I am DArtagnan dont you know me Where is your master   You Monsieur dArtagnan cried Grimaud	40.996002197265625
3372/3605	Athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyespetticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with	962.9346923828125
3373/3605	Come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be	172.96702575683594
3374/3605	Well but put on this dressing gown first said the Musketeer to his	382.5168151855469
3375/3605	DArtagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still	380.5755615234375
3376/3605	Well replied DArtagnan bending his mouth to Athoss ear and lowering his voice Milady is marked with a _fleurdelis_ upon her shoulder   Ah cried the Musketeer as if he had received a ball in his	179.4059295654297
3377/3605	Are you _sure_ that the _other_ is dead   _The other_ said Athos in so stifled a voice that DArtagnan scarcely heard	101.70354461669922
3378/3605	Yes she of whom you told me one day at Am	272.9036865234375
3379/3605	Athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his	127.25984191894531
3380/3605	This is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight	159.06639099121094
3381/3605	Fair said Athos is she not  	29.101530075073242
3382/3605	Blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows  	264.2637634277344
3383/3605	Tall wellmade She has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left  	1175.1806640625
3384/3605	The _fleurdelis_ is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices  	799.5077514648438
3385/3605	But you say she is English   She is called Milady but she may be	140.04652404785156
3386/3605	Lord de Winter is only her brotherin	108.61588287353516
3387/3605	I will see her DArtagnan   Beware Athos	98.42195892333984
3388/3605	You tried to kill her she is a woman to return you the like and not to	129.43423461914062
3389/3605	She will not dare to say anything that would be to denounce	113.09698486328125
3390/3605	She is capable of anything or	377.45330810546875
3391/3605	Did you ever see her furious   No said Ath	58.49127960205078
3392/3605	A tigress a panther Ah my dear Athos I am greatly afraid I have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us   DArtagnan then related allthe mad passion of Milady and her menaces of	222.36087036132812
3393/3605	You are right and upon my soul I would give my life for a hair said Ath	66.22594451904297
3394/3605	Fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave	96.94537353515625
3395/3605	We are going according to all probability to La Rochelle and once gone   She will follow you to the end of the world Athos if she recognizes	98.90497589111328
3396/3605	Let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone   My dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said Ath	163.08392333984375
3397/3605	Do you perchance think I set any great store by life   There is something horribly mysterious under all this Athos this woman is one of the cardinals spies I am sure of	204.85890197753906
3398/3605	If you go out do not go out alone when you eat use every	309.2027893066406
3399/3605	Mistrust everything in short even your own	1392.9322509765625
3400/3605	Fortunately said DArtagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have I hope only men to	111.42293548583984
3401/3605	In the meantime said Athos I renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go I will go with	144.91558837890625
3402/3605	You must return to the Rue des Fossoyeurs I will accompany	106.18704986572266
3403/3605	But however near it may be replied DArtagnan I cannot go thither in this	68.77384185791016
3404/3605	Thats true said Athos and he rang the	109.75450134277344
3405/3605	Athos made him a sign to go to DArtagnans residence and bring back some	129.30938720703125
3406/3605	Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set	435.2062072753906
3407/3605	All this will not advance your outfit said Athos for if I am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with Milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to	134.85757446289062
3408/3605	The jewel is yours my dear Athos Did you not tell me it was a family jewel   Yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told	114.86151885986328
3409/3605	It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is	162.47129821777344
3410/3605	My mother gave it to me and I fool as I was instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic gave it to this w	189.82911682128906
3411/3605	Then my friend take back this ring to which I see you attach much	445.6989440917969
3412/3605	I take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature Never that ring is defiled DArtagn	251.72914123535156
3413/3605	Sell a jewel which came from my mother I vow I should consider it a profan	497.1759033203125
3414/3605	Pledge it then you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on	185.97357177734375
3415/3605	With that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of us	527.16357421875
3416/3605	You are a capital companion DArtagnan said he your neverfailing cheerfulness raises poor souls in aff	702.7362670898438
3417/3605	Well let us pledge the ring but upon one	264.12103271484375
3418/3605	What   That there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for	39.07343292236328
3419/3605	I dont need the quarter of such a sumI who am still only in the Guardsand by selling my saddles I shall procure	437.6195068359375
3420/3605	What do I want A horse for Planchet thats	145.88833618164062
3421/3605	Besides you forget that I have a ring	223.5362548828125
3422/3605	To which you attach more value it seems than I do to mine at least I have thought	144.3064422607422
3423/3605	Yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great	464.60748291015625
3424/3605	It is not only a valuable diamond but it is an enchanted tal	1492.631103515625
3425/3605	I dont at all understand you but I believe all you say to be	95.9203872680664
3426/3605	Let us return to my ring or rather to	261.72418212890625
3427/3605	You shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or I will throw it into the Seine and I doubt as was the case with Polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to	387.6816711425781
3428/3605	Well I will take it then said DArtagn	15.344842910766602
3429/3605	At this moment Grimaud returned accompanied by Planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments	121.13983917236328
3430/3605	DArtagnan dressed himself and Athos did the	20.75243377685547
3431/3605	When the two were ready to go out the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his	186.92735290527344
3432/3605	They arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoye	282.308837890625
3433/3605	Bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at DArtagnan hate	39.87270736694336
3434/3605	Make haste dear lodger said he there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs and you know women dont like to be kept	528.2138671875
3435/3605	Thats Kitty said DArtagnan to himself and darted into the	53.79682540893555
3436/3605	Sure enough Upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a trem	174.71482849121094
3437/3605	As soon as she perceived him she cried You have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her	138.4492645263672
3438/3605	Remember it is you who have ruined me   Yes yes to be sure Kitty said DArtagnan be at ease my	72.3896255493164
3439/3605	But what happened after my departure   How can I tell said	243.35345458984375
3440/3605	The lackeys were brought by the cries she	212.19654846191406
3441/3605	There exist no imprecations she did not pour out against	639.017822265625
3442/3605	Then I thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose I was your accomplice so I took what little money I had and the best of my things and I got	208.12583923339844
3443/3605	Poor dear girl But what can I do with you I am going away the day after	52.634639739990234
3444/3605	Help me out of Paris help me out of France   I cannot take you however to the siege of La Rochelle said DArtagn	49.3081169128418
3445/3605	No but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for	189.72088623046875
3446/3605	My dear little love In my country the ladies do without chambermaid	1673.5130615234375
3447/3605	But stop I can manage your business for	166.89205932617188
3448/3605	We have something very important to say to	86.06956481933594
3449/3605	I understand said Athos but why not Porthos I should have thought that his duchess   Oh Porthoss duchess is dressed by her husbands clerks said DArtagnan	49.62468338012695
3450/3605	Besides Kitty would not like to live in the Rue aux O	1107.3321533203125
3451/3605	Isnt it so Kitty   I do not care where I live said Kitty provided I am well concealed and nobody knows where I	353.7430725097656
3452/3605	Meanwhile Kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me   Monsieur Chevalier far off or near said Kitty I shall always love	120.91927337646484
3453/3605	Where the devil will constancy niche itself next murmured Ath	962.2980346679688

3456/3605	I attach great importance to the question I am about to put to	78.89424133300781
3457/3605	I cried Athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an add	154.33056640625
3458/3605	You to be sure said DArtagnan pressing Athoss	33.920467376708984
3459/3605	You know the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacie	441.5033874511719
3460/3605	Besides Kitty will tell nothing will you Kitty You understand my dear girl continued DArtagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came	229.34432983398438
3461/3605	Oh my God You remind me of my fright If he should have known me again   How know you again Did you ever see that man before   He came twice to Milad	196.95518493652344

3463/3605	Yesterday evening   Yes just before you	174.37649536132812
3464/3605	My dear Athos we are enveloped in a network of	132.21034240722656
3465/3605	And do you believe he knew you again Kitty   I pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him but perhaps it was too	199.8392791748047
3466/3605	Go down Athoshe mistrusts you less than meand see if he be still at his	349.02532958984375
3467/3605	He has gone said he and the house door is	200.13299560546875
3468/3605	He has gone to make his report and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dove	491.5506896972656
3469/3605	Well then let us all fly said Athos and leave nobody here but Planchet to bring us	177.86367797851562
3470/3605	Aramis whom we have sent for   Thats true said Athos we must wait for Aram	41.48697280883789
3471/3605	The matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for	210.64222717285156
3472/3605	Aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring Will it be really rendering you a service DArtagnan   I shall be grateful to you all my	127.07719421386719
3473/3605	Madame de BoisTracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces I believe for a trustworthy	2321.000244140625
3474/3605	If you can my dear DArtagnan answer for Mademoiselle   Oh monsieur be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting	27.47608757019043
3475/3605	Then said Aramis this falls out very	231.24884033203125
3476/3605	He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to	138.35951232910156
3477/3605	And now my dear girl said DArtagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be	28.001598358154297

3479/3605	And whenever we find each other in whatever place it may be said Kitty you will find me loving you as I love you	183.81112670898438
3480/3605	Dicers oaths said Athos while DArtagnan went to conduct Kitty	374.24676513671875
3481/3605	An instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four oclock with Athos and leaving Planchet to guard the	153.33047485351562
3482/3605	Aramis returned home and Athos and DArtagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapp	366.2923889160156
3483/3605	As the Gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the	90.81005096435547
3484/3605	Still further the Jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for	155.5794219970703
3485/3605	Athos and DArtagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musket	128.1639862060547
3486/3605	Besides Athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers	103.19791412353516
3487/3605	When a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abat	1416.2115478515625
3488/3605	The Musketeer met with a superb Andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six	1126.8680419921875
3489/3605	He examined him and found him sound and without blem	457.6138610839844
3490/3605	They asked a thousand livres for	86.15308380126953

3492/3605	Grimaud had a stout short Picard cob which cost three hundred liv	3275.86279296875

3494/3605	DArtagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when	93.42375183105469
3495/3605	But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his	97.2005615234375
3496/3605	How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said Ath	247.7158660888672
3497/3605	That is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for	62.47694396972656
3498/3605	Well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the Jews	130.78150939941406
3499/3605	What will you   This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the	145.30848693847656
3500/3605	Go and tell him the ring is his DArtagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with	52.75957107543945
3501/3605	Reflect Athos   Ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make	270.5671081542969
3502/3605	Go DArtagnan go Grimaud will accompany you with his musket	116.8281021118164
3503/3605	A half hour afterward DArtagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any	87.18675231933594
3504/3605	It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not	142.2300262451172
3505/3605	A VISION     At four oclock the four friends were all assembled with Ath	147.77732849121094
3506/3605	Their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquietfor behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the	532.0463256835938
3507/3605	Suddenly Planchet entered bringing two letters for DArtagn	39.17576217651367
3508/3605	The one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green	3411.615234375
3509/3605	The other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his Eminence the cardinal d	172.88003540039062
3510/3605	At the sight of the little letter the heart of DArtagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his	63.864376068115234
3511/3605	He therefore seized the little epistle and opened it	252.05224609375
3512/3605	Thats a snare said Athos dont go DArtagn	75.04443359375
3513/3605	And yet replied DArtagnan I think I recognize the	42.146034240722656
3514/3605	Between six and seven oclock the road of Chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of Bond	476.519287109375
3515/3605	But suppose we all go said DArtagnan what the devil They wont devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all   And besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said Porth	220.27587890625
3516/3605	But if it is a woman who writes said Aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her DArtagnan which is not the part of a	105.21460723876953
3517/3605	We will remain in the background said Porthos and he will advance	72.05496215820312
3518/3605	Yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gall	229.30848693847656
3519/3605	Bah said DArtagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in	116.6967544555664
3520/3605	Besides we must try our own	320.5790100097656
3521/3605	Bah let us enjoy that pleasure said Aramis with his mild and careless	138.88076782226562
3522/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by	156.95726013183594
3523/3605	Besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said Porthos and that will be a	63.61978530883789
3524/3605	But this second letter said Athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be	227.9830322265625
3525/3605	For my part I declare DArtagnan I think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bos	136.7330780029297
3526/3605	Well said he let us see gentlemen what are his Eminences commands and DArtagnan unsealed the letter and read  	120.75666809082031

3528/3605	LA HOUDINIERE _Captain of the Guards_     The devil said Athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the	775.2590942382812
3529/3605	I will go to the second after attending the first said DArtagn	44.28569030761719
3530/3605	One is for seven oclock and the other for eight there will be time for	103.73895263671875
3531/3605	Hum I would not go at all said Aram	36.80268478393555
3532/3605	A gallant knight cannot decline a rendezvous with a lady but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his Eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his	456.4712219238281
3533/3605	I am of Aramiss opinion said Porth	68.87603759765625
3534/3605	Gentlemen replied DArtagnan I have already received by Monsieur de Cavois a similar invitation from his Emin	255.92666625976562
3535/3605	I neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meConstance	1154.5252685546875
3536/3605	If you are determined said Athos do	46.37698745727539
3537/3605	Bah you will get me out if they put me there said DArtagn	30.47405242919922
3538/3605	Let us do better than that said Athos do not let us leave him during the whole	43.37192153930664
3539/3605	Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three Musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon	355.6079406738281
3540/3605	It is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal Monsieur de Tréville must think us	71.93391418457031
3541/3605	To a certainty Athos said Aramis you were meant to be a general of the army What do you think of the plan gentlemen   Admirable replied the young men in	95.51991271972656
3542/3605	Well said Porthos I will run to the hôtel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight oclock the rendezvous the Place du PalaisCard	349.91485595703125
3543/3605	Meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the	262.1134948730469
3544/3605	I have no horse said DArtagnan but that is of no consequence I can take one of Monsieur de Trév	33.09677505493164
3545/3605	That is not worth while said Aramis you can have one of	68.84504699707031
3546/3605	One of yours how many have you then asked DArtagn	41.645545959472656
3547/3605	_Certes_ cried Athos you are the bestmounted poet of France or Nav	2253.941162109375
3548/3605	Well my dear Aramis you dont want three horses I cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three   Therefore I only purchased two said Aram	194.76930236816406
3549/3605	The third then fell from the clouds I suppose   No the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his	109.42768096923828
3550/3605	That makes no difference said Aramis coloring and who affirmed as I said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it	519.767578125
3551/3605	It is only to poets that such things happen said Athos grave	175.84263610839844
3552/3605	Well in that case we can manage famously said DArtagnan which of the two horses will you ridethat which you bought or the one that was given to you   That which was given to me assured	146.0382537841797
3553/3605	You cannot for a moment imagine DArtagnan that I would commit such an offense toward   The unknown giver interrupted DArtagn	163.82086181640625
3554/3605	The one you bought will then become useless to you   Nearly	252.62774658203125
3555/3605	And you selected it yourself   With the greatest	129.76058959960938

3557/3605	Well transfer it to me at the price it cost you   I was going to make you the offer my dear DArtagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a tr	83.47269439697266
3558/3605	How much did it cost you   Eight hundred liv	213.75152587890625
3559/3605	Here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said DArtagnan taking the sum from his pocket I know that is the coin in which you were paid for your	68.70970153808594
3560/3605	Rich Richest my dear fellow   And DArtagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his	106.89009094238281
3561/3605	Send your saddle then to the hôtel of the Musketeers and your horse can be brought back with	171.135498046875
3562/3605	Very well but it is already five oclock so make	140.4552001953125
3563/3605	A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue Férou on a very handsome _genet	76.23359680175781

3565/3605	Porthos was resplendent with joy and	165.78750610351562
3566/3605	At the same time Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb English	139.21466064453125
3567/3605	Bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse this was DArtagnans	727.452392578125
3568/3605	The two Musketeers met at the	209.1826629638672
3569/3605	Athos and DArtagnan watched their approach from the	89.51683807373047
3570/3605	The devil cried Aramis you have a magnificent horse there Porth	99.8359146118164
3571/3605	Yes replied Porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at	29.725950241088867

3576/3605	Near the Louvre the four friends met with	78.79247283935547

3579/3605	DArtagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to	32.69676208496094
3580/3605	de Tréville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinals	85.7628402709961
3581/3605	It is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the	40.877952575683594
3582/3605	de Tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he	124.25800323486328
3583/3605	At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of	739.1611938476562
3584/3605	A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot the day began to decline carriages were passing and rep	1120.7750244140625
3585/3605	DArtagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was	125.74015808105469
3586/3605	At length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of Sèv	215.83065795898438
3587/3605	A presentiment instantly told DArtagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so	100.76106262207031
3588/3605	Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a	449.07403564453125
3589/3605	DArtagnan uttered a slight cry of joy this woman or rather this apparitionfor the carriage passed with the rapidity of a visionwas M	126.44857025146484
3590/3605	By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given DArtagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had	202.22984313964844
3591/3605	DArtagnan then remembered the injunction If you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen	125.82107543945312
3592/3605	He stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rend	351.8511962890625

3595/3605	All had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except Athos knew M	533.5302734375
3596/3605	The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than DArtagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a mans head inside the	139.3059539794922
3597/3605	If that be the case said DArtagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to	171.95701599121094
3598/3605	But what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall I ever meet her again   Friend said Athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this	70.82512664794922
3599/3605	You know something of that as well as I do I	46.45401382446289

3602/3605	The carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time	238.9683837890625
