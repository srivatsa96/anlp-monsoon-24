160/28840	I never meddle in intrigues and if I occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them	49.95162582397461

182/28840	He was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marion	100.46887969970703
183/28840	The cardinal folded and sealed his	535.171630859375

191/28840	His prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which De Bassompierre supposed for after the death of Richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his	62.83108901977539

200/28840	He had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner	108.98847961425781
201/28840	On seeing him DArtagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of	17.544036865234375
202/28840	The prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musket	45.20658493041992

210/28840	And for what crime are you imprisoned in the Bast	57.535797119140625
211/28840	Do you wish me to speak the truth  	28.67523956298828
212/28840	Have you any suspicion of me Rochefort   No on the honor of a gentleman but I cannot be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is	34.01020050048828
213/28840	For stealing you Rochefort you are laughing at	82.39115142822266
214/28840	You mean that this demands explanation do you not   I admit	51.41978454589844
215/28840	Were you crazy Rochefort at your age   No I was	74.80481719970703
216/28840	And yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze	69.73466491699219

265/28840	DArtagnan let me confess to you what Ive been thinking about during the whole of my drive as I looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery	83.71553039550781

277/28840	As he gazed at him Mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say This is a man who does not appear to me fit for	46.90691375732422
278/28840	After a pause which appeared an age to Rochefort Mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said   I find here a letter in which you sue for liberty Monsieur de Roche	43.26258850097656
279/28840	You are in prison then   Rochefort trembled in every limb at this	36.331336975097656
280/28840	Yes but in regard to myself my lord it cannot be so for I was removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your em	39.708984375
281/28840	Ah stay I fancy I remember	145.99501037597656
282/28840	Did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to Brussels for the queen   Ah ah exclaimed Roche	51.98007583618164
283/28840	There is the true reason Idiot that I am though I have been trying to find it out for five years I never found it	38.08572769165039
284/28840	But I do not say it was the cause of your	27.386205673217773
285/28840	I merely ask you did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal   That is the very reason I refused to go back to	39.68206024169922
286/28840	I was there at a fearful	81.79938507080078

288/28840	How could I then return to Brussels I should injure the queen instead of serving	101.87114715576172
289/28840	Since I was a faithful servant my lord to Cardinal Richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death I should serve you well in defiance of the whole	71.89673614501953
290/28840	With regard to myself Monsieur de Rochefort replied Mazarin I am not like Monsieur de Richelieu all	16.272336959838867

306/28840	As for me I play my game squarely fairly and above board as I always	137.4574737548828
307/28840	Are you one of us Monsieur de Rochefort   I am very desirous of being so my lord but I am totally in the dark about	20.307525634765625
308/28840	In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort I am of Monsieur de Bassompierres	70.37150573730469
309/28840	Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France   He is dead sir a great	92.4145278930664
310/28840	His devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are	206.21217346191406
311/28840	I think so forsooth said Rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the Bast	48.427616119384766
312/28840	However there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my	66.05497741699219
313/28840	Ah my dear Monsieur de Rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal Ah he was a great	29.673446655273438
314/28840	Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson   I never you know you may say anything to	54.7171516418457
315/28840	I try to be beloved not	409.8240966796875
316/28840	Well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says Like master like	125.49786376953125
317/28840	Pray what does that mean   It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of	49.06486511230469
318/28840	But those men you speak of said Mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against	89.38077545166016
319/28840	No in that case they would have met with more fitting	72.97846984863281
320/28840	They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking	151.9794921875
321/28840	Ah said Mazarin with admirable suavity could I but find such men   My lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by	93.67123413085938
322/28840	Who is it   It is Monsieur dArtagn	7.5472307205200195
323/28840	That Gascon cried Mazarin with well acted	137.37496948242188
324/28840	That Gascon has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a ty	70.51164245605469
325/28840	Really   It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excell	15.708562850952148
326/28840	Tell me a little about it my dear Monsieur de Roche	26.92911720275879
327/28840	That is somewhat difficult my lord said Rochefort with a	31.994178771972656
328/28840	Then he will tell it me	555.6957397460938
329/28840	Why do you doubt it   Because the secret does not belong to him because as I have told you it has to do with a great	33.1395149230957
330/28840	And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that   No my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just	83.8577880859375
331/28840	And were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united   As if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one	131.0597381591797
332/28840	You pique my curiosity dear Rochefort pray tell me the whole	154.76513671875
333/28840	That is impossible but I will tell you a true story my	37.02973556518555
334/28840	Pray do so I delight in stories cried the	445.7195739746094
335/28840	Listen then returned Rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals	60.06913375854492
336/28840	Once upon a time there lived a queena powerful monarchwho reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too	144.2178497314453
337/28840	Do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen re	146.69256591796875
338/28840	There came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like	76.51995849609375
339/28840	As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queens appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take	83.1435317993164
340/28840	There is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond	79.83503723144531
341/28840	This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from her high	184.40370178222656
342/28840	Indeed   Well my lord four men resolved to save	53.75251770019531
343/28840	These four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even	198.36404418945312
344/28840	They were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted	136.46615600585938
345/28840	The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their	123.80237579345703
346/28840	Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop	117.91024780273438
347/28840	He crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the	71.5046157836914
348/28840	What do you think of that exploit my lord   It is magnificent said Mazarin thought	22.55864715576172
349/28840	Well I know of ten such	223.23480224609375
350/28840	You have nothing more to ask of me my lord said Roche	29.455549240112305
351/28840	And you say that Monsieur dArtagnan was one of those four men   He led the	21.304346084594727
352/28840	And who were the others   I leave it to Monsieur dArtagnan to name them my	29.27228355407715
353/28840	They were his friends and not	338.9185791015625
354/28840	He alone would have any influence with them I do not even know them under their true	76.59329986572266
355/28840	You suspect me Monsieur de Rochefort I want him and you and all to aid	39.127349853515625
356/28840	Begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to ones	64.65034484863281
357/28840	You my dear Monsieur de Rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go to Vincennes where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined you will guard him well for	25.128767013549805
358/28840	Well what is the matter   The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said Rochefort shaking his head with an air of	21.903324127197266
359/28840	What impossible And why is it impossible   Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends or rather I am one of	20.52806854248047
360/28840	Have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen   Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the	29.074413299560547
361/28840	That may be my lord but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your	66.23257446289062
362/28840	This then is what you call devotion I congratulate	129.12435913085938
363/28840	Your devotion does not commit you too far Monsieur de Roche	44.6115837097168
364/28840	And then my lord continued Rochefort you understand that to emerge from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change ones	58.98335266113281
365/28840	Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said Maz	29.222660064697266
366/28840	My lord I have been so long shut up that I am only of one partyI am for fresh	116.67588806152344
367/28840	Employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high	104.64286041259766
368/28840	My dear Monsieur de Rochefort Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails	35.90110778808594
369/28840	Believe me you ought now to take a	303.3123474121094
370/28840	Here   You decide then nothing about me my lord   On the contrary I have come to a	37.281612396240234
371/28840	Call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low	40.276573181152344
372/28840	Mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he	184.30850219726562
373/28840	I see my lord I am to be taken back to the Bast	18.46917152404785
374/28840	I shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ	45.593292236328125
375/28840	You the friend of my greatest foes Dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me Monsieur de Roche	29.836889266967773
376/28840	I shall find many men as able as you	70.6594009399414
377/28840	I wish you may my lord replied De Roche	40.507606506347656
378/28840	He was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where DArtagnan was	18.575000762939453
379/28840	In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his	38.125701904296875
380/28840	Anne of Austria at the Age of Fortys	100.74256134033203
381/28840	When left alone with Bernouin Mazarin was for some minutes lost in	73.01842498779297
382/28840	He had gained much information but not	250.57803344726562
383/28840	Mazarin was a cheat at the card	403.965087890625
384/28840	This is a detail preserved to us by Brien	201.85218811035156
385/28840	He now determined not to begin the game with DArtagnan till he knew completely all his adversarys	85.81671142578125
386/28840	My lord have you any commands asked Bernou	73.1765365600586

388/28840	Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the	72.16024017333984
389/28840	There was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of	56.65715408325195
390/28840	This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais	42.84798812866211
391/28840	Anne reclining in a large easychair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with	37.3813591003418
392/28840	This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with	170.5534210205078
393/28840	It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or	220.59469604492188
394/28840	When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his	38.777652740478516
395/28840	Why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience   Anne colored	191.2520294189453
396/28840	The prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the	91.8313980102539
397/28840	But Richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious	98.95356750488281
398/28840	How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did You were too young to know about such	53.334632873535156
399/28840	I do not remember what he did but I have inquired and I have been told all about	41.93064498901367
400/28840	And who told you about it asked Anne of Austria with a movement of impat	33.924720764160156
401/28840	I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if I do I shall learn nothing	91.76411437988281
402/28840	The king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand	89.6015625
403/28840	Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful	1146.7025146484375
404/28840	They explained what had occurred that	330.8699645996094
405/28840	He bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy Louis	111.67453002929688
406/28840	had entertained toward Mazarin and he endeavored to receive the ministers homage with civ	67.68526458740234
407/28840	Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had	89.2480239868164
408/28840	The minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais   It is time for the king to go to bed call Laport	44.08740234375
409/28840	The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with	65.65184783935547
410/28840	In a few minutes Laporte came into the	19.915916442871094
411/28840	The child went directly to him without kissing his	184.46983337402344
412/28840	Well Louis said Anne why do you not kiss me   I thought you were angry with me madame you sent me	42.99887466430664
413/28840	I do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire	64.50482177734375
414/28840	You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to	79.48799896240234
415/28840	Sire interposed Laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle   To any one Laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except Manc	47.386783599853516
416/28840	Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarins and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the	115.91942596435547
417/28840	And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the	43.481292724609375
418/28840	Good said Mazarin I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissim	22.745769500732422
419/28840	Why do you say that asked the queen almost timid	59.74776077270508
420/28840	Why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no	40.826778411865234
421/28840	Besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for	129.4788818359375
422/28840	That however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as I am to that of your	45.597476959228516
423/28840	I ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to	44.458717346191406
424/28840	But continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important	70.7283706665039
425/28840	What is it then   Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his count	23.690505981445312
426/28840	It is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to	63.082027435302734
427/28840	Why cried the queen how is that   Because as they say in the opera of Thisbe The whole world conspires to break our	78.7174072265625
428/28840	You jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former	68.23890686035156

466/28840	Well madame said Mazarin bowing I desire that you give me a share in your friends as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given	45.05750274658203
467/28840	The circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act	76.21495056152344
468/28840	I thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beau	37.14567565917969

474/28840	But he is mistaken I shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling	88.93518829345703
475/28840	Anne blushed and buried her face in her	56.81718063354492

478/28840	Anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful You are insulting me she	66.05497741699219

480/28840	I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all I tell you   Madame I do not ask you to tell me said Mazarin astounded by this returning	51.40663146972656

484/28840	What relics are those by which you swear asked Mazarin	165.55050659179688
485/28840	The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the	118.13101196289062
486/28840	Open sir she said and look for	97.7244644165039
487/28840	Mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his	173.25213623046875
488/28840	What are these things replied Anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still	191.6488494873047
489/28840	These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to	184.8560333251953

492/28840	But Mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the	63.7181510925293
493/28840	The blade was red for the blood had become rust after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary	84.7538070678711

496/28840	Do you think she said with a ghastly smile that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations   Mazarin overcome by this determination read the two	57.884727478027344
497/28840	In one the queen asked for the ornaments back	80.87419128417969
498/28840	This letter had been conveyed by DArtagnan and had arrived in	34.94217300415039

500/28840	It is well madame said Mazarin nothing can gainsay such	84.93650817871094
501/28840	As she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her	49.05244445800781
502/28840	It appears she resumed that he sold ithe sold it in order to save me another timeto be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his dangerhe sold it to Monsieur des Essarts on whose finger I remarked	56.73063278198242
503/28840	I bought it from him but it belongs to DArtagn	24.603595733642578
504/28840	Give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him	65.55121612548828

510/28840	Do you permit me to return   Yes	37.178466796875
511/28840	The cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his	32.986244201660156

513/28840	Laporte pointed to the child who was	74.83842468261719
514/28840	Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking Bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left	44.70198059082031
515/28840	When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antech	25.939382553100586

524/28840	Possibly thought DArtagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for Mazarins	78.24860382080078
525/28840	Well continued Mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your val	88.03492736816406
526/28840	There was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of Mazarins	66.6656494140625

529/28840	Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my	61.6338996887207
530/28840	It is true I fought with tolerable	275.10284423828125
531/28840	I dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said Mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by	63.180973052978516
532/28840	Well you do not reply resumed Maz	58.680015563964844
533/28840	I am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you	41.888851165771484
534/28840	I speak of the adventureEh you know well what I	31.288612365722656
535/28840	Alas no my lord replied DArtagnan	47.15082931518555

539/28840	Bravo cried Mazarin they told me that you were the man I	94.77982330322266

541/28840	Everything that your eminence may please to command me was the	81.01302337646484
542/28840	You will do for me what you have done for the queen   Certainly DArtagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak	19.868541717529297
543/28840	Hes not more cunning than De Richelieu was Devil take him Then he said aloud   The queen my lord I dont	71.6444091796875

545/28840	Of former days my lord In former days I had not only three friends I had thirty at twoandtwenty one calls every man ones	129.46090698242188
546/28840	Well sir returned Mazarin prudence is a fine thing but today you might regret having been too	96.43746948242188
547/28840	My lord Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their	187.1787872314453
548/28840	But you have been silent for twenty years	78.2510986328125
549/28840	Speak now the queen herself releases you from your	114.22663879394531
550/28840	The queen said DArtagnan with an astonishment which this time was not	40.751827239990234
551/28840	Yes the queen And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you	65.41557312011719
552/28840	I remember well that diamond which belonged to the	63.0731201171875
553/28840	You see then that I speak to you in the queens	49.97442626953125
554/28840	Answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so	88.81792449951172
555/28840	Faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten	37.46436309814453
556/28840	We need only a week to amend all	111.26567077636719
557/28840	Come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends   I do not know my	19.850345611572266
558/28840	We have parted company this long time all three have left the	340.5614318847656
559/28840	Where can you find them then   Wherever they are thats my	70.45000457763672
560/28840	Well now what are your conditions if I employ you   Money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will	66.71736145019531
561/28840	I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which I was obliged to sell we should have remained on the	72.62310028076172
562/28840	The devil he does Money and a large sum said Maz	76.84205627441406
563/28840	Pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury   Do then as I did my	49.31495666503906
564/28840	Trust me dont let us try to do things	149.32696533203125
565/28840	Great undertakings come poorly off with paltry	251.15196228027344
566/28840	Well returned Mazarin we will satisfy	77.17845153808594
567/28840	Richelieu thought DArtagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in	36.305076599121094
568/28840	You will then be at my service asked Maz	29.890409469604492
569/28840	But if they refuse can I count on you   I have never accomplished anything alone said DArtagnan shaking his	33.267906188964844
570/28840	What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence   You know them better than	32.68271255493164
571/28840	Adapt your promises to their respective	272.1693115234375
572/28840	What shall I promise   That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be	75.57976531982422
573/28840	But what are we to do   Make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your	59.125301361083984
574/28840	My lord perhaps they are not in	74.70308685302734
575/28840	It is even probable that I shall have to make a	49.91408920288086
576/28840	I am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost	115.6245346069336
577/28840	My intention said Mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant	88.22579193115234
578/28840	Still my lord I cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and I cant travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service I have accumulated nothing but	74.37417602539062
579/28840	If these are Spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought DArtagnan we shall yet be able to do business	46.81888198852539
580/28840	He saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense	68.72916412353516
581/28840	Well then all is settled you are to set off said the	83.17093658447266
582/28840	Younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family	133.31910705566406
583/28840	These Gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the Italians in effron	95.41271209716797
584/28840	At all events answered DArtagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their	49.336669921875
585/28840	He then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of	71.3052978515625
586/28840	Crown pieces onlysilver pieces I suspected	726.3252563476562
587/28840	Ah Mazarin Mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it   Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great	67.14400482177734
588/28840	In the meantime DArtagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne where he lived at the Hotel de la Chev	9.92591381072998
589/28840	We will explain in a few words how DArtagnan had been led to choose that place of	72.49833679199219
590/28840	Years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of The Three Musketeers we took leave of DArtagnan at	103.9353256225586
591/28840	DArtagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to	34.39214324951172
592/28840	So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his	59.33351135253906
593/28840	He was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of	46.21116256713867
594/28840	Athos imparted to him his greatness of soul Porthos his enthusiasm Aramis his	182.1809539794922
595/28840	Had DArtagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior	45.23334503173828
596/28840	Athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois Porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly Aramis the third to take orders and become an abb	64.59220123291016
597/28840	From that day DArtagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from	66.2395248413086
598/28840	Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers DArtagnan felt completely	97.79298400878906
599/28840	For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees eff	112.75236511230469
600/28840	A garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly DArtagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became I know not how in the present age one would express it a typical	90.95496368408203
601/28840	These important advantages DArtagnan found to his own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the	24.867578506469727
602/28840	He was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken	136.6285400390625
603/28840	Bigamy my dear Come now you dont really wish it   But he is dead I am sure of	45.45636749267578
604/28840	He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us	170.09666442871094
605/28840	All right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so	73.89736938476562
606/28840	Peste my darling another way of getting	275.99212646484375
607/28840	So you refuse my request   To be sure I dofuriously   The pretty landlady was	48.60199737548828
608/28840	She would have taken DArtagnan not only as her husband but as her God he was so handsome and had so fierce a	57.86375045776367
609/28840	Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of FrancheCom	182.22760009765625
610/28840	DArtagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to	41.80030822753906
611/28840	There were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithfulall of course on the part of the host	153.3412322998047
612/28840	DArtagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his	60.00990676879883
613/28840	As to that we know DArtagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of	46.9030647277832
614/28840	He had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give	85.9415283203125
615/28840	One believes readily what he wishes to	299.6691589355469
616/28840	Now in the army from the divisiongenerals who desire the death of the generalinchief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some ones	81.61669158935547
617/28840	But DArtagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like	21.771326065063477
618/28840	After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield the cool freshness of the night brought him to	80.32464599609375
619/28840	He gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in	102.73619079589844
620/28840	He was petted tended cured and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for	168.956298828125
621/28840	Once in France he turned his course toward Paris and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiqueton	63.85112380981445
622/28840	But DArtagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the	59.2190055847168
623/28840	So much the worse and so much the better   It need not be said that DArtagnan was still thinking of the	23.85525894165039
624/28840	He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a	100.19656372070312
625/28840	Monsieur has returned then   Of course naively replied the	50.83893966674805
626/28840	If I had any money said DArtagnan to himself I would go away but I have	22.745119094848633
627/28840	I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune appar	57.22251892089844
628/28840	Is that monsieur said DArtagnan to	8.606708526611328
629/28840	Oh oh he has grown a good deal it seems to	40.589962005615234
630/28840	And he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous	84.31356048583984
631/28840	The hostess as she entered saw DArtagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon DArtagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tender	42.971134185791016
632/28840	The Swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned	33.86286926269531
633/28840	Ah it is you monsieur What do you want of me she asked in great	29.73381805419922
634/28840	Is monsieur your cousin Is monsieur your brother said DArtagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was	36.13060760498047
635/28840	And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian who received him with great cold	34.854915618896484
636/28840	Monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gas	40.96539306640625
637/28840	Your husband then is at last dead   How does that concern you replied the	66.59534454345703
638/28840	It concerns me much said DArtagnan since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since   And since asked the	61.532352447509766
639/28840	And sinceI do not give it said the musket	42.34486770629883
640/28840	The Swiss became as purple as a pe	257.3954162597656
641/28840	He wore his elegant uniform DArtagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the Swiss was six feet high DArtagnan was hardly more than five the Swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded DArtagnan as an	60.6647834777832
642/28840	Will you go away from here demanded the Swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously	88.72103881835938
643/28840	Some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so	90.39590454101562
644/28840	DArtagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction   Stay you where you are and dont you stir or I will pull this ear	109.07603454589844
645/28840	As for you illustrious descendant of William Tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another	130.52096557617188
646/28840	And why   Ah very well said DArtagnan I see that you understand	18.36513900756836
647/28840	Come then and take a turn with me and I will	64.21698760986328
648/28840	The hostess who knew DArtagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her	64.76512908935547
649/28840	DArtagnan turned toward her saying Then send him away mad	65.20567321777344
650/28840	It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of	87.16127014160156
651/28840	DArtagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the Swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his	52.556915283203125
652/28840	Then you will lie here said DArtagn	34.233585357666016
653/28840	It is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen	51.46399688720703
654/28840	With these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his	54.20728302001953
655/28840	He had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all	151.0289764404297
656/28840	The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit	98.3711929321289
657/28840	There said DArtagnan what did I tell you Fortunately you wont be laid up more than a	36.40231704711914
658/28840	Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the	140.0463104248047
659/28840	Goodby Oh by the way youd better take lodging in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pel	114.97216033935547
660/28840	You will be well fed there if the hostess remains the	60.6016960144043
661/28840	Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss the things that belonged to	81.5577163696289
662/28840	The boy found him sitting where DArtagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his	40.16993713378906
663/28840	The boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for DArtagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve lab	71.89488983154297
664/28840	But when he was alone with the hostess he said Now pretty Madeleine you know the difference between a Swiss and a	39.61393356323242
665/28840	As for you you have acted like a barm	132.2913818359375
666/28840	So much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my	62.008628845214844
667/28840	I have driven away the Swiss to humiliate you but I shall lodge here no	62.74806213378906
668/28840	I will not sleep where I must	84.8582992553711
669/28840	Ho there boy Have my valise carried to the Muid dAmour Rue des Bourdonna	133.77906799316406
670/28840	In saying these words DArtagnan appeared at the same time majestic and g	27.781978607177734
671/28840	The hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet	112.1387710571289
672/28840	What more need be said The spit turned the stove roared the pretty Madeleine wept DArtagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and	108.46092224121094
673/28840	He pardoned and having pardoned he	112.96876525878906
674/28840	And this explains how DArtagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne at the Hotel de la Chev	15.634827613830566
675/28840	DArtagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying Mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that	59.68756866455078
676/28840	Then I should like to have three sons I should make the first a nobleman like Athos the second a good soldier like Porthos the third an excellent abbé like Aram	79.15398406982422
677/28840	Faith that would be a far better life than I lead now but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch who wont dispossess himself of his diamond in my	124.44881439208984
678/28840	On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the	42.338348388671875
679/28840	Oho said he is the hotel on fire On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was	99.44024658203125
680/28840	The people were shouting and running about with	233.11978149414062
681/28840	By the light of one of these torches DArtagnan perceived men in	67.9157485961914
682/28840	In his youth DArtagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a	51.002418518066406
683/28840	There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good Burg	55.149723052978516
684/28840	He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his	100.95525360107422
685/28840	He had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the	82.6186294555664
686/28840	His first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to	86.4031753540039
687/28840	Not to reflect on what had passed as one might	179.47506713867188
688/28840	No DArtagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper	63.80757141113281
689/28840	He was hungry he supped he went to	112.06521606445312
690/28840	Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with	113.4889144897461
691/28840	In the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of	116.42752075195312
692/28840	It was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always slept all night	82.75804138183594
693/28840	At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his	58.39271545410156
694/28840	In 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal I received a letter from Ath	48.80214309692383
695/28840	Where was I then Let me	84.3260269165039
696/28840	Oh at the siege of Besancon I was in the	118.54061889648438
697/28840	Let me see with regard to Porthos I received a letter from him	49.49551773071289
698/28840	He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of September 16	70.0221176147461
699/28840	Unluckily as I was then in Bearn on account of my fathers death the letter followed me	138.52737426757812
700/28840	I had left Bearn when it arrived and I never received it until the month of April 1647 and as the invitation was for September 1646 I couldnt accept	77.2833023071289
701/28840	Let me look for this letter it must be with my title	129.5410614013672
702/28840	DArtagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his	37.06315994262695
703/28840	He uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy	46.38892364501953
704/28840	DArtagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the Chateau du Vall	21.469886779785156
705/28840	Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vall	43.4888916015625
706/28840	Devil take the vain fellow said DArtagn	63.92628479003906
707/28840	However I had better find him out first since he cant want	240.43917846679688
708/28840	Athos must have become an idiot by this time from	185.95840454101562
709/28840	Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflex	137.9300079345703
710/28840	He cast his eyes again on the	59.29331588745117
711/28840	There was a postscript   I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his	42.857017517089844
712/28840	In his convent What convent There are about two hundred in Paris and three thousand in France and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his	154.4775848388672
713/28840	Well suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries It would be a curious idea and maybe I should find my friend under the name of	87.63807678222656
714/28840	But no I should lose myself in the cardinals	73.22540283203125
715/28840	Great people only thank you for doing the impossible whats possible they say they can effect themselves and they are	218.3554229736328
716/28840	But let us wait a little and	115.77767944335938
717/28840	I received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact I rendered	84.32501220703125
718/28840	Yes yes but now what did I do with that letter   DArtagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old	26.925214767456055
719/28840	He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its	59.3597412109375
720/28840	As I am of the church and the affair might injure me if I should share it with any other than a sure friend like you I write to beg that you will serve me as	67.54434204101562
721/28840	You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine under the second lamp on the right you will find your	42.712669372558594
722/28840	I shall be with mine under the	78.28585052490234
723/28840	He had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty swordstroke on the arm then had gone toward Aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his	64.92467498779297
724/28840	I think I have killed the insolent	30.397991180419922
725/28840	But dear friend if you ever need me you know that I am entirely devoted to	25.410198211669922
726/28840	Thereupon Aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arc	49.953521728515625
727/28840	So then he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room	73.14917755126953
728/28840	He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was	114.8097152709961
729/28840	He was not mistaken as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the	58.37779235839844
730/28840	Ah you scoundrel cried DArtagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his	34.34587860107422
731/28840	Sir cried the man in the name of Heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me	76.86077880859375
732/28840	Im no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my	86.21160125732422
733/28840	My name isah but surely you are Monsieur dArtagnan   And thouPlanchet cried the	28.810054779052734
734/28840	At your service sir said Planchet overwhelmed with joy if I were still capable of serving	50.21207046508789
735/28840	Sir said the prudent Planchet in the first place are you on good terms with Monsieur de Rochefort   Perfectly one of my dearest	20.63071632385254
736/28840	Ah so much the better   But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room   Ah sir I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is   Planchet	19.572460174560547
737/28840	Egad I know where he is said DArtagn	25.569665908813477
738/28840	That is to say he was there replied Planc	28.928560256958008
739/28840	But in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse	56.70350646972656
740/28840	The prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for	147.47146606445312
741/28840	I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the Duc de Beaufort who called for	21.29351806640625
742/28840	The people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and Monsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the	67.30257415771484
743/28840	At this moment a patrol passed	138.71974182128906
744/28840	I was obliged to sound a retreat toward the Rue Tiquetonne I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where I have been concealed between two matt	48.51569747924805
745/28840	This morning I ventured to run along the gutters and   Well interrupted DArtagnan I am delighted that De Rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the kings servants they will hang thee without	59.728450775146484
746/28840	Nevertheless I promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though I risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that I gave one rebel an	122.29737854003906
747/28840	Ah sir you know well I would risk my life for	47.09675598144531
748/28840	Thou mayst add that thou hast risked it Planc	238.55953979492188
749/28840	I have not forgotten all I owe	46.85024642944336
750/28840	Sit down there and eat in	333.2848815917969
751/28840	I see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my	177.7639617919922
752/28840	Yes sir for all Ive had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on	93.1768798828125
753/28840	Although I dont despise sweet things in proper time and place I found the supper rather	294.1743469238281
754/28840	Ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried Planc	29.151397705078125
755/28840	And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the Rue des Fossoyeurs whilst DArtagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of Planchet under present	44.61294937133789
756/28840	While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up for lost time at	128.82177734375
757/28840	At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his	48.64262771606445
758/28840	Come said DArtagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where Athos is   No sir replied Planc	25.610885620117188

765/28840	DArtagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go	24.30179786682129
766/28840	Sir said Planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate Think if I am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a	46.440956115722656

772/28840	DArtagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire Madeleine to come	32.48476791381836
773/28840	When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planc	66.60881042480469
774/28840	My dear landlady said DArtagnan I beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from Flanders and whom I am going to take into my	30.358226776123047

784/28840	It was like having a spy in the enemys	71.5697021484375
785/28840	In this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet pleased with himself DArtagnan reached Notre	63.57899475097656
786/28840	He ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew Monsieur Baz	65.98760986328125
787/28840	Monsieur Bazin the beadle said the ver	41.747833251953125

789/28840	DArtagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding Bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other	54.363243103027344
790/28840	He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at Baz	55.78318405151367
791/28840	Bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propri	110.35469055175781

793/28840	It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone	124.52485656738281
794/28840	Bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a	57.71998596191406
795/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan he cried Vade retro Satanas   So my dear Bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old	30.974998474121094
796/28840	Sir replied Bazin the true friends of a Christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing	76.08622741699219
797/28840	I dont understand you Bazin nor can I see how I can be a stumblingblock in the way of your salvation said DArtagn	28.253767013549805
798/28840	You forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the	78.2879409790039
799/28840	My dear Bazin you ought to perceive said DArtagnan from the place in which you find me that I am greatly changed in	46.0769157409668
800/28840	Age produces good sense and as I doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation I want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to	50.445674896240234
801/28840	Rather say to take him back with you into the	70.91255187988281
802/28840	Fortunately I dont know where he	20.037778854370117
803/28840	How cried DArtagnan you dont know where Aramis is   Formerly replied Bazin Aramis was his name of perd	31.976806640625
804/28840	By Aramis is meant Simara which is the name of a	88.06637573242188
805/28840	Happily for him he has ceased to bear that	90.57565307617188
806/28840	And therefore said DArtagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not Aramis I seek but the Abbé dHerbl	22.291519165039062
807/28840	Come my dear Bazin tell me where he	23.789384841918945
808/28840	Didnt you hear me tell you Monsieur dArtagnan that I dont know where he is   Yes certainly but to that I answer that it is	21.628917694091797
809/28840	It is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good	101.19933319091797
810/28840	DArtagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of Aramis but whose lies were bold and	63.151123046875
811/28840	Well Bazin said DArtagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good	41.11149597167969

814/28840	Incorruptible murmured DArtagnan I am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind	76.72533416748047
815/28840	DArtagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the	26.586172103881836
816/28840	He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of	38.14662170410156

829/28840	On honor   What then is there surprising in that  	31.762935638427734
830/28840	And in whose behalf are you looking for them   You are in no doubt on that	52.93301773071289
831/28840	Unfortunately I have no idea where they	80.84481048583984

839/28840	Theres no second Constance in the	61.78110885620117
840/28840	On his return to the cathedral DArtagnan saw Bazin who was conversing with the sacrist	22.123905181884766
841/28840	Bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous	636.6791381835938
842/28840	DArtagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to	29.081844329833984
843/28840	DArtagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes it was impossible that Bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing	33.091156005859375
844/28840	In five minutes Bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no	51.2943115234375
845/28840	Calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre	92.10723876953125
846/28840	Afraid of making any inquiries at this house DArtagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocr	44.71243667602539
847/28840	This beverage required a good halfhour to	201.52578735351562
848/28840	And DArtagnan had time therefore to watch Bazin unsus	36.86174011230469
849/28840	He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chor	58.93893051147461
850/28840	He questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving DArtagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the	43.40242004394531
851/28840	Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of Bazins	132.03790283203125
852/28840	Look said the boy theres our beadle who is going a	148.98423767089844
853/28840	And where is he going asked DArtagn	30.432907104492188
854/28840	Half a pistole if you can find out said DArtagn	30.480525970458984
855/28840	For me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if I can find out where Bazin is going That is not	93.32005310058594
856/28840	You are not joking are you   No on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it	38.13644027709961
857/28840	Just the very way not to	373.7254943847656
858/28840	Wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find	233.45262145996094
859/28840	The halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his	39.26853942871094
860/28840	I understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de	62.4346809387207
861/28840	Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding	55.48934555053711
862/28840	Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full	38.90940475463867
863/28840	Before ten minutes had elapsed the child	198.5297393798828
864/28840	Well answered the boy the thing is	145.6282501220703
865/28840	Where is he gone   The halfpistole is for me   Doubtless answer	25.549829483032227
866/28840	Give it me that I may see it is not	87.69982147216797
867/28840	The child put the piece of money into his	107.42266845703125
868/28840	And now where is he gone inquired DArtagn	36.391910552978516
869/28840	How dost thou know   Ah faith there was no great cunning	79.1169662475586
870/28840	I knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to	141.35951232910156
871/28840	Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was	91.17943572998047
872/28840	And he answered that Monsieur Bazin went to No	38.98516845703125

876/28840	DArtagnan wrote the childs name in his	30.781702041625977
877/28840	Please sir said the boy do you think I can gain any more halfpistoles in any way   Perhaps replied DArtagn	30.80697250366211
878/28840	And having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the Rue Tiqueton	51.668792724609375
879/28840	DArtagnan Going to a Distance to discover Aram	25.191761016845703
880/28840	On entering the hotel DArtagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the	31.668169021606445
881/28840	It was Planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that DArtagnan himself could hardly recognize	54.607994079589844
882/28840	Madeleine introduced him in presence of all the	118.206298828125
883/28840	Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded Madeleines brother entered DArtagnans	114.50556945800781
884/28840	The plan adopted by DArtagnan was soon	42.526981353759766
885/28840	He resolved not to reach Noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for Noisy is only three or four leagues from Paris on the road to Me	55.858909606933594
886/28840	A most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de la Chevrette for the discovery of Planc	46.485599517822266
887/28840	At about a league and a half from the city DArtagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing	46.05130386352539
888/28840	The inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly	76.07247924804688
889/28840	A man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to	36.51934051513672
890/28840	At four oclock DArtagnan recommenced his	21.98004722595215
891/28840	He proceeded slowly and in deep rever	66.6377182006836
892/28840	Planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the	83.11388397216797
893/28840	One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to DArtagnans deliberations this was the name of Madame de Longue	33.54021453857422
894/28840	That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce	531.6922607421875
895/28840	Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also one of the greatest beauties at	38.55813980102539
896/28840	She had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the Place Royale by the Duc de Gu	49.021995544433594
897/28840	He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful Madame de Longue	45.03227996826172
898/28840	He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when Planchet approached and said   I will lay a wager your honor that you and I are thinking of the same	52.085960388183594
899/28840	I doubt it Planchet replied DArtagnan but what are you thinking of   I am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we	35.95827865600586
900/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan Planchets recital agreeing with his own	20.62966537475586
901/28840	Well   One of these two men said He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening for I have seen his	53.92808151245117
902/28840	Art thou sure said the man in the	158.65362548828125
903/28840	If he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with	161.78378295898438
904/28840	What to do with him answered the	43.623836517333984
905/28840	Yes hes not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow hell defend	74.06376647949219
906/28840	Well we must try to take him	81.59385681152344
907/28840	Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth   We	113.84616088867188
908/28840	Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horse	84.37677764892578
909/28840	Yes yes my lord dont be	73.62471771240234
910/28840	You will assure us that justice   Yes yes I answer for all that the prince	61.757896423339844
911/28840	Having said that they went out of the	51.68048858642578
912/28840	Well what matters all that to us said DArtagn	46.3525390625
913/28840	This is one of those attempts that happen every	75.27811431884766
914/28840	Are you sure that we are not its objects   We Why   Just remember what they	69.3797836303711
915/28840	I have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to	86.17868041992188
916/28840	Well   He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to	46.1568489074707
917/28840	What else   Then the prince said Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musket	42.72261047363281
918/28840	Now then what do you say to that   Alas my dear Planchet said DArtagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate	31.42660140991211
919/28840	Those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no gr	464.8725280761719
920/28840	Is your honor sure   I can answer for it they do	45.52782440185547
921/28840	Well we wont speak of it any more then and Planchet took his place in DArtagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not	60.758460998535156
922/28840	They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up to DArtagn	54.7571907043457
923/28840	Stop sir look yonder he whispered dont you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows I fancy I hear horses	354.8085021972656
924/28840	The ground is soaking wet yet I fancy as thou sayest that I see	263.04315185546875
925/28840	At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and	186.7073211669922
926/28840	There are men somewhere about but thats of no consequence to us said DArtagnan let us ride	74.14330291748047
927/28840	At about halfpast eight oclock they reached the first houses in Noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the	33.817718505859375
928/28840	The obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of	167.55787658691406
929/28840	Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like perid	123.52941131591797
930/28840	These were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the	210.33489990234375
931/28840	Toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous limet	75.6914291381836
932/28840	This he said to Planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair Madame de Longueville but the convent where is that   The convent your honor is at the other end of the village I know it	31.27525520324707
933/28840	Well then Planchet gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horses girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits	64.17375946044922
934/28840	Sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted	82.87406921386719

936/28840	If I were a monk I should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and	144.44937133789062
937/28840	Yes added Planchet like the famous ass of Bur	70.92570495605469
938/28840	Shall I knock   Hush replied DArtagnan the light no longer burns in yonder	49.43011474609375
939/28840	What is that noise   There came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded DArtagnan and Planc	53.25446701049805
940/28840	Heyday cried DArtagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken is it really for us that you mean your attack   Here he is we have him cried the horsemen rushing on DArtagnan with naked	48.78398513793945
941/28840	Dont let him escape said a loud	78.84246063232422
942/28840	No my lord be assured we shall	51.57551574707031
943/28840	DArtagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the	27.494049072265625
944/28840	Halloo gentlemen he called out in his Gascon accent what do you want what do you demand   That thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horse	61.96376419067383
945/28840	Stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his	156.0596160888672
946/28840	Ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into a passion at random at Noisy Take care for I warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my swordand my sword is longI rip him	113.28449249267578
947/28840	The chieftain of the party drew	149.69461059570312
948/28840	What are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to	41.50799560546875
949/28840	And youwhat are you doing here replied DArtagn	18.416933059692383
950/28840	Be civil or I shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones	173.2509002685547
951/28840	You dont choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned DArtagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant I have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my	44.39769744873047
952/28840	Do you know Monsieur dArtagnan   Lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are Monsieur dArtagnan   I	10.373132705688477
953/28840	Then you came here to defend him   Him whom   The man we are	61.780609130859375
954/28840	It seems said DArtagnan that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of	44.95562744140625
955/28840	Come replied the same lofty tone answer Are you waiting for him underneath these windows Did you come to Noisy to defend him   I am waiting for no one replied DArtagnan who was beginning to be	43.30797576904297
956/28840	I propose to defend no one but myself and I shall defend myself vigorously I give you	68.53166198730469
957/28840	Very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to	78.21588897705078
958/28840	Our blow has failed for tonight let us	223.69842529296875
959/28840	We shall meet again Master dArtagnan continued the leader raising his	65.59571075439453
960/28840	Yes but never with the same advantages said DArtagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be	31.47083282470703
961/28840	Very good very good said the	146.9742431640625
962/28840	And the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to	51.352901458740234
963/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their	41.65511703491211
964/28840	Thou seest simpleton said DArtagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to	61.30242919921875
965/28840	But to whom then   Ifaith I neither know nor	99.20590209960938
966/28840	What I do care for now is to make my way into the Jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their	95.37891387939453
967/28840	Happen what will the devil take them they cant eat	252.94357299804688
968/28840	Planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank	61.51671600341797
969/28840	Hey your honor cried Planchet Ive a man behind	55.78126907348633
970/28840	DArtagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchets	69.6063003540039
971/28840	Tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new	97.8449935913086
972/28840	No no dear DArtagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis Aramis gallop fast Planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the	40.66267395019531
973/28840	And Planchet with Aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by DArtagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic	26.844167709350586
974/28840	At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of Aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in	41.96724319458008
975/28840	Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three	36.03369140625
976/28840	Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from	221.20457458496094
977/28840	My friend said Aramis if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to receive	44.754512786865234
978/28840	Ah said DArtagnan is that the way you return to your apartment   After nine at night pardieu said Aramis the rule of the convent is very	40.20467758178711
979/28840	Pardon me my dear friend said DArtagnan I think you said pardieu   Do you think so said Aramis smiling it is	15.371711730957031
980/28840	You have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom I am obliged to	105.61808776855469
981/28840	But will you not go up   Pass on before me I beg of	52.16789627075195
982/28840	As the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way s	56.128849029541016
983/28840	And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an	73.90863800048828
984/28840	DArtagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was	49.38663864135742
985/28840	I beg your pardon said Aramis noticing his awkwardness if I had known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardeners ladder but for me alone this is good	41.8090705871582
986/28840	Sir said Planchet when he saw DArtagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you in case of necessity I might also climb up but my two horses cannot mount the	52.467323303222656
987/28840	Take them to yonder shed my friend said Aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and	103.07064056396484
988/28840	Marry forsooth people dont die of hunger	405.0321044921875
989/28840	And Aramis drawing in the ladder closed the	140.83163452148438
990/28840	Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more	79.193359375
991/28840	At each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de Lorraine the Cardinal de Richelieu the Cardinal de la Valette and the Archbishop of Borde	74.39282989501953
992/28840	Exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abb	41.0834846496582
993/28840	You are examining my den said Aram	73.4898910522461
994/28840	Ah my dear fellow excuse me I am lodged like a Chartre	76.6688232421875
995/28840	But what are you looking for   I am looking for the person who let down the	40.922847747802734
996/28840	I see no one and yet the ladder didnt come down of	323.6575622558594
997/28840	But continued Aramis Bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that I was not alone he discreetly	90.09214782714844
998/28840	Sit down my dear friend and let us	46.15210723876953
999/28840	And Aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which DArtagnan stretched himself	40.629268646240234
1000/28840	In the first place you will sup with me will you not asked Aram	22.12616729736328
1001/28840	Yes if you really wish it said DArtagnan and even with great pleasure I confess the journey has given me a devil of an	42.25452423095703
1002/28840	Ah my poor friend said Aramis you will find meagre fare you were not	50.68882369995117
1003/28840	Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur   Oh let us hope said Aramis that with the help of God and of Bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit	66.80296325683594
1004/28840	The door opened and Bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of	29.965160369873047
1005/28840	So far well said Aramis we are dying of	88.08863067626953
1006/28840	Serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good	325.9918518066406
1007/28840	Bazin bowed low sighed and left the	88.51034545898438
1008/28840	Now we are alone dear Aramis said DArtagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchets	40.17824935913086
1009/28840	Ifaith answered Aramis as you see from	75.25251770019531
1010/28840	From Heaven replied DArtagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going	48.30315017700195
1011/28840	My friend said Aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which DArtagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if I did not come from Heaven at least I was leaving Paradise which is almost the	31.84709930419922
1012/28840	Paradise is at Noisy le Sec upon the site of the archbishops chate	42.93598937988281
1013/28840	Aramis burst into a fit of	42.942108154296875
1014/28840	You were always a merry companion my dear DArtagnan he said and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted	49.9769401550293
1015/28840	Yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is Madame de Longueville with whom I am in	24.188743591308594
1016/28840	A plague ont I shall not do	40.68939208984375
1017/28840	Eventually she was obliged to leave	95.11471557617188
1018/28840	He was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued Aramis glancing at the portrait of the old	72.49584197998047
1019/28840	For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear Marie I know only one other woman who can do it as	126.39286804199219
1020/28840	So they made this song about her _Laboissiere dis moi	277.0185546875
1021/28840	You know it dont you   No sing it	129.82693481445312
1022/28840	Aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively	154.42684936523438
1023/28840	Bravo cried DArtagnan you sing charmingly dear Aram	87.67276763916016
1024/28840	I do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your	81.5126953125
1025/28840	My dear DArtagnan replied Aramis you understand when I was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could now when I am an abbé I say as few masses as I	38.03431701660156
1026/28840	Whichthe Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville   Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville Little flirtations perhaps and thats	21.524246215820312
1027/28840	No I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse did you see her after her return from Brussels after the kings death   Yes she is still	37.39348220825195
1028/28840	Yes said Aramis I saw her also at that	30.669965744018555
1029/28840	I gave her good advice by which she did not	65.83303833007812
1030/28840	I ventured to tell her that Mazarin was the lover of Anne of	25.304025650024414
1031/28840	She wouldnt believe me saying that she knew Anne of Austria who was too proud to love such a worthless cox	65.94970703125
1032/28840	After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of Beaufort and the coxcomb arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de Chevre	46.66763687133789
1033/28840	You know resumed DArtagnan that she has had leave to return to France   Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or	41.96750259399414
1034/28840	Oh but this time perhaps she will follow your	86.35099792480469
1035/28840	Oh this time returned Aramis I havent seen her she is much	85.22431182861328
1036/28840	In that respect unlike you my dear Aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a pre	100.56056213378906
1037/28840	Yes replied Aramis I am extremely careful of my	37.616615295410156
1038/28840	Do you know that I am growing old I am nearly thirty	53.47187042236328
1039/28840	Indeed Then tis I who am mistaken for you have always been a good chron	43.87018585205078
1040/28840	By your reckoning I must be fortythree at	156.4405059814453
1041/28840	The devil I am Dont let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abb	41.15361785888672
1042/28840	Why what in the world cried Aramis is that animal Bazin doing Bazin Hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst   Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each	78.29985046386719
1043/28840	But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on	77.11018371582031
1044/28840	Bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his	69.95470428466797
1045/28840	DArtagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abbé dHerblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the Musketeer Aramis remained staring with wideopen eyes at the face of his	35.240787506103516
1046/28840	Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that DArtagnan was quite	52.177310943603516
1047/28840	But you expected some one then asked the	142.25396728515625
1048/28840	Oh said Aramis I always try to be prepared and then I knew you were seeking	45.383888244628906
1049/28840	From whom   From Master Bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musket	48.77946090698242
1050/28840	Oh monsieur said Bazin clasping his hands supplicating	18.007022857666016
1051/28840	Come no hypocrisy you know that I dont like	72.26174926757812
1052/28840	You will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his	56.693153381347656
1053/28840	Planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed	106.55178833007812
1054/28840	Bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to Planchet who then went satisfied to his	68.67308044433594
1055/28840	The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable	60.770198822021484
1056/28840	The deuce cried DArtagnan do you live in this way always   Yes pretty	33.3400993347168
1057/28840	Nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said DArtagn	38.3985710144043
1058/28840	What can you expect replied Aramis in a tone of	35.486839294433594
1059/28840	Every man thats born must fulfil his	1065.1405029296875
1060/28840	If it be not an indelicate question resumed DArtagnan have you grown rich   Oh Heaven	62.31864929199219
1061/28840	I make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave	45.829898834228516
1062/28840	And how do you make your twelve thousand francs By your poems   No I have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram I compose sermons my	107.01519775390625
1063/28840	What sermons Do you preach them   No I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great or	69.95130920410156
1064/28840	Ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself   I should my dear DArtagnan have been so but nature said	53.45943069458008
1065/28840	When I am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me I look at her again if she smiles I smile	134.99545288085938
1066/28840	Then I speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of	142.06686401367188
1067/28840	An event took place in the Church of	115.63026428222656
1068/28840	I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of	102.29243469238281
1069/28840	Tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbélike all other abb	39.88728332519531
1070/28840	And what was the end of the affair   We met in the Place RoyaleEgad you know about	44.337284088134766
1071/28840	Was I not your second cried DArtagn	57.79484176635742

1073/28840	Did he die   I dont	32.26254653930664
1074/28840	But at all events I gave him absolution in articulo mort	29.21485710144043
1075/28840	Tis enough to kill the body without killing the	155.7631378173828
1076/28840	Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was	139.04953002929688
1077/28840	Bazin my friend said Aramis you dont seem to be aware that I can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all I have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprob	38.39302444458008
1078/28840	You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to	56.41926574707031
1079/28840	Besides my friend DArtagnan has something to say to me privately have you not DArtagnan   DArtagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired after placing on the table the Spanish	24.311574935913086
1080/28840	The two friends left alone remained silent face to	193.10003662109375
1081/28840	Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion DArtagnan to be preparing his exord	43.3942756652832
1082/28840	Each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly	53.078636169433594
1083/28840	It was Aramis who broke the	137.5541229248047
1084/28840	What are you thinking of DArtagnan he	22.36380958557129
1085/28840	I was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musket	40.61320114135742
1086/28840	Tis true man as you know said Aramis is a strange animal made up of	57.10533905029297
1087/28840	Since I became an abbé I dream of nothing but	68.62371826171875

1093/28840	Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men   Undoubtedly said Aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if I could have drawn without being	38.32614517211914
1094/28840	Well I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please prince though he	81.98001861572266
1095/28840	Hold on wait said Aramis that is an idea   Of which I invite you to take advantage my	58.04019546508789
1096/28840	Let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich Answer	64.85780334472656

1098/28840	Peste a hundred pistoles said DArtagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as Job If I had them I should think myself as rich as Croes	59.208927154541016
1099/28840	Then aloud Are you ambitious   As Encelad	54.42962646484375
1100/28840	Well my friend I bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you	82.54203796386719
1101/28840	The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramiss face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape DArtagnans	71.6351547241211
1102/28840	Do you take any interest in politics   A gleam of light shone in Aramiss eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by DArtagn	31.52593994140625
1103/28840	Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but God   It is	67.1337890625
1104/28840	Have you my dear Aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play   Certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious	164.2490997314453
1105/28840	Well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again I am commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you who were the very soul of our	98.00711059570312
1106/28840	Aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the	268.7419128417969
1107/28840	To meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easy	65.70013427734375
1108/28840	Ah dear DArtagnan see how regularly I live and how easy I am	49.07239532470703
1109/28840	We have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well	54.32244110107422

1113/28840	How can you know that You who never interest yourself in politics   Ah without caring about them myself I live among those who are much occupied in	98.08505249023438
1114/28840	I have no doubt of it said DArtagn	9.11384391784668
1115/28840	Now my dear friend look upon all I tell you as merely the statement of a monkof a man who resembles an echorepeating simply what he	153.94125366210938
1116/28840	I will not contradict you there said DArtagn	19.99226951599121
1117/28840	I must confess that I was	26.75301170349121
1118/28840	Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius as I thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio and he got on by	28.79970359802246
1119/28840	He is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in	58.30838394165039
1120/28840	He will amass wealth he will injure the kings revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to	165.1974639892578
1121/28840	He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantal	110.8456802368164
1122/28840	Do you know him I do	22.20452880859375
1123/28840	Hem said DArtagnan there is some truth in what you	31.586565017700195
1124/28840	Ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which I am endowed I am approved by a man like you fresh from the	87.95079803466797
1125/28840	But you speak of him not of his party his	162.76190185546875

1130/28840	He was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but	44.755088806152344
1131/28840	You see my poor friend that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to Maz	86.67717742919922
1132/28840	I cried DArtagnan not in the	16.372608184814453

1136/28840	Heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a	109.53825378417969
1137/28840	You are right DArtagnan I held a similar project but as I had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to	75.36074829101562
1138/28840	Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak	42.82443618774414
1139/28840	Monsieur de Gondy the cardinals enemy   No the kings friend said Aramis the kings friend you	30.043699264526367
1140/28840	Well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans	74.36984252929688
1141/28840	He is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the kings enemies are preparing for the poor	112.45323944091797
1142/28840	Ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear Aram	34.65343475341797
1143/28840	Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarins	34.25143814086914
1144/28840	But his heart will be in the army commanded by the Duc de Beau	31.620546340942383

1149/28840	Oh oh said Aramis there are questions between them at this very	46.6103401184082
1150/28840	And besides if it is not the prince then Monsieur de Gondy   But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for	25.68981170654297
1151/28840	And are there no cardinals that can fight Come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant and Monsieur de G	78.93756103515625
1152/28840	But a humpbacked general   Under the cuirass the hump will not be	53.214599609375
1153/28840	Besides remember that Alexander was lame and Hannibal had but one	320.85565185546875
1154/28840	Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked DArtagn	70.31565856933594
1155/28840	I foresee in it the aid of powerful	248.59056091308594
1156/28840	That may be done if they can separate the king from his	66.86743927001953
1157/28840	You Aramis know Anne of Austria better than I	54.75609588623047
1158/28840	Perhaps you are right said Aramis thoughtfully therefore I shall not pledge	46.460811614990234
1159/28840	To them or to us do you mean Aramis   To no	41.906982421875
1160/28840	What have I to do with politics I am not obliged to read any brev	44.04470443725586
1161/28840	I have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend I shall not meddle in	89.6966323852539
1162/28840	Well listen my dear Aramis said DArtagnan your philosophy convinces me on my	21.77481460571289
1163/28840	I dont know what devil of an insect stung me and made me	131.8324432373047
1164/28840	I have a post by which I live at the death of Monsieur de Tréville who is old I may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless Gas	27.779712677001953
1165/28840	Instead of running after adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos I shall go and shoot on his	94.99995422363281
1166/28840	You know he has estatesPorthos   I should think so	43.05547332763672
1167/28840	Ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon   Good said DArtagnan to	78.82475280761719
1168/28840	Then aloud   And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon   To which he adds that of Bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my tro	38.167293548583984
1169/28840	So that Porthos will be a bar	19.067102432250977
1170/28840	The Baroness Porthos will sound particularly	291.2955322265625
1171/28840	And the two friends began to	72.73733520507812
1172/28840	So DArtagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of Mazarins   Nor you of the Prince de Condé   No let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frond	38.87498474121094
1173/28840	And DArtagnan poured out a glass of	17.526729583740234
1174/28840	At all events if you want me remember the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chev	22.91356086730957
1175/28840	And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits from six in the morning to eight at night come by the	70.7830581665039
1176/28840	From eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the	108.13182830810547
1177/28840	Oh I cant let you go so I will go with	54.9144401550293
1178/28840	And he took his sword and	89.82260131835938
1179/28840	He wants to be sure that I go away said DArtagnan to	23.99974250793457
1180/28840	Aramis whistled for Bazin but Bazin was asleep in the antechamber and Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake	32.6343879699707
1181/28840	Bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep	48.55315399169922
1182/28840	Come come sleepy head quick the ladder   But said Bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the	119.21949768066406
1183/28840	Didnt you see that Monsieur dArtagnan mounted with difficulty It will be even more difficult to	38.86500549316406
1184/28840	DArtagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced	32.402462005615234
1185/28840	Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the	68.00933837890625
1186/28840	Presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the	204.65562438964844
1187/28840	Now then said DArtagnan this is something like this is a means of	39.683467864990234
1188/28840	A woman could go up a ladder like	258.6648864746094
1189/28840	Aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but DArtagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable	49.808860778808594
1190/28840	Besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his	33.63263702392578
1191/28840	In a moment he was on the	27.408475875854492
1192/28840	Stay there said Aramis I shall return	46.30336380004883
1193/28840	The two friends went toward the	168.279296875
1194/28840	At their approach Planchet came out leading the two	101.82791900634766
1195/28840	That is good to see said Aram	38.177879333496094
1196/28840	There is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow Bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the	96.15357208251953
1197/28840	Follow us Planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the	40.09285354614258
1198/28840	They traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses   Go then dear friend said Aramis follow your own	79.47162628173828
1199/28840	Fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your	217.4699249267578
1200/28840	As for me I remain in my humility and indol	58.511173248291016
1201/28840	What I hate today I adore tomorrow and vice	226.64927673339844
1202/28840	You see that I cannot like you for instance settle on any fixed	256.8699035644531
1203/28840	Thou liest subtile one said DArtagnan to	88.43331909179688
1204/28840	Thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealth	228.13441467285156
1205/28840	They descended into the plain by the	159.89918518066406
1206/28840	Planchet met them hard by the	153.03057861328125
1207/28840	DArtagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook	67.85980987548828
1208/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to	15.113362312316895
1209/28840	But after he had gone about two hundred steps DArtagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddlebow to fasten them to his gird	23.60408592224121
1210/28840	This is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his du	182.13352966308594
1211/28840	Stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for	123.96771240234375
1212/28840	Having thus spoken DArtagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the	78.30062866210938
1213/28840	He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent of the Jesuits an open space surrounded by a	37.508934020996094
1214/28840	The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his	76.92501831054688
1215/28840	In truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low	107.42865753173828
1216/28840	Close to the hedge the steps	223.90011596679688
1217/28840	DArtagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the	14.365175247192383
1218/28840	Two men to the astonishment of DArtagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a caval	66.49748229980469
1219/28840	Calm yourself dear Rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen	288.8067321777344
1220/28840	I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an	55.17987060546875
1221/28840	Oh answered another voice which DArtagnan instantly recognized as that of Aram	34.027435302734375
1222/28840	Be prudent sensible   I always obey madame when I am commanded by so gentle a	98.48782348632812
1223/28840	Ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft	38.85154342651367
1224/28840	Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat   Aramis rushed after the fugitive	69.86400604248047
1225/28840	DArtagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed caval	56.40328598022461
1226/28840	At that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like DArtagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light DArtagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the Duchess de Longue	40.37028121948242
1227/28840	Aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the	65.72840118408203
1228/28840	Good said DArtagnan rising and brushing his knees now I have theethou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longue	47.78892517089844
1229/28840	Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierref	11.852663040161133
1230/28840	It was then in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that	57.492820739746094
1231/28840	At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiriesthe host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to	61.1004524230957
1232/28840	The next morning DArtagnan summoned the host one of those sly Normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct	97.78827667236328
1233/28840	DArtagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his	54.49309539794922
1234/28840	At nine in the morning he reached Nanteuil and stopped for	99.6732406616211
1235/28840	His host here was a good fellow from Picardy who gave him all the information he	81.84343719482422
1236/28840	The Bracieux estate was a few leagues from VillarsCottere	15.025181770324707
1237/28840	DArtagnan was acquainted with VillarsCotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time VillarsCotterets was a royal	25.36627769470215
1238/28840	He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin d	98.9285659790039
1239/28840	There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that Porthos was not at Bracie	24.485578536987305
1240/28840	He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds and resided on his new	25.39916229248047
1241/28840	The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed	97.97006225585938
1242/28840	It is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after	62.2932243347168
1243/28840	There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry	72.09259033203125
1244/28840	Accordingly DArtagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for	52.110130310058594
1245/28840	It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by DArtagn	53.30517578125
1246/28840	It was nearly eight oclock when they set out	41.48420333862305
1247/28840	Their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the	50.72410202026367
1248/28840	The morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gau	102.9347915649414
1249/28840	In other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep	70.5578842163086
1250/28840	There came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the	168.00694274902344
1251/28840	As to Planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a huntinghound in his old masters	90.46766662597656
1252/28840	At the extremity of the wood DArtagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal	23.24808120727539
1253/28840	Oh oh he said I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of	80.42586517333984

1256/28840	As he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye DArtagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and	68.09477996826172
1257/28840	One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hat	75.142333984375
1258/28840	and surmounted by four stately gilded weatherc	198.7059783935547
1259/28840	DArtagnan no longer doubted that this was Porthoss pleasant dwelling	37.2613525390625
1260/28840	The road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc dEnghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles	75.5898208618164
1261/28840	DArtagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by Planchet at the same	35.03786849975586

1263/28840	In the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall	67.81684875488281
1264/28840	On his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses	56.31809616088867
1265/28840	A considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their	194.16323852539062
1266/28840	Monsieur Porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely	85.47920989990234
1267/28840	Nevertheless said DArtagnan the people are bowing very low to this	51.24756622314453

1269/28840	As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this	89.779052734375
1270/28840	Hey yes thank God I am pretty well said Mousqu	50.51720428466797

1277/28840	Ah there theres something promising said DArtagn	44.59850311279297
1278/28840	No mysteries no cloak to hide ones self in no cunning policy here people laugh outright they weep for joy	367.8352966308594
1279/28840	I see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala	123.75468444824219
1280/28840	As for me said Planchet I seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our	125.08831787109375
1281/28840	Ah sir what a cook must Monsieur Pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called Monsieur Porthos   Say no more cried DArtagn	41.409732818603516

1283/28840	DArtagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chate	13.059840202331543
1284/28840	He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the	46.05173110961914
1285/28840	Independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave	123.1192398071289
1286/28840	He ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semicircle at a respectful distance looked on with humble	44.09476089477539

1356/28840	It is I who cherish no	128.80809020996094
1357/28840	Porthos didnt understand any too clearly but then we know that understanding was not his strong	244.86514282226562
1358/28840	You say then he continued that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal   Yes and the queen	29.103778839111328
1359/28840	The queen do you say   To inspire us with confidence she has even placed in Mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat I once sold to Monsieur des Essarts and of which I dont know how she has regained	64.31108856201172
1360/28840	But it seems to me said Porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to	22.114301681518555
1361/28840	So I think replied DArtagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to	105.50558471679688
1362/28840	Yes we are devoted to them repeated Porthos and youto whom are you devoted now   To the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover I have answered for your devotion	56.3446044921875

1400/28840	I have your word then   Yes tis	40.029090881347656
1401/28840	I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin but   But   But he must make me a bar	55.83084487915039
1402/28840	Zounds said DArtagnan thats settled already I will be responsible for the bar	87.69271087646484
1403/28840	On this promise being given Porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the	102.71821594238281
1404/28840	As they returned toward the castle DArtagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has	50.4822883605957
1405/28840	Whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie	365.0293273925781
1406/28840	When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton	44.797096252441406
1407/28840	The face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute fel	128.3811798095703
1408/28840	Here is what I am looking for thought DArtagnan but alas the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which I am	32.18393325805664
1409/28840	He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to	24.671350479125977
1410/28840	Sir said the servant I have a favour to ask	31.39638328552246
1411/28840	Perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me   Art thou happy friend asked DArtagn	43.87333297729492
1412/28840	As happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than I	83.65689849853516
1413/28840	Well speak if it depends on	90.59687042236328
1414/28840	Oh sir it depends on you	152.89804077148438
1415/28840	Sir the favor I have to ask of you is not to call me Mousqueton but M	50.8619270324707
1416/28840	Since I have had the honor of being my lords steward I have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect	50.06734848022461
1417/28840	You sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of	113.48902893066406
1418/28840	DArtagnan smiled Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names Mousqueton to cut his	55.002811431884766
1419/28840	Well my dear Mouston he said rest	174.49835205078125
1420/28840	I will call thee Mouston and if it makes thee happy I will not tutoyer you any	57.19070816040039
1421/28840	Oh cried Mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor I shall be grateful all my life it is too much to	49.084590911865234
1422/28840	Alas thought DArtagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed	44.04161834716797
1423/28840	Will monsieur remain long with us asked Mousqueton with a serene and glowing count	40.36717987060547
1424/28840	I go tomorrow my friend replied DArtagn	20.971237182617188
1425/28840	Ah monsieur said Mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our	28.966136932373047
1426/28840	I fear that is true said DArtagnan in a low	9.926570892333984
1427/28840	What time is it then   Eh why it is after one o	50.20146560668945
1428/28840	Your home is a paradise Porthos one takes no note of	177.01925659179688
1429/28840	I follow you though I am not	57.32646179199219
1430/28840	Come if one cant always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor Athos the truth of which I have discovered since I began to be	93.31964874267578
1431/28840	DArtagnan who as a Gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of Athoss maxim but he did his best to keep up with his	47.681907653808594
1432/28840	He could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of	421.9426574707031
1433/28840	But he said Mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active	74.18326568603516
1434/28840	That may be true replied Porthos but I am used to him and besides he wouldnt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so	38.59420394897461
1435/28840	And you asked Porthos havent you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligentwhat then is his name   Planchetyes I have found him again but he is lackey no	83.799072265625
1436/28840	Ah he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards How does it happen then that he is in your service   He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be	24.76788330078125
1437/28840	And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchets	60.18998718261719
1438/28840	Well said Porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when Planchet would rescue Rochefort and that you would protect him in it   I should not have believed him but men are changed by	50.99296188354492
1439/28840	There is nothing truer than that said Porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is	81.5602798461914
1440/28840	Taste of this it is a Spanish wine which our friend Athos thought much	145.55911254882812
1441/28840	At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been	78.36114501953125
1442/28840	Tell me Mouston said Porthos are my arms in good condition   Your arms my lordwhat arms   Zounds my	89.8091049194336
1443/28840	What weapons   My military	208.15274047851562
1444/28840	Yes my lord at any rate I think	34.65419387817383
1445/28840	Make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished	107.38538360595703
1446/28840	Which is my best cavalry horse  	183.88818359375
1447/28840	And the best hack   Bay	135.27386474609375
1448/28840	What horse dost thou choose for thyself   I like Rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit	71.63481140136719

1450/28840	Polish up or make some one else polish my	203.437744140625
1451/28840	Then take pistols with thee and a hunting	291.4469909667969
1452/28840	Are we then going to travel my lord asked Mousqueton rather	67.02672576904297
1453/28840	An expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into l	140.6649169921875
1454/28840	We are going to return to the service Mouston replied Porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long	40.07291793823242
1455/28840	Into the servicethe kings service Mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at DArtagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost	47.07928466796875
1456/28840	We shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to our former	151.3711700439453
1457/28840	These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunder	53.93225860595703
1458/28840	It was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the	134.81044006347656
1459/28840	The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the	87.54485321044922
1460/28840	Oh said DArtagnan we dont now make war as we did	44.237396240234375
1461/28840	Today its a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask Planc	179.28611755371094
1462/28840	Mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of DArtagn	42.67356491088867
1463/28840	But he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being	200.496337890625
1464/28840	The deuce they do said Mousqueton I think I should like the siege of Rochelle better than this war then   Porthos meantime asked DArtagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his	32.308162689208984
1465/28840	Four days replied his friend are necessary to reach Blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to	101.90714263916016
1466/28840	Set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the Hotel de la Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and there await	36.05244064331055
1467/28840	As to myself I shall go around to see Athos for though I dont think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said DArtagn	101.89460754394531
1468/28840	The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of Pierrefonds to which Porthos escorted his	33.63981246948242
1469/28840	At least DArtagnan said to himself as he took the road to VillarsCotterets at least I shall not be alone in my	21.740692138671875
1470/28840	That devil Porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if Athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis that little coxcomb with his too good	65.9792709350586
1471/28840	At VillarsCotterets he wrote to the cardinal   My LordI have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty	36.95576477050781
1472/28840	I am just setting out for Bl	55.170841217041016
1473/28840	The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne in the environs of that	11.450748443603516
1474/28840	He had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his	45.45989227294922
1475/28840	It was many years since DArtagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated	90.87385559082031
1476/28840	Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound	149.860595703125
1477/28840	Without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that DArtagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of Bl	50.68169403076172
1478/28840	Going along DArtagnan shaking his head said   I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd but still I owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of	61.608482360839844
1479/28840	Oh Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman said Planchet was he not Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles	58.11119842529297
1480/28840	I was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying Oh Tis a noble gentlemanMonsieur Ath	138.14682006835938
1481/28840	Yes true as Gospel said DArtagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine	64.27531433105469
1482/28840	I remember well said Planchet he was fond of drinkingin truth he drank but not as other men	114.72008514404297
1483/28840	One seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say Come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrow	87.1224136352539
1484/28840	And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle There was no one like him for	71.05552673339844
1485/28840	And now replied DArtagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits	77.37818145751953
1486/28840	God knows Planchet that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de la Fere whom we loved so	40.50299072265625
1487/28840	Planchet shook his head and said	25.9049072265625
1488/28840	It was evident that he shared his masters apprehens	76.98585510253906
1489/28840	Probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that I have heard described at Chamb	120.08924865722656
1490/28840	A man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the	60.46807861328125
1491/28840	Whats your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de lUnivers	53.58529281616211
1492/28840	We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagn	8.82155990600586
1493/28840	The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered	104.41517639160156
1494/28840	Gentlemen he said the wood that I am carting is his I cut it in his copse and I am taking it to the chate	113.83992004394531
1495/28840	DArtagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to Planc	29.93283462524414
1496/28840	He had a heavy handdear old Athosafter	337.3039245605469
1497/28840	DArtagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a	83.8942642211914
1498/28840	He checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep	37.09623336791992
1499/28840	On beholding this house DArtagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of	76.49872589111328
1500/28840	He proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the	83.98361206054688
1501/28840	Through the gate was seen kitchengardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the	73.45912170410156
1502/28840	This cannot be the establishment of Ath	49.20980453491211
1503/28840	Good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his	102.31121826171875
1504/28840	Alight Planchet and inquire for I confess that I have scarcely courage so to	89.16686248779297
1505/28840	Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here asked Planc	11.591889381408691
1506/28840	Yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to Planchet who was not in l	35.60546112060547
1507/28840	A nobleman retired from service is he not  	76.0463638305664
1508/28840	And who had a lackey named Grimaud persisted Planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much	51.20162582397461
1509/28840	Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine Planchet from head to	75.20462799072266
1510/28840	Then cried Planchet joyously I see well that it is the same Comte de la Fere whom we	25.755727767944336
1511/28840	Be good enough to open to me for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet	37.541080474853516
1512/28840	Why didnt you say so said the servitor opening the	88.63447570800781
1513/28840	But where is your master   He is following	44.6978874206543
1514/28840	The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet who made a sign to DArtagn	28.247846603393555
1515/28840	The latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismount	73.88432312011719
1516/28840	He vaulted hastily from his horse whilst Planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the	35.61244583129883
1517/28840	But I know you my lad said Athos appearing on the	49.893863677978516
1518/28840	Oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and I know	14.028826713562012
1519/28840	I am PlanchetPlanchet whom you know	26.341102600097656
1520/28840	But the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected	95.9145278930664
1521/28840	What Planchet is Monsieur dArtagnan here   Here I am my friend dear Athos cried DArtagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from	15.327043533325195
1522/28840	At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of Ath	89.75139617919922
1523/28840	He rushed toward DArtagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his	23.42176055908203
1524/28840	DArtagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his	79.45450592041016
1525/28840	Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawingroom where there were several	50.450748443603516
1526/28840	I present to you he said Monsieur le Chevalier DArtagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that I have ever	21.861562728881836
1527/28840	DArtagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at Ath	37.935150146484375
1528/28840	Strange Athos was scarcely aged at all His fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than	107.39981842041016
1529/28840	His face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish	196.03378295898438
1530/28840	His hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by Titian and Vandy	139.84152221679688
1531/28840	Meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment   Ah tis Raoul who is come	53.93294143676758
1532/28840	Athos as the name of Raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at DArtagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his	31.57889175415039
1533/28840	But DArtagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet	61.09986877441406
1534/28840	Nevertheless DArtagnan was struck by the appearance of this new person	31.13913345336914
1535/28840	It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated	100.63126373291016
1536/28840	Here you are home again Raoul said the com	112.7525863647461
1537/28840	Yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and I have performed the commission that you gave	60.66200637817383
1538/28840	But whats the matter Raoul said Athos very anx	47.846858978271484
1539/28840	Sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little	22.033931732177734
1540/28840	To Mademoiselle de la Valliere asked Athos	15.979326248168945
1541/28840	What is it cried many persons	288.18011474609375
1542/28840	She was walking with her nurse Marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback I	122.06346893310547
1543/28840	She saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise	57.653968811035156
1544/28840	I fear that she has badly sprained her	64.01974487304688
1545/28840	And her mother Madame de SaintRemy have they yet told her of it   No sir Madame de SaintRemy is at Blois with the Duchess of	36.3390998840332
1546/28840	I am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than	125.97835540771484
1547/28840	I am come sir to ask your	49.72173309326172
1548/28840	Send directly to Blois Raoul or rather take horse and ride immediately	216.16754150390625

1550/28840	I have brought her here sir and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well	218.63485717773438
1551/28840	The guests now all took leave of Athos excepting the old Duc de Barbe who as an old friend of the family of La Valliere went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his	59.79670333862305
1552/28840	She will be the sooner with her	145.9870147705078
1553/28840	As for you Raoul I am sure it is your fault some giddiness or	52.83295822143555
1554/28840	No sir I assure you muttered Raoul it is	35.66839599609375
1555/28840	Oh no no I declare it is not cried the young girl while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her	56.689178466796875
1556/28840	Nevertheless Raoul you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de SaintR	33.67527770996094
1557/28840	Whilst this scene was going on DArtagnan remained with open mouth and a confused	95.36690521240234
1558/28840	Everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with	58.33913803100586
1559/28840	Athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the	54.41444778442383
1560/28840	Whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared	153.4571075439453
1561/28840	True monsieur le comte replied DArtagnan who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over	23.97459602355957
1562/28840	First and foremost dear DArtagnan we have no title such as count	72.2854232788086
1563/28840	When I call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you	53.8553581237793
1564/28840	But to you DArtagnan I am I hope still dear Athos your comrade your	46.40669631958008
1565/28840	Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were   Oh God forbid   Then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each	39.9693717956543
1566/28840	You are surprised at what you see here   Extreme	27.5308895111084
1567/28840	But above all things I am a marvel to you   I confess	47.08017349243164
1568/28840	I am still young am I not Should you not have known me again in spite of my eightandforty years of age   On the contrary I do not find you the same person at	39.40964126586914
1569/28840	I understand cried Athos with a gentle	76.9353256225586
1570/28840	Everything DArtagnan even folly has its	83.86903381347656
1571/28840	Then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own I presume You have a park and horses	386.0520324707031
1572/28840	Yes I inherited this little property when I quitted the army as I told	47.11531066894531
1573/28840	The park is twenty acrestwenty comprising kitchengardens and a	78.33323669433594
1574/28840	I have two horsesI do not count my servants bobtailed n	57.648170471191406
1575/28840	My sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two set	144.81051635742188
1576/28840	But then all this extravagance is not for myself added Athos	43.56364822387695
1577/28840	Yes I see for the young man Raoul said DArtagn	18.726926803588867
1578/28840	You guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country	105.6103286743164
1579/28840	It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see I was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to	121.40178680419922
1580/28840	This child has caused me to recover what I had	85.44615936279297
1581/28840	I had no longer any wish to live for myself I have lived for	34.56214141845703
1582/28840	I have corrected the vices that I had I have assumed the virtues that I had	51.91508102416992
1583/28840	I may be mistaken but I believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could	76.72320556640625
1584/28840	The remembrance of Milady recurred to DArtagn	18.83601188659668
1585/28840	And you are happy he said to his	66.62370300292969
1586/28840	As happy as it is allowed to one of Gods creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think DArtagnan for you have not yet done	54.25926208496094
1587/28840	You are too bad Athos one can hide nothing from you answered DArtagn	42.98876953125
1588/28840	I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling   Remorse I finish your	57.30038833618164
1589/28840	I do not feel remorse because that woman I profoundly hold deserved her	141.9158172607422
1590/28840	Had she one redeeming trait I doubt	172.62417602539062
1591/28840	I do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of	132.3050079345703
1592/28840	But I do not mean my friend that we were right in what we	42.59172821044922
1593/28840	Hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish	247.24313354492188
1594/28840	I have sometimes thought as you do Ath	95.93177032470703
1595/28840	She had a son that unhappy woman  	78.49476623535156
1596/28840	Have you ever heard of him  	66.68352508544922
1597/28840	He must be about twentythree years of age said Athos in a low	12.65878677368164
1598/28840	I often think of that young man DArtagn	19.510969161987305
1599/28840	Strange for I had forgotten him said the	46.66792678833008
1600/28840	And Lord de Winterdo you know anything about him   I know that he is in high favor with Charles	31.63998794555664
1601/28840	The fortunes of that monarch now are at low	503.9220886230469
1602/28840	He shed the blood of Strafford that confirms what I said just nowblood will have	102.42681121826172
1603/28840	And the queen   What queen   Madame Henrietta of England daughter of Henry	56.01991653442383
1604/28840	She is at the Louvre as you	45.51250076293945
1605/28840	Yes and I hear in bitter	212.6355438232422
1606/28840	Her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in	180.68960571289062
1607/28840	Do you grasp that said Athos shrugging his shoulders the daughter of Henry	21.576766967773438
1608/28840	shivering for want of a fagot Why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from Mazarin She should have wanted	133.94989013671875
1609/28840	Have you ever seen the queen of England inquired DArtagn	35.762752532958984
1610/28840	No but my mother as a child saw	135.52781677246094
1611/28840	Did I ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici  	64.54032135009766
1612/28840	You know Athos you never spoke much of such	176.0907440185547
1613/28840	Ah mon Dieu yes you are right Athos replied but then there must be some occasion for	47.56189727783203
1614/28840	Porthos wouldnt have waited for it so patiently said DArtagnan with a	20.633285522460938
1615/28840	Every one according to his nature my dear DArtagn	36.46329116821289
1616/28840	Porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent	99.81525421142578
1617/28840	I sometimes wonder replied Athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound	98.61582946777344
1618/28840	Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts DArtagn	381.1485290527344
1619/28840	Believe me it is only the evilminded who deny friendship they cannot understand	261.9851379394531
1620/28840	And Aramis   I have seen him also said DArtagnan but he seemed to me	23.248470306396484
1621/28840	Ah you have seen Aramis said Athos turning on DArtagnan a searching	22.376834869384766
1622/28840	Why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the Temple of Friendship as the poets would	48.43306350708008
1623/28840	Aramis you know continued Athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with	72.6537857055664
1624/28840	I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said DArtagn	17.629796981811523
1625/28840	Athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of	187.263427734375
1626/28840	You see said he calling DArtagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my	40.41664123535156
1627/28840	All is charming and everything savors of nobility replied DArtagn	59.433326721191406
1628/28840	At this instant they heard the sound of horses	88.5511703491211
1629/28840	Tis Raoul who has come back said Athos and we can now hear how the poor child	42.30769348144531
1630/28840	In fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and DArtagn	27.135498046875
1631/28840	Monsieur said Athos placing his hand on DArtagnans shoulder monsieur is the Chevalier DArtagnan of whom you have often heard me speak Ra	18.66911506652832
1632/28840	Monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous	38.29167175292969
1633/28840	That little compliment could not fail to move DArtagn	52.29304504394531
1634/28840	But he will make it up in you I am	48.97041320800781
1635/28840	I like your manner Raoul and your politeness has touched	69.78795623779297
1636/28840	Athos was more delighted than can be	199.13406372070312
1637/28840	He looked at DArtagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive	30.26973533630371
1638/28840	Now said DArtagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance I am sure of	36.18056869506836
1639/28840	I hope the accident has been of no consequence   They dont yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been	81.58840942382812
1640/28840	At this moment a little boy half peasant half footboy came to announce	257.4737243652344
1641/28840	Athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hothouse full of magnificent	101.47989654541016
1642/28840	The plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the	223.0321044921875
1643/28840	DArtagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of	31.292953491210938
1644/28840	Yes a chef doeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini replied Ath	40.06767272949219
1645/28840	What battle does it represent   That of Marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to Francis	84.09701538085938
1646/28840	It was on that occasion that my ancestor Enguerrand de la Fere was made a knight of the Order of	34.18239974975586
1647/28840	Michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of work	100.8397445678711
1648/28840	Men were giants in those times said Athos now we are pigmies in	111.03199768066406
1649/28840	Call Charles he added addressing the boy who	179.2191925048828
1650/28840	My good Charles I particularly recommend to your care Planchet the laquais of Monsieur DArtagn	76.1595458984375
1651/28840	He likes good wine now you have the key of the	111.3072738647461
1652/28840	He has slept a long time on a hard bed so he wont object to a soft one take every care of him I beg of	124.08534240722656
1653/28840	You think of everything said DArtagnan and I thank you for Planchet my dear Ath	14.449420928955078
1654/28840	Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus	90.9347152709961
1655/28840	My friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when I hear	96.64250183105469
1656/28840	Tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to	196.9961395263672
1657/28840	What do you mean sir inquired Ra	20.904996871948242
1658/28840	He was eighteen only three years older than you are Raoul when I saw him set to work pitted against tried	108.69525146484375
1659/28840	And did Monsieur DArtagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening	32.26007080078125
1660/28840	I killed one man if I recollect rightly replied DArtagnan with a look of inquiry directed to Athos another I disarmed or wounded I dont remember	60.02375411987305
1661/28840	Wounded said Athos it was a phenomenon of	83.41603088378906
1662/28840	The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need rep	95.0169448852539
1663/28840	DArtagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but Athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by Ra	32.815921783447266
1664/28840	DArtagnan retired to bednot to sleep but to think over all he had heard that	55.13822937011719
1665/28840	Being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for Athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunk	130.36085510253906
1666/28840	He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his	166.46034240722656
1667/28840	Nevertheless it seemed to him that Athos was not in all respects sincere and	65.59076690673828
1668/28840	It was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that Athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenants	58.97367858886719
1669/28840	He could not help thinking of	45.38090133666992
1670/28840	The clear and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would	152.35179138183594
1671/28840	He would enter into the ministers schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by	91.69107055664062
1672/28840	Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day DArtagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after	55.963768005371094
1673/28840	He determined to cultivate the goodwill of the youth Raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the	133.46876525878906
1674/28840	But DArtagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of Ath	70.05070495605469
1675/28840	Besides to tell truth whilst DArtagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos truehearted open Ath	65.15516662597656
1676/28840	It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that Athos on the contrary would despise	49.137725830078125
1677/28840	Ah why is not Grimaud the taciturn Grimaud here thought DArtagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence   There reigned a perfect stillness in the	84.99295043945312
1678/28840	DArtagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn	48.86244201660156
1679/28840	At last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen	90.25546264648438
1680/28840	Not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber aboveas he supposed the bedroom of Ath	93.692626953125
1681/28840	He is walking about and thinking thought DArtagnan but of what It is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not	58.613651275634766
1682/28840	At length Athos went to bed apparently for the noise	111.67936706542969
1683/28840	Silence and fatigue together overcame DArtagnan and sleep overtook him	90.50696563720703
1684/28840	He was not however a good	98.13314056396484
1685/28840	Scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the	103.42802429199219
1686/28840	Somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealth	209.17987060546875
1687/28840	True to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know DArtagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of Ra	62.53184509277344
1688/28840	The young man was opening the door of the	65.67921447753906
1689/28840	The road as DArtagnan had observed was the way to Bl	48.35832977294922
1690/28840	So thought the Gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who doesnt at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair	109.47820281982422
1691/28840	Hes not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms hes not going on a message for he goes	165.34523010253906
1692/28840	Why does he go in secret Is he afraid of me or of his father for I am sure the count is his	80.14818572998047
1693/28840	By Jove I shall know about that soon for I shall soon speak out to Ath	76.7004165649414
1694/28840	Day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the	65.21717834472656

1696/28840	The latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the	303.73193359375
1697/28840	The Gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went	68.84780883789062
1698/28840	Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the	38.4278678894043
1699/28840	Goodday to you have you slept well   Excellently Athos but what are you looking for You are perhaps a tulip fancier   My dear friend if I am you must not laugh at me for being	60.403438568115234

1701/28840	I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this	83.5014419555664
1702/28840	These gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water theyve allowed him to walk over the	133.8731231689453
1703/28840	Ah you think so do you   And he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were	57.594207763671875

1714/28840	You do not make Raoul work so he takes his own way of employing	123.97628784179688
1715/28840	Exactly therefore I think of sending him away from	99.03919219970703

1742/28840	Athos was for a few moments	136.54661560058594
1743/28840	Good DArtagnan is for Mazarin he said to	30.03659439086914

1760/28840	The other was in a feminine hand long and	282.5025939941406
1761/28840	Come said DArtagnan to Raoul seeing that Athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse	38.06871795654297
1762/28840	And they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing	115.24983978271484
1763/28840	In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles brought in a letter for DArtagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly	42.72173309326172
1764/28840	It was now Athoss turn to take a sly	151.98094177246094

1766/28840	Faith you are indeed right not to return to	118.11564636230469

1768/28840	Egad yes but why dont you come there also   Athos colored a little and answered   Should I go I shall be delighted to see you	60.53907775878906

1770/28840	Then turning to Athos he added   I seem to miss something	48.6954345703125

1776/28840	Raoul turned toward Athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to	40.3406867980957

1778/28840	Adieu then to both my good friends said DArtagnan may God preserve you as we used to say when we said goodbye to each other in the late cardinals	43.38532638549805
1779/28840	Athos waved his hand Raoul bowed and DArtagnan and Planchet set	24.238574981689453
1780/28840	The count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said   Raoul we set out tonight for	38.484127044677734
1781/28840	Eh cried the young man turning	25.961477279663086
1782/28840	You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de SaintR	28.899433135986328
1783/28840	I shall wait for you here till	105.17221069335938
1784/28840	The young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his	54.00260543823242
1785/28840	As to DArtagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again   Return immediately to	42.677879333496094
1786/28840	The epistle is laconic said DArtagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably I should not have understood it but happily there is a post	33.20098114013672
1787/28840	And he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the	150.02288818359375
1788/28840	Go to the kings treasurer at Blois tell him your name and show him this letter you will receive two hundred pist	48.573486328125
1789/28840	Assuredly said DArtagnan I admire this piece of	57.828914642333984
1790/28840	The cardinal writes better than I	187.071533203125
1791/28840	Come Planchet let us pay a visit to the kings treasurer and then set	25.392986297607422
1792/28840	Toward Paris sir   Toward	270.86077880859375
1793/28840	And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could	312.4627990722656
1794/28840	There was a dispute among the	136.4765167236328
1795/28840	I tell you one of them was saying that if Coysel predicted that tis as good as true I know nothing about it but I have heard say that hes not only an astrologer but a	46.2510871887207
1796/28840	Deuce take it friend if hes one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying	170.0064697265625
1797/28840	Why   Because he may be tried for	38.5953483581543
1798/28840	Ah absurd they dont burn sorcerers	270.4467468261719
1799/28840	No Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier	74.28630828857422
1800/28840	My friend Urban Grandier wasnt a sorcerer he was a learned	227.82676696777344
1801/28840	He didnt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous	127.06944274902344
1802/28840	Mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same	147.16729736328125
1803/28840	I dont say resumed the guard that Coysel is not a sorcerer but I say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming	144.54190063476562
1804/28840	How so   Why in this way if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not	69.29774475097656
1805/28840	He was an Italian and therefore superst	72.73784637451172
1806/28840	He walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were	39.24824905395508
1807/28840	What were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that Monsieur de Beaufort had escaped were you not   Oh no my lord said the incredulous	29.788185119628906

1810/28840	My lord said the guard I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsunt	117.78779602050781
1811/28840	Coysel is a madman returned the	130.24566650390625

1815/28840	It has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous Mazarin was superst	69.8492202758789
1816/28840	He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should	46.73405456542969
1817/28840	The guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest	157.31436157226562
1818/28840	During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his	44.13027572631836
1819/28840	It was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry	65.25344848632812
1820/28840	especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of	63.973026275634766
1821/28840	But like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his	95.11880493164062
1822/28840	Often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of Monsieur de Beau	27.046358108520508

1825/28840	His air of perfect serenity made Mazarin	264.41363525390625
1826/28840	Do you know what they are saying here   No your em	24.97324562072754
1827/28840	Well they say that Monsieur de Beaufort is going to escape from Vincennes if he has not done so	20.066606521606445
1828/28840	Escape my lordescape Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is   Yes I do sir in the donjon of Vinc	29.728029251098633
1829/28840	Yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my	186.0281219482422
1830/28840	Sir replied Mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watchspring one may saw through an iron	105.87545776367188

1833/28840	No no cried Mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his	83.84683990478516
1834/28840	He then asked with whom he	222.60415649414062
1835/28840	My lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with	132.38710021972656
1836/28840	But does he not approach the walls while playing   Your eminence doesnt know those walls they are sixty feet high and I doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping	62.232418060302734
1837/28840	Hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more	156.48817443847656

1839/28840	Take care you assert a great deal said Maz	114.93647003173828
1840/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of	48.809696197509766
1841/28840	My lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long	223.18138122558594
1842/28840	Come come not such a fool as I fancied thought Maz	108.05564880371094
1843/28840	Besides my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes continued La Ramee and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beau	11.288629531860352
1844/28840	Yes but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes	12.456948280334473

1865/28840	During the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man	93.30648040771484
1866/28840	de Beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made	241.23020935058594
1867/28840	But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the	70.84812927246094
1868/28840	After having failed in poetry Monsieur de Beaufort tried	78.48719787597656
1869/28840	He drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb Maz	53.99842071533203
1870/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny the governor of Vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath	43.79062271118164
1871/28840	The next day the prisoners room was full of pictures and mott	110.25958251953125
1872/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of	98.81465911865234
1873/28840	de Beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat	67.130615234375
1874/28840	The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawingpaper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarins	40.03758239746094
1875/28840	The governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that	82.55235290527344
1876/28840	To this Monsieur de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a Bayard he would become a Raphael or a Michael	55.788692474365234
1877/28840	Nevertheless one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly	105.05182647705078
1878/28840	His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keep	206.20046997070312
1879/28840	With this animal which he called Pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its	186.56341552734375
1880/28840	At last when Pistache was sufficiently well trained Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his	46.75075912475586
1881/28840	The party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the	55.4646110534668
1882/28840	Having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over	101.25961303710938
1883/28840	The intelligent creature was received with loud	291.8299560546875
1884/28840	Nothing could be better done a sundial could not have shown the hour with greater	125.81380462646484
1885/28840	Then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in	81.50958251953125
1886/28840	Then the duke put to Pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world   Pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and	67.75460052490234
1887/28840	de Beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what I ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his	317.4664611816406
1888/28840	Is not the greatest thief in the world Monsieur the kings secretary Le Camus who came to Paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions   The dog shook his	38.71436309814453
1889/28840	Then said the prisoner lets think who it can	176.38522338867188
1890/28840	Can it be can it possibly be the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina hey   Pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times success	64.19145202636719
1891/28840	Gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the Illustrious Coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to Pist	46.88399124145508
1892/28840	Let us go on to another of his	148.4944305419922
1893/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny be so good as to lend me your	25.703861236572266
1894/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beau	12.72962474822998
1895/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one	46.519248962402344
1896/28840	Now Pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for Madame de Montb	86.62003326416016
1897/28840	But interposed Monsieur de Chavigny it seems to me that Pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de P	26.164844512939453
1898/28840	Stop said the duke Pistache jump for the	57.589813232421875
1899/28840	And he raised his cane six inches	146.21189880371094
1900/28840	The dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over	119.6264877319336
1901/28840	And now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the	65.51868438720703
1902/28840	The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the	160.7132568359375
1903/28840	Now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground Pistache my friend jump for the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Pisc	51.43303680419922
1904/28840	The dog turned his back to the	114.51376342773438
1905/28840	What asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pist	39.961517333984375
1906/28840	But Pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the	61.77733612060547
1907/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time Pistaches patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his	48.677677154541016
1908/28840	Three days afterward Pistache was found deadpoison	140.45741271972656
1909/28840	Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned	77.64103698730469
1910/28840	This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him	79.90850067138672
1911/28840	So it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as t	78.97543334960938
1912/28840	Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent Pist	98.97687530517578
1913/28840	De Chavigny who according to report was a son of Richelieus and had been a creature of the late cardinals understood	42.17365646362305
1914/28840	He took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at Vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting	38.83180236816406
1915/28840	A fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future	97.69869232177734
1916/28840	One morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial	44.862754821777344
1917/28840	Now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beau	45.56391906738281
1918/28840	He assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows   Gentlemen will you permit a grandson of Henry	72.30376434326172
1919/28840	to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy   Odds fish as my grandfather used to say I once reigned in Paris do you know that I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my	56.585174560546875
1920/28840	The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the	80.76813507080078
1921/28840	Gentlemen and citizens set me free I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Maz	119.28693389892578
1922/28840	I will make you all captains with good pensions Odds fish On march forward   But eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of Henry	65.71800231933594
1923/28840	did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so Monsieur de Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the	71.99605560302734
1924/28840	Sometimes when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians all fully armed appear at Vincennes to deliver him from	38.05716323852539
1925/28840	My lord answered De Chavigny with a low bow I have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand	83.12478637695312
1926/28840	I should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexpl	125.00031280517578
1927/28840	Yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken I should be obliged to let them hang youat which I should be most unhappy	103.03010559082031
1928/28840	And in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavign	14.451701164245605
1929/28840	And once more he bowed low before his high	151.66810607910156
1930/28840	These bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus   Monsieur de Chavigny turning toward the door used to call out Halloo La Ramee   La Ramee came into the	31.420045852661133
1931/28840	La Ramee I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an	70.44866180419922
1932/28840	La Ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper the shadow of his person but La Rameegay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the dukes eyeshis incorrupt	150.15780639648438
1933/28840	Now although La Ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry	54.416404724121094
1934/28840	hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his	78.58367156982422
1935/28840	One may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and	68.44158935546875
1936/28840	La Ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the mo	36.6121940612793
1937/28840	Twas too brief an enjoyment and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of	62.25969314575195
1938/28840	But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second	129.80966186523438
1939/28840	Grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of Vinc	66.61929321289062
1940/28840	He addressed about twelve words to him Grimaud answered in	423.4547424316406
1941/28840	Heres a promising fellow and it is I who have found out his merits said Monsieur de Chavign	31.425235748291016
1942/28840	Go he added and make yourself agreeable to Monsieur la Ramee and tell him that you suit me in all	35.766212463378906
1943/28840	Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a	266.273681640625
1944/28840	So after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply La Ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged Grim	84.86312103271484
1945/28840	They are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keep	199.57797241210938
1946/28840	Good answered Grimaud and he went right to the	70.95953369140625
1947/28840	The duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach Mazarin with his wretched appearance and	48.758056640625
1948/28840	The comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing	230.25360107421875
1949/28840	As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the teatable he took it up and as he took it he made a low	45.60002136230469
1950/28840	The duke looked at this strange figure with	71.66880798339844
1951/28840	The figure put the comb in its	312.1131591796875
1952/28840	Ho hey whats that cried the d	90.51301574707031
1953/28840	Who is this creature   Grimaud did not answer but bowed a second	55.074432373046875
1954/28840	Grimaud made a sign that he was	46.85551834106445

1956/28840	A keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallows	82.54412841796875
1957/28840	Halloo La Ramee some one   La Ramee ran in haste to obey the	44.45052719116211
1958/28840	Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the d	51.98360061645508

1960/28840	Why does he take my comb   Why do you take my lords comb asked La Rame	31.43958854675293
1961/28840	Grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word Point	104.18635559082031
1962/28840	What does the animal say asked the d	62.23075485229492
1963/28840	That the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed	151.3686981201172
1964/28840	Are you mad La Ramee You yourself gave me this	79.56072998046875
1965/28840	I was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you I acted in opposition to my	82.3662109375
1966/28840	I perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he	107.21018981933594
1967/28840	A fresh practical joke now occurred to the d	144.99009704589844
1968/28840	The day was employed in preparations for the	188.3321075439453
1969/28840	Every one grows childish in prison but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was particularly disposed to become	42.20204162597656
1970/28840	In the course of his mornings walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted	107.07669830322266
1971/28840	When he came home he formed his handkerchief into a	131.005126953125
1972/28840	Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud but La Ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his	50.79398727416992
1973/28840	The guards looked on it with	238.07418823242188
1974/28840	Who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frown	76.59884643554688
1975/28840	Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done	48.54689407348633
1976/28840	What thou again Why didst thou take it   Yeswhy asked La Rame	54.63851547241211
1977/28840	Grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said	112.1932144165039
1978/28840	I will shape it out for you with my	79.34671020507812
1979/28840	And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as	73.74635314941406
1980/28840	Thats it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst I go and fetch the	59.997657775878906
1981/28840	La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a	39.09909439086914
1982/28840	Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with	49.849266052246094
1983/28840	La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus Grimaud however did not even	117.59574890136719
1984/28840	He approached La Ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread   Cardinal he	42.21183395385742

1986/28840	La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the	29.21536636352539
1987/28840	He was going to throw the crawfish out also when Grimaud snatched it from his	68.09075927734375
1988/28840	Good to eat he said and put it in his	71.15150451660156
1989/28840	This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his	83.38998413085938
1990/28840	But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even	49.662559509277344
1991/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate	40.06975555419922
1992/28840	The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the more and more odious to	95.43573760986328
1993/28840	One morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when Grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the	51.99311447143555
1994/28840	You are insupportable cried the duke I shall beat	44.31346893310547

1996/28840	Spy cried the duke more and more enraged I will strangle you with my own	40.052852630615234
1997/28840	And he extended his hands toward Grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind	73.85618591308594
1998/28840	At the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone   Hush smiling as he uttered the	47.581947326660156
1999/28840	A gesture a smile and a word from Grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short ast	92.40443420410156
2000/28840	Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a	69.77713775634766

2013/28840	Here is what you are looking for he	33.68178939819336
2014/28840	The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimauds hands but Grimaud shook his	73.13003540039062
2015/28840	Thank you monseigneur he said drawing back I am	52.60226821899414
2016/28840	The duke went from one surprise to	187.93801879882812
2017/28840	Grimaud drew near and kissed it	214.86131286621094
2018/28840	The grand manner of Athos had left its mark on Grim	99.51016235351562
2019/28840	What shall we do and when and how proceed   It is now eleven answered Grim	92.318115234375
2020/28840	Let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramp	53.45069122314453
2021/28840	And then   Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back	48.826759338378906
2022/28840	Grimaud made a sign that he was going	52.385963439941406
2023/28840	Ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me   I wish my lord would make me one	34.69390869140625
2024/28840	True on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost	58.52313995361328
2025/28840	Now resumed Grimaud Ive only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest	58.0582389831543
2026/28840	At this moment La Ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the	63.163055419921875
2027/28840	The duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his	63.475730895996094
2028/28840	La Ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward	42.74406814575195
2029/28840	Then turning to Grimaud   Very good my friend very	39.39423370361328
2030/28840	You have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon I hope have news that will be agreeable to	62.71476745605469
2031/28840	Grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his	135.40185546875
2032/28840	Well my lord said La Ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow   So tis you La Ramee in faith tis time you came back	53.054237365722656
2033/28840	I threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that I mightnt break my promise and strangle Grim	63.91031265258789
2034/28840	I doubt however said La Ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your high	41.073387145996094
2035/28840	Pardieu you are righta mute from the East I swear it was time for you to come back La Ramee and I was eager to see you	33.17612075805664
2036/28840	Monseigneur is too good said La Ramee flattered by the	27.94856071472168
2037/28840	Yes continued the duke really I feel bored today beyond the power of	81.17105865478516
2038/28840	Then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed La Rame	43.498390197753906
2039/28840	I am at your service my	13.901158332824707
2040/28840	I protest my dear La Ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that I would stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure of your	21.60948371887207
2041/28840	My lord replied La Ramee I think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be	46.88902282714844
2042/28840	What do you mean Have you seen him lately   He sent for me	30.353567123413086
2043/28840	Really to speak to you about me   Of what else do you imagine he would speak to me Really my lord you are his	43.100006103515625
2044/28840	Ah La Ramee if you would but accept my offers I would make your	46.08699035644531
2045/28840	How you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be	183.10000610351562
2046/28840	I shall no sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of	68.28385162353516
2047/28840	Pshaw pshaw I cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king I see my lord I shall be obliged to fetch a second Grimaud   Very well let us say no more about	45.71992111206055
2048/28840	Monseigneur I see well that I must call Grim	51.53093719482422
2049/28840	And what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me   I admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre	80.27482604980469
2050/28840	What did he say to me He told me to watch	50.59270477294922
2051/28840	And why so why watch me asked the duke uneas	75.897216796875
2052/28840	Because an astrologer had predicted that you would	88.96707916259766
2053/28840	Ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of	36.39862823486328
2054/28840	Oh mon Dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest	109.83853149414062
2055/28840	And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence   That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not to buy	81.63370513916016
2056/28840	Why not   Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a	67.38179016113281
2057/28840	Let us go and have a game at tennis La Rame	30.60310935974121
2058/28840	My lordI beg your highnesss pardonbut I must beg for half an hours leave of	91.95272827148438
2059/28840	Why   Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to	42.18216323852539
2060/28840	I bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor Monsieur de Chavigny though Ive been here a week has not ordered so much as a tart	61.666412353515625
2061/28840	But I then replied probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not	39.404632568359375
2062/28840	My pastry not good Well Monsieur La Ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at	54.76063919067383
2063/28840	I cannot I replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chate	25.27918815612793
2064/28840	Very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an	56.74848937988281
2065/28840	In half an hour Yes have you breakfasted Faith	125.66337585449219
2066/28840	Well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old Burg	37.29193115234375
2067/28840	So you see my lord since I am hungry I would with your highnesss leave And La Ramee bent	47.87611770629883
2068/28840	Go then animal said the duke but remember I only allow you half an	73.47313690185547
2069/28840	May I promise your custom to the successor of Father Marteau my lord   Yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of Vincennes are fatal to my	54.78364944458008
2070/28840	La Ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a	46.98892593383789
2071/28840	But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from Madame de Montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew	40.492733001708984
2072/28840	But his confidence in Grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his	103.9970474243164
2073/28840	Pâtés made by the Successor of Father Marteau are	71.21426391601562
2074/28840	In half an hour La Ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts	61.41451644897461
2075/28840	The pates were excellent the wine	590.3935546875
2076/28840	The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open	171.92807006835938
2077/28840	The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of	28.4049072265625
2078/28840	The peasant the gardener was Rochefort whom he believed to be in the Bast	82.25968170166016
2079/28840	Well Whos up there said the	274.12664794921875
2080/28840	Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the d	89.4294204711914
2081/28840	The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by La Ramee and the	54.88533020019531
2082/28840	One however fell at the dukes feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his	39.15577697753906
2083/28840	La Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the	49.437164306640625
2084/28840	The duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books	128.39686584472656
2085/28840	La Ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not	41.896461486816406
2086/28840	Ask day after tomorrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than Noirmont your former maitre dhot	60.06157684326172
2087/28840	Do not open the pie till you are	200.33253479003906
2088/28840	I hope you will be satisfied with its	32.093162536621094
2089/28840	Your highnesss most devoted servant   In the Bastile as elsewhere   Comte de Roche	26.566713333129883
2090/28840	The duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his	121.71456909179688
2091/28840	La Ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive	70.44234466552734
2092/28840	He endeavored to cheer him up in his	73.54257202148438
2093/28840	Ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if I could but do as you do and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father Marteaus	46.25193786621094
2094/28840	Tis true my lord answered La Ramee that his pates are famous and his wine	90.4415283203125
2095/28840	In any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur de Chavign	30.643278121948242
2096/28840	Well my lord said La Ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them Besides I have promised him your	81.82657623291016
2097/28840	If I am to remain here permanently as Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand I must provide myself with a diversion for my old age I must turn gour	42.54920959472656
2098/28840	My lord said La Ramee if you will take a bit of good advice dont put that off till you are	83.3278579711914
2099/28840	Good said the Duc de Beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that Master La Ramees is glutton	65.93851470947266
2100/28840	Let us then take advantage of	56.58439254760742
2101/28840	Then aloud   Well my dear La Ramee the day after tomorrow is a	20.248823165893555
2102/28840	Will you give me a lesson the day after tomorrow   In what   In gastronomy   Willingly my	26.755565643310547
2103/28840	Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny well have a supper here under your	49.832115173339844
2104/28840	The proposal was seductive but La Ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to	51.98698043823242
2105/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of	33.38005065917969
2106/28840	Did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem He reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the	134.5402069091797
2107/28840	As to getting him drunk the duke couldnt hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of	110.5723876953125
2108/28840	Then an idea came to him which harmonized	161.28343200683594
2109/28840	The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his	76.99422454833984
2110/28840	But presently the exempts face suddenly bright	560.4398803710938
2111/28840	Well he asked that will do will it not   Yes my lord on one	67.84356689453125
2112/28840	What   That Grimaud shall wait on us at	79.94649505615234
2113/28840	Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim   To the devil with your Grimaud He will spoil the	106.35032653808594
2114/28840	I will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesnt speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles	130.8436279296875
2115/28840	Do you know my friend I find one thing very evident in all this you distrust	79.3495864868164
2116/28840	My lord the day after tomorrow is Pentec	48.131568908691406
2117/28840	Well what is Pentecost to me Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison   No my lord but I have already told you what that damned magician	34.88856887817383
2118/28840	And what was it   That the day of Pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of Vinc	34.18379211425781
2119/28840	You believe in sorcerers then you fool   II mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my Lord Giulio who cares about them as an Italian he is superst	83.77366638183594
2120/28840	Well then with well acted goodhumor I allow Grimaud but no one else you must manage it	87.15345764160156
2121/28840	Order whatever you like for supperthe only thing I specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his piesnot only now but when I leave my	89.30166625976562
2122/28840	Then you think you will some day leave it said La Rame	52.80604553222656
2123/28840	The devil replied the prince surely at the death of Maz	68.68785095214844
2124/28840	I am fifteen years younger than he	25.771347045898438
2125/28840	At Vincennes tis true one lives faster   My lord replied La Ramee my lord   Or dies sooner for it comes to the same	40.44359588623047
2126/28840	He stopped however at the door for an	78.96401977539062
2127/28840	Whom does your highness wish me to send to you   Any one except Grim	49.318790435791016
2128/28840	The officer of the guard then with his chessboard  	58.63216018676758
2129/28840	Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of	43.9824104309082
2130/28840	A strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a	146.77392578125
2131/28840	The duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the fortyeight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his	97.98823547363281
2132/28840	Besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected They had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious p	103.21720886230469
2133/28840	And what friends awaited him without He had friends then after five years in prison If that were so he was indeed a highly favored	194.97792053222656
2134/28840	He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered	172.97116088867188
2135/28840	It is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was	54.9013786315918
2136/28840	So the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy	108.291259765625
2137/28840	But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one waythey killed time for him till eight oclock in the evening then would come night and with night	124.81603240966797
2138/28840	So at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him	59.63737869262695
2139/28840	The duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like	207.09213256835938
2140/28840	He dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly	140.96278381347656
2141/28840	For a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed	195.81590270996094
2142/28840	His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really	93.43234252929688
2143/28840	He fell asleep again and another vision	185.9729461669922
2144/28840	He was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave Vinc	20.542461395263672
2145/28840	Grimaud was walking before him with a	176.6091766357422
2146/28840	By degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his	153.6158905029297
2147/28840	At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to	129.94789123535156
2148/28840	The sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against	255.59420776367188
2149/28840	He made fruitless efforts to go on it was	100.44721984863281
2150/28840	Nevertheless he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front	162.15396118164062
2151/28840	He wished to call out to him but could not utter a	37.740596771240234
2152/28840	Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing	39.33129119873047
2153/28840	He was discovered all hope of flight was	352.9897155761719
2154/28840	Still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his	84.38655853271484
2155/28840	At last he heard the voice of La Rame	23.028501510620117
2156/28840	La Ramee took his hand and laughed	46.18195724487305
2157/28840	He was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which Ornano Puylaurens and his uncle had	91.05533599853516
2158/28840	Their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly	127.31095123291016
2159/28840	The duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was	43.60841751098633
2160/28840	In fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for	70.60389709472656
2161/28840	What is the matter with your highness asked La Rame	12.580081939697266
2162/28840	Tis your fault you simpleton answered the d	95.59500122070312
2163/28840	With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing	105.22764587402344
2164/28840	Come he said tis a warning from	78.04053497314453
2165/28840	Never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your	89.16674041748047

2325/28840	And that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came   It was I the Comte de la Fere said Athos rising and bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevre	31.3404483795166
2326/28840	The duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter   Ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad Marie Michon fared better than she	58.25868606567383
2327/28840	Sit down dear count and go on with your	160.67112731933594
2328/28840	At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault mad	98.41097259521484
2329/28840	I have told you that I was traveling on an important	42.326297760009766
2330/28840	At daybreak I left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion	427.107177734375
2331/28840	In the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her	111.32420349121094
2332/28840	Her pretty face arrested my attention I approached and recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with	250.91746520996094
2333/28840	In that way I discovered that the charming traveler was   Marie Michon said Madame de Chevreuse	32.38718795776367
2334/28840	Then I went out of the house I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey	58.53067398071289
2335/28840	And have you never revisited that village eagerly asked Madame de Chevre	58.62078094482422
2336/28840	Well   I wanted to see the good curé	49.74356460571289
2337/28840	I found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all	67.78982543945312
2338/28840	A week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 October 16	88.5811538696289
2339/28840	It was the date of that strange adventure interrupted Madame de Chevre	43.997947692871094
2340/28840	Yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his	54.4509391784668
2341/28840	You must know monsieur that Marie Michon when she returned to France in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near	55.199790954589844
2342/28840	And what said the abbé asked Ath	22.76976203918457
2343/28840	That a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it	61.58994674682617
2344/28840	Ah I see That nobleman was you it was his father   Hush do not speak so loud madame he is	50.797515869140625
2345/28840	He is there my son the son of Marie Michon But I must see him	54.2647705078125
2346/28840	Take care madame said Athos for he knows neither his father nor his	74.8339614868164
2347/28840	You have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me	63.364776611328125
2348/28840	Oh thanks sir thanks cried Madame de Chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips you have a noble	35.769012451171875
2349/28840	Tomorrow I plunge into an adventurous affair in which I may be	75.89588165283203
2350/28840	Then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a	100.66548919677734
2351/28840	Rest assured cried the duchess I shall do what I	30.380889892578125
2352/28840	I have but little influence now but all that I have shall most assuredly be	106.76075744628906
2353/28840	As to his title and fortune   As to that madame I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicom	34.99789047241211
2354/28840	Upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman But I am eager to see our young vicom	21.927934646606445
2355/28840	Where is he   There in the	39.68204879760742
2356/28840	I will have him come in if you really wish	57.76166915893555
2357/28840	Athos moved toward the door the duchess held him	42.6077880859375
2358/28840	So he opened the door and beckoned the young man	17.686004638671875
2359/28840	The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to	46.30445861816406
2360/28840	Vicomte come here said Athos the duchess permits you to kiss her	44.95296096801758
2361/28840	The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevre	47.84454345703125
2362/28840	If I were I should do for you at once the most that you	78.75483703613281
2363/28840	But let us see whatever I may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to	114.6383285522461
2364/28840	Athos standing looked at them both with indescribable	51.57951354980469
2365/28840	Madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the	44.13225173950195
2366/28840	I have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention I believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the	34.985713958740234
2367/28840	Personally I am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between Madame de Montbazon my motherinlaw and Madame de Longue	20.0020751953125
2368/28840	But the Prince de Marsillac Yes indeed thats the right	56.620506286621094
2369/28840	The Prince de Marsillacmy old friendwill recommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes	45.718841552734375
2370/28840	You know Bragelonne said Athos I never speak without	30.737384796142578
2371/28840	Well comte I am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the Prince de Marsillac who is happily in Paris just	38.2867431640625
2372/28840	What are you going to do this evening   We intend to visit the Abbé Scarron for whom I have a letter of introduction and at whose house I expect to meet some of my	29.27960968017578
2373/28840	Tis well I will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess do not quit his salon until you have seen	38.81985092163086
2374/28840	There was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of Paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich	64.07967376708984
2375/28840	There was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that	232.71250915527344
2376/28840	Nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went	73.24153900146484
2377/28840	It was the abode of the little Abbé Scar	24.19643211364746
2378/28840	The diminutive Abbé Scarron who however was an abbé only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans which he	71.64249420166016
2379/28840	On a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and	102.7474136352539
2380/28840	He had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to	91.21452331542969
2381/28840	He then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange	79.0943374633789
2382/28840	At first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the	94.78678894042969
2383/28840	As soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides Scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy	121.82970428466797
2384/28840	Scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself	105.4395523071289
2385/28840	Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his	102.42328643798828
2386/28840	He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to Paris where the fame of his wit had preceded	71.76730346679688
2387/28840	There he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting Anne of Austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a	59.23830032348633
2388/28840	Yes your majesty there is a title which I covet much replied Scar	93.71961975097656
2389/28840	And what is that   That of being your invalid answered Scar	49.827674865722656
2390/28840	So he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred franc	38.190185546875
2391/28840	From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life spending both income and	569.9266357421875
2392/28840	One day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so	46.85572052001953
2393/28840	And why asked Scarron is he not a man of good birth  	38.72964096069336
2394/28840	Witty   He has unfortunately too much	90.5986328125
2395/28840	Well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man   Because he is an	24.291793823242188
2396/28840	Of whom   Of the	52.178680419921875
2397/28840	What answered Scarron I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles Despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another	58.41404724121094
2398/28840	Impossible   The conversation had rested there and Scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more	56.65964126586914
2399/28840	It was on Thursday the abbés reception day people went there in	178.8727264404297
2400/28840	The cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehem	62.29405212402344
2401/28840	In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he	33.796199798583984
2402/28840	One of them hat in hand said to him   Would you believe it monsieur that contemptible Mazarin has stopped poor Scarrons	61.958858489990234
2403/28840	That is unreasonable said Athos saluting in his turn the two caval	34.43241500854492
2404/28840	It happens well that we are going there this evening said Athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor	40.62319564819336
2405/28840	Do gentlemen then make verses asked Raoul naively I thought it was	75.46842193603516
2406/28840	So it is my dear vicomte said Athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases famewitness Monsieur de Rot	37.945133209228516
2407/28840	Nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice I think it is better not to make	47.38547134399414
2408/28840	Then said Raoul this Monsieur Scarron is a poet   Yes you are warned vicom	26.978336334228516
2409/28840	Consider well what you do in that	95.95268249511719
2410/28840	Talk only by gestures or rather always	271.5185852050781
2411/28840	You will see me talking with one of my friends the Abbé dHerblay of whom you have often heard me	22.495763778686523
2412/28840	Come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not	54.215721130371094
2413/28840	That little stratagem may serve to keep off interl	154.56874084472656
2414/28840	Very well monsieur I will obey you at all	35.650184631347656
2415/28840	Athos made two visits in Paris at seven oclock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and foot	45.862613677978516
2416/28840	Athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young	86.16857147216797
2417/28840	This was the Abbé Scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand toying nervously with a small	94.09382629394531
2418/28840	Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and	311.531494140625
2419/28840	Large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent	75.20922088623047
2420/28840	Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the	113.40501403808594
2421/28840	On perceiving Athos Aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to Scar	34.012794494628906
2422/28840	Raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esp	75.85365295410156
2423/28840	After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle Pau	18.93998146057129
2424/28840	Athos touched the shoulder of the vicom	88.10408782958984
2425/28840	Look at this lady Raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her King Henry	106.64276123046875
2426/28840	Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet for she was always very much the	49.70100784301758
2427/28840	She was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens	82.97224426269531
2428/28840	This fawncolored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of La Lion	109.61668395996094
2429/28840	Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queenlike grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on Ra	72.42294311523438
2430/28840	Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her dont try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of Henry	65.38470458984375
2431/28840	When shall we two walk together Athos then said to Aram	97.5228500366211
2432/28840	Presentlythere are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be	194.43858337402344
2433/28840	At this moment the door opened and in walked the coadj	44.59394836425781
2434/28840	At this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated	184.28512573242188
2435/28840	He knew the Abbé de Gondy only by	33.290836334228516
2436/28840	He saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everythingexcept drawing a sword and firing a pistolwith something haughty and contemptuous in his	112.71162414550781
2437/28840	Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his	63.36196517944336
2438/28840	Well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé   This was the orthodox	39.79253387451172
2439/28840	It had been said that evening a hundred timesand Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved	83.61212158203125
2440/28840	Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he	23.690704345703125
2441/28840	But how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre	50.7091064453125
2442/28840	Oh no cried Scarron I should compromise you too	85.26837921142578
2443/28840	Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant   I shall borrow from the	53.00764465332031
2444/28840	But her majesty has no property interposed Aram	102.06694793701172
2445/28840	At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was	17.587421417236328
2446/28840	Scarron turned his chair toward the door Raoul blushed Athos made a sign to Aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a	41.102420806884766
2447/28840	Is he then so ill dear Voiture asked Aramis half hidden by the window	151.9029083251953

2452/28840	You are not called Lionne for nothing observed Madame de Chevreuse your teeth are	68.13489532470703
2453/28840	You are unjust to a great poet it seems to me Raoul ventured to	42.09482192993164
2454/28840	A great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen	101.0044174194336
2455/28840	A great poet he is scarcely five feet	284.5054931640625
2456/28840	Bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair Paulet it is high time to put little Voiture in his right	110.73152160644531
2457/28840	For my part I always thought his poetry detestable and I think I know something about	87.3109359741211
2458/28840	Raoul turned and saw two faces just	487.2539978027344
2459/28840	One was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden pet	187.99447631835938
2460/28840	The other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devote	181.35867309570312
2461/28840	Meantime Aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his	69.29021453857422
2462/28840	Aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could not refrain from a slight movement of	36.40781021118164
2463/28840	Laugh then said Monsieur de Retz they are looking at	32.007991790771484
2464/28840	And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse who was in the midst of a large	23.568256378173828
2465/28840	As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gestic	74.5819320678711
2466/28840	Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to	135.28573608398438
2467/28840	Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur labbé is repeating to	45.94918441772461

2469/28840	Raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round Madame de Chevre	60.968467712402344
2470/28840	Well then asked Athos in a low	16.629995346069336
2471/28840	It is to be tomorrow said Aramis	108.87296295166016

2475/28840	Aramis spoke so as to be heard by	81.84549713134766
2476/28840	And I too murmured the young lady with the velvet	64.87877655029297
2477/28840	I have the misfortune also to admire his poetry	197.96226501464844
2478/28840	Monsieur Scarron do me the honor said Raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the	53.39847946166992

2532/28840	At length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and	48.6706657409668
2533/28840	The sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which Raoul had neglected to close on the previous	64.49713134765625
2534/28840	He was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his	86.38138580322266
2535/28840	By degrees Athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so	89.29442596435547
2536/28840	His own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than	113.95158386230469

2540/28840	In recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that Raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young	64.93737030029297
2541/28840	You are there sir he said	118.65457153320312

2547/28840	Everything said Olivain to Athos has been done according to your directions the horses are	100.89432525634766
2548/28840	And I was asleep cried Raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these	76.14146423339844
2549/28840	Truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits   Therefore you love me a little I hope replied Athos in a tone of	52.354522705078125
2550/28840	Oh sir God knows how much I love revere	170.33633422851562
2551/28840	See that you forget nothing said Athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his	45.86444091796875
2552/28840	The servant then approached Athos and said hesitatingly   Monsieur le vicomte has no	29.667341232299805
2553/28840	Tis well said Athos I will take care of	20.77928924560547

2555/28840	When they reached the steps Raoul saw three	138.28305053710938
2556/28840	Oh sir then you are going with me   I will accompany you a portion of the way said Ath	23.775562286376953
2557/28840	Joy shone in Raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his	43.448429107666016
2558/28840	Athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their	94.45003509521484
2559/28840	Raoul delighted at the counts companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this by	246.08987426757812
2560/28840	They set out passing over the Pont Neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called LAbreuvoir Pepin and went along by the walls of the Grand Chate	42.722434997558594
2561/28840	They proceeded to the Rue Saint	36.816070556640625
2562/28840	After passing through the Porte Saint Denis Athos looked at Raouls way of riding and observed   Take care Raoul I have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a	36.547393798828125
2563/28840	See your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the	153.545654296875
2564/28840	You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre	132.1707000732422

2568/28840	The young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was	81.08116149902344
2569/28840	I have remarked also another thing said Athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far out	112.94339752197266
2570/28840	This tension lessens the accuracy of the	659.9607543945312
2571/28840	So in twelve times you thrice missed the	281.8240661621094
2572/28840	Which you sir struck twelve times answered Raoul	218.39073181152344
2573/28840	Because I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what I mean   Yes	60.357662200927734
2574/28840	I have fired since in that manner and have been quite	146.362548828125
2575/28840	What a cold wind resumed Athos a wintry	183.4503631591797

2578/28840	I shall do so if only in gratitude   Eh cried Athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder They	75.88006591796875
2579/28840	At all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to	101.72062683105469
2580/28840	We are judges of wounds we old soldiers Athos added	353.193603515625
2581/28840	Thank you sir answered the young man much	83.14520263671875

2636/28840	The only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableausuch is the instability of the human mindwas the sullen face of Grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his	95.28731536865234
2637/28840	It is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish	66.68489074707031
2638/28840	And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his	56.74345779418945
2639/28840	He had but one faulthe was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine	108.00840759277344
2640/28840	Now the successor of Pere Marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and Chambertin wine instead of Mac	44.872467041015625
2641/28840	He therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke	73.38217163085938
2642/28840	Since daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of Pere Marte	42.66832733154297
2643/28840	The latter had surpassed himself he showed La Ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with Monsieur de Beauforts coatof	37.98748779296875
2644/28840	It was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near	95.42327117919922
2645/28840	La Ramees mouth watered and he returned to the dukes chamber rubbing his	46.223209381103516
2646/28840	To crown his happiness Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputygovernor of the chate	27.74287223815918
2647/28840	As for Grimaud he seemed more sullen than	56.39752960205078
2648/28840	In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis with La Ramee a sign from Grimaud put him on the	23.901914596557617
2649/28840	Grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the	212.9582061767578
2650/28840	The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so	69.899658203125
2651/28840	There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different	159.25543212890625
2652/28840	When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle	109.44495391845703
2653/28840	It was evident that there the rope ladder was to be	96.2403564453125
2654/28840	This manoeuvre transparent to the Duc de Beaufort was quite unintelligible to La Rame	15.277217864990234
2655/28840	The game at tennis which upon a sign from Grimaud Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play began in the	51.315338134765625
2656/28840	The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee	70.24635314941406
2657/28840	Four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis	83.49124145507812
2658/28840	When the game was over the duke laughing at La Ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other	121.06436157226562
2659/28840	The guards asked permission of La Ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left	54.69273376464844
2660/28840	Six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served	62.44129180908203
2661/28840	Upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the	88.09930419921875
2662/28840	The rest of the dinner was to	108.08248901367188
2663/28840	Every one was impatient La Ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to	61.030540466308594
2664/28840	One might have fancied that Athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great	44.730682373046875
2665/28840	There were moments when looking at Grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for	97.70284271240234
2666/28840	The prince looked at Grimaud Grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarterpast	50.953861236572266
2667/28840	The escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to	43.258514404296875
2668/28840	La Ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his	57.90286636352539
2669/28840	It was Caesars Commentaries which La Ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey these inj	46.79508590698242
2670/28840	Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was	106.77557373046875
2671/28840	At halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely   Certainly Caesar was the greatest man of ancient	87.18688201904297
2672/28840	You think so my lord answered La Rame	16.093799591064453
2673/28840	Well as for me I prefer	133.78506469726562
2674/28840	And why pray Master La Ramee asked the d	35.929019927978516
2675/28840	Because he left no Commentaries replied La Ramee with his coarse	51.891963958740234
2676/28840	The duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that La Ramee should seat himself	43.104156494140625
2677/28840	There is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so La Ramee when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud presented a type of perfect	83.12890625
2678/28840	you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one	115.16726684570312
2679/28840	The duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of Grimaud who kept behind La Rame	26.81618881225586
2680/28840	My dear La Ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless	56.95927429199219
2681/28840	No my lord duke replied La Ramee in the fullness of his heart I say what I think there is no compliment in what I say to you   Then you are attached to me asked the d	21.27981185913086
2682/28840	To own the truth I should be inconsolable if you were to leave Vinc	81.9896011352539
2683/28840	A droll way of showing your aff	214.6639862060547
2684/28840	But my lord returned La Ramee what would you do if you got out Every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the Bastile instead of Vinc	67.34812927246094
2685/28840	Now Monsieur de Chavigny is not amiable I allow but Monsieur du Tremblay is considerably	17.81825065612793
2686/28840	Indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slown	61.08262634277344
2687/28840	Still by one of your forty methods your highness   Yes yes	43.14566421508789
2688/28840	My lord said La Ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your high	50.31499099731445
2689/28840	In ten minutes it would strike	198.82608032226562
2690/28840	Thank you La Ramee said the	25.062114715576172
2691/28840	Well my lord this famous invention of yours   Must I tell you replied the duke on what I most reckon and what I determine to try first   Yes thats the thing my lord cried his custodian g	63.9359130859375
2692/28840	Well I should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like	141.7432861328125
2693/28840	Well   Having then a keeper like La Ramee I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my	48.433746337890625
2694/28840	Come come said La Ramee thats not a bad	58.816524505615234
2695/28840	Capital isnt it for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to Mazarin as every gentleman ought to	93.32482147216797
2696/28840	Hush dont let us talk politics my	161.54966735839844
2697/28840	Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and I should have news from those without the prison	118.43643951416016
2698/28840	Ah yes but how can the news be brought to you   Nothing easier in a game of tennis for	68.07715606689453
2699/28840	In a game of tennis asked La Ramee giving more serious attention to the dukes	38.38983917236328
2700/28840	Yes see I send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a	53.33118438720703
2701/28840	Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a	97.85595703125
2702/28840	Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do	145.34652709960938
2703/28840	The devil it does The devil it does said La Ramee scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that my	48.70677947998047
2704/28840	I shall have to watch the men who pick up	134.296142578125
2705/28840	But resumed La Ramee that is only a way of	29.940950393676758
2706/28840	And that is a great deal it seems to	22.94377899169922
2707/28840	Pardon me for instance I say to my friends Be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two	41.179283142089844
2708/28840	Well what then La Ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch	65.94721984863281
2709/28840	I have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramp	46.79274368286133
2710/28840	Yes but answered La Ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes cant be sent around a ball like a	69.7735824584961
2711/28840	No but it may be sent in something	72.01538848876953
2712/28840	In something elsein something else In what   In a pate for	153.47305297851562
2713/28840	Let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre dhotel Noirmont has purchased the shop of Pere Marteau   Well said La Ramee shudder	29.830053329467773
2714/28840	Well La Ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall try	39.795326232910156
2715/28840	I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with	33.3377685546875
2716/28840	That we may be more at our ease La Ramee removes the guards keeping only Grimaud to wait on	64.52534484863281
2717/28840	Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in	243.8521270751953
2718/28840	The moment for my escape is fixedseven o	161.6547088623047
2719/28840	Well at a few minutes to seven   At a few minutes to seven cried La Ramee cold sweat upon his	34.65613555908203
2720/28840	At a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words I raise the crust of the pie I find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a	68.74886322021484
2721/28840	He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to La Ramees heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his	37.56449508666992
2722/28840	Meanwhile Grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the	66.071044921875
2723/28840	La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment	98.00950622558594
2724/28840	Oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you havent the heart to kill me   No not if thou dost not oppose my	34.05060577392578
2725/28840	But my lord if I allow you to escape I am a ruined	36.0502815246582
2726/28840	I will compensate thee for the loss of thy	112.83961486816406
2727/28840	You are determined to leave the chateau   By Heaven and earth This night I am determined to be	40.79863739013672
2728/28840	And if I defend myself or call or cry out   I will kill thee on the honor of a	68.15769958496094
2729/28840	Seven oclock said Grimaud who had not spoken a	44.600006103515625
2730/28840	La Ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his	58.0662727355957
2731/28840	The duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his	84.96064758300781
2732/28840	Why bind thee   That I may not be considered as your accompl	59.05494689941406
2733/28840	With your belt my lord replied La Rame	33.9539794921875
2734/28840	The duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud who tied La Ramee in such a way as to satisfy	38.318092346191406
2735/28840	La Ramee stretched out his legs Grimaud took a tablecloth tore it into strips and tied La Ramees feet	41.662864685058594
2736/28840	Now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangois	80.81439971923828
2737/28840	I ask for it without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I did not raise the	66.9569320678711
2738/28840	Thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it	348.9118347167969
2739/28840	Grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to	74.15497589111328
2740/28840	Now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that I have a wife and four	57.56169891357422
2741/28840	Rest assured put the gag in Grim	325.26611328125
2742/28840	In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid pro	35.30557632446289
2743/28840	Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a	92.40276336669922
2744/28840	At last they reached the tennis	105.68292999267578
2745/28840	No sentinels no one at any of the	51.94277572631836
2746/28840	The duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding	44.38515853881836
2747/28840	The duke exchanged a signal with	133.65646362304688
2748/28840	It was indeed for him that they were	73.3788833618164
2749/28840	Grimaud meantime undid the means of	490.3366394042969
2750/28840	This was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the	91.30412292480469
2751/28840	If I am caught I risk nothing but being taken back again to	102.75775146484375
2752/28840	If they catch thee thou wilt be	214.97567749023438
2753/28840	And instantly Grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous	123.27997589111328
2754/28840	The duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary	54.52621078491211
2755/28840	He had gone down about threequarters of the length of the wall when the cord	54.78832244873047
2756/28840	The duke uttered a cry but Grimaud did not give a single	32.25642395019531
2757/28840	He must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he	43.632598876953125
2758/28840	Immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under Grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew Grimaud to	83.68498992919922
2759/28840	Descend my lord said the man in the mo	56.18239974975586
2760/28840	There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is	208.0397186279297
2761/28840	The duke had already begun to	58.033660888671875
2762/28840	His task was the more difficult as there was no board to support	83.70198822021484
2763/28840	He was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty	62.54188919067383
2764/28840	But as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of	66.93289184570312
2765/28840	In less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the	23.076126098632812
2766/28840	He was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told	86.8851547241211
2767/28840	He let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any	150.4256134033203
2768/28840	He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met De Roche	45.87549591064453
2769/28840	The other two gentlemen were unknown to	84.33740234375
2770/28840	Grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a	186.5496368408203
2771/28840	Gentlemen said the duke I will thank you later now we have not a moment to	81.02693176269531
2772/28840	The timely Arrival of DArtagnan in	54.0734748840332
2773/28840	At Blois DArtagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any future service he might render the	61.363670349121094
2774/28840	From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but DArtagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint	54.41402053833008
2775/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos recognized	24.572887420654297
2776/28840	Thank God you have come   Eh goodday dear friend replied DArtagn	26.32930564880371
2777/28840	Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the	32.985591888427734
2778/28840	Ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses	148.4237060546875
2779/28840	Indeed said DArtagnan I am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine	26.97414779663086
2780/28840	The pretty Madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthoss words for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be	55.93138122558594
2781/28840	When will you do that   Immediately I	71.86883544921875
2782/28840	Ah so much the better   To that exclamation of Porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a	46.62766647338867
2783/28840	DArtagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of Mousqueton whose downdrawn mouth emitted sounds of	35.927677154541016
2784/28840	And you too my poor Monsieur Mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked DArtagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or	41.400672912597656
2785/28840	He finds the cooking detestable replied Porth	52.413700103759766
2786/28840	As for the cellar I have searched every part and poor stuff I	209.26995849609375
2787/28840	Monsieur Mouston said DArtagnan I should indeed condole with you had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend	41.213958740234375
2788/28840	Then taking Porthos aside   My dear Du Vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for I am going to take you to the card	37.09939956665039
2789/28840	Gracious me really exclaimed Porthos opening his great wondering	87.6553726196289
2790/28840	A presentation indeed   Does that alarm you   No but it agitates	73.7719955444336
2791/28840	Oh dont be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another	148.85931396484375

2805/28840	Ah said Mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit   Oh yes of course Mouston nothing	59.20751953125
2806/28840	But to avoid risk put the pistols in the hol	178.40711975097656
2807/28840	You will find mine on my saddle already	262.0136413574219
2808/28840	Mouston breathed a sigh he couldnt understand visits of ceremony made under	297.33502197265625
2809/28840	Indeed said Porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right DArtagnan Mouston will do Mouston has a very fine	26.277692794799805
2810/28840	But you my friendare you not going to change your dress   No I shall go as I	45.09355926513672
2811/28840	This traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his	288.0105895996094
2812/28840	They set out on Vulcan and Bayard followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to	35.664268493652344
2813/28840	Mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of Don Quixote was then the fashion they said that he was Sancho who after having lost one master had found	120.08621215820312
2814/28840	On reaching the palace DArtagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without	27.049833297729492
2815/28840	He was soon ordered to the presence of the	43.92314529418945
2816/28840	Courage he whispered to Porthos as they	47.3693962097168
2817/28840	Believe me the eye of the eagle is closed	257.50787353515625
2818/28840	We have only the vulture to deal	71.35492706298828
2819/28840	Hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of	103.27800750732422
2820/28840	Gervais and do not bow too low to this Italian that might give him a poor idea of	107.89752197265625
2821/28840	Good   Mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the	49.24605941772461
2822/28840	He saw DArtagnan and Porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his count	47.30131530761719
2823/28840	Ah you is it Monsieur le lieutenant you have been very	58.19843673706055
2824/28840	Here I am at your eminences service as well as Monsieur du Vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of Porth	32.11292266845703
2825/28840	Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of	36.63569259643555
2826/28840	The best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said DArtagn	22.95454978942871
2827/28840	Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times Frederick of Prussia used to	191.6854248046875
2828/28840	He admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of Porth	140.84103393554688
2829/28840	He seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and	99.71064758300781
2830/28840	He remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four	39.2314567565918
2831/28840	And your two other friends he	259.8677978515625
2832/28840	Porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn DArtagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his	32.20589828491211
2833/28840	They are prevented at this moment but will join us	244.08770751953125
2834/28840	And this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he	255.53814697265625
2835/28840	Yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for Monsieur de Bracieux is	26.732118606567383
2836/28840	Rich said Mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great	135.70394897460938
2837/28840	Fifty thousand francs a year said Porth	39.15477752685547
2838/28840	These were the first words he had	88.85440063476562
2839/28840	From pure zeal resumed Mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then   My lord has perhaps no faith in those words said DArtagn	62.966712951660156
2840/28840	Have you Monsieur le Gascon asked Mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his	33.4254035949707
2841/28840	I replied the Gascon I believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to	117.95027923583984
2842/28840	Now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a bar	63.897300720214844
2843/28840	Only that said Mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthoss devotion without opening his purse only that That can be	84.25897979736328
2844/28840	I shall be baron explained Porthos stepping	104.34017181396484
2845/28840	I told you so said DArtagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms	21.02985954284668
2846/28840	And you Monsieur DArtagnan what do you want   My lord said DArtagnan it is twenty years since Cardinal de Richelieu made me	13.25179386138916
2847/28840	Yes and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you	54.08802032470703
2848/28840	We will see gentlemen we will	119.73314666748047
2849/28840	Now Monsieur de Vallon said Mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country   Porthos opened his mouth to	25.283756256103516
2850/28840	My lord said DArtagnan Monsieur de Vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and	70.76277923583984
2851/28840	That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin he fell into	89.48094177246094
2852/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the	35.15410232543945
2853/28840	Well sir exclaimed Mazarin whats the matter and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded marketplace   My lord replied the messenger I wish to speak to your eminence in	35.82976531982422
2854/28840	I am Monsieur du Poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of Vinc	40.086097717285156
2855/28840	Mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that DArtagnan and Porthos should give	44.64146423339844
2856/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the	14.362685203552246
2857/28840	Speak monsieur speak at once said Mazarin What is the matter   The matter is my lord that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to escape from the Chateau of Vinc	16.0417537689209
2858/28840	Mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the	112.93902587890625
2859/28840	He fell back almost fainting in his	60.675777435302734
2860/28840	Escaped Monsieur de Beaufort escaped   My lord I saw him run off from the top of the terr	25.80093765258789
2861/28840	And you did not fire on him   He was out of	70.71693420410156
2862/28840	Monsieur de Chavignywhere was he  	27.942272186279297
2863/28840	And La Ramee   Was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near	45.07360076904297
2864/28840	But the man who was under him   Was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with	56.70123291015625
2865/28840	My lord said DArtagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious	26.177135467529297
2866/28840	It may still be possible to overtake the	116.45133209228516
2867/28840	France is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues	132.04087829589844
2868/28840	And who is to pursue him cried Maz	79.6001968383789
2869/28840	So would you said Mazarin looking with astonishment at those two	45.50810241699219
2870/28840	But the duke will not yield himself without a furious	69.72469329833984
2871/28840	Very well said DArtagnan his eyes aflame battle It is a long time since we have had a battle eh Porthos   Battle cried Porth	33.17329788208008
2872/28840	And you think you can catch him   Yes if we are better mounted than	48.21403503417969
2873/28840	Go then take what guards you find here and pursue	240.81451416015625
2874/28840	As for you my dear lieutenant I promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you	45.75138854980469
2875/28840	To horse Porthos said DArtagnan taking his friend by the	21.414501190185547
2876/28840	Here I am smiled Porthos with his sublime	162.06947326660156
2877/28840	They descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out To arms To arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the speed of the	79.70468139648438
2878/28840	Well baron I promise you some good exercise said the Gas	70.63433837890625
2879/28840	As they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers	159.94210815429688
2880/28840	At the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean DArtagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get	60.859893798828125
2881/28840	The troop continued its course as though their steeds had	185.09701538085938
2882/28840	Alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the	119.5228271484375
2883/28840	The musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and of the road to Vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a	25.51337242126465
2884/28840	The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furn	157.08460998535156
2885/28840	DArtagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most Mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective	44.687530517578125
2886/28840	From the top of an eminence DArtagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint	34.23615646362305
2887/28840	He rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the	114.99172973632812
2888/28840	In five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by	53.10942840576172
2889/28840	The several members of that group were much	259.4901123046875
2890/28840	They looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the	76.69197082519531
2891/28840	Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conject	171.24365234375
2892/28840	On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened	69.80779266357422
2893/28840	A few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his	61.28480529785156
2894/28840	My officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop	84.9327392578125
2895/28840	That prohibition is not for me said DArtagn	19.203277587890625
2896/28840	Have the fugitives been pursued   Yes my officer unfortunately they are well	162.82183837890625
2897/28840	How many are there   Four and a fifth whom they carried away	205.27066040039062
2898/28840	Do you hear baron They are only four   A joyous smile lighted Porthoss	93.8421859741211
2899/28840	How long a start have they   Two hours and a quarter my	215.363525390625
2900/28840	Two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not Porthos   Porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor	60.870540618896484
2901/28840	Very good said DArtagnan and now in what direction did they set out   That I am forbidden to	28.565927505493164
2902/28840	DArtagnan drew from his pocket a	10.277990341186523
2903/28840	And where is the governor   In the	39.70499801635742
2904/28840	Anger mounted to DArtagnans face he frowned and his cheeks were	79.86161041259766
2905/28840	Ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant I believe you are impudent to me Wait   He unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked	34.57645034790039
2906/28840	Order of the king I tell	39.416839599609375
2907/28840	Read and answer or I will blow out your brains   The sergeant saw that DArtagnan was in	37.421199798583984
2908/28840	And by what gate did they go out   By the Saint Maur	93.14044952392578
2909/28840	If you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged	62.43727111816406
2910/28840	And if you catch up with them you wont come back to hang me murmured the	95.65637969970703
2911/28840	DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and	16.387113571166992
2912/28840	This way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed	126.85567474365234
2913/28840	But now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double	42.967159271240234
2914/28840	It was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten	67.17528533935547
2915/28840	This last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell	146.2042999267578
2916/28840	DArtagnan who never turned his head did not perceive	17.245769500732422
2917/28840	Porthos told him of it in his calm	50.08475875854492
2918/28840	If only we two arrive said DArtagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are only four in	82.5403823852539
2919/28840	That is true said Porthos   And he spurred his courser	29.156068801879883
2920/28840	At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their	88.93548583984375
2921/28840	Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said Porth	111.82234191894531
2922/28840	Let us rather kill them yes kill them cried DArtagnan I see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this	67.81737518310547
2923/28840	In fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of	167.7706298828125
2924/28840	They set out after a run of two leagues Mousquetons horse	414.5865478515625
2925/28840	Gracious me said Porthos theres Phoebus	45.61009979248047
2926/28840	The cardinal will pay you a hundred pist	52.206302642822266
2927/28840	Let us set out again at full gall	38.364402770996094
2928/28840	But at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him	67.87618255615234
2929/28840	The devil exclaimed Porthos theres Vulcan found	128.56712341308594
2930/28840	Zounds cried DArtagnan then we must stop Give me your horse Porth	58.535057067871094
2931/28840	What the devil are you doing   By Jove I am falling or rather Bayard is falling answered Porth	31.08502960205078
2932/28840	What is it   I hear a	32.341270446777344
2933/28840	It belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking	53.506839752197266
2934/28840	No said DArtagnan it is in	14.037893295288086
2935/28840	That is another thing said Porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by DArtagn	26.52296257019043
2936/28840	Monsieur said Mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master Phoebus could no longer hold out and   Silence said Porth	32.92184066772461
2937/28840	In fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night	51.4456672668457
2938/28840	It is five hundred feet from here in advance said DArtagn	32.18529510498047
2939/28840	True monsieur said Mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting	28.99618148803711
2940/28840	Good said DArtagnan seizing his own now you understand Porthos   Not too	30.816661834716797
2941/28840	We are out on the kings	89.08467102050781
2942/28840	Well   For the kings service we need	102.87659454345703
2943/28840	Then not a word but set to work   They went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some	59.45126724243164
2944/28840	Yonder is the house Porthos said the Gascon let me do what I please and do you what I	48.06705093383789
2945/28840	They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine	96.4568862915039
2946/28840	A groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and brid	177.34732055664062
2947/28840	DArtagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps	39.27950668334961
2948/28840	I buy those horses he said to the	133.21914672851562
2949/28840	The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no	42.064632415771484
2950/28840	Didnt you hear fellow   Yes I	105.43588256835938
2951/28840	Why then didnt you reply   Because these horses are not to be sold was the	81.52937316894531
2952/28840	I take them then said the	58.104549407958984
2953/28840	And he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same	152.0799560546875

2955/28840	Half an hours rest is enough replied the Gas	136.3762664794922
2956/28840	A kind of steward appeared just as DArtagnan and his companions were prepared to	39.967987060546875
2957/28840	My dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word I will blow out your	67.83023834228516
2958/28840	But sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon   So much the better they must be good animals	23.471904754638672
2959/28840	And I mine Ive ten guards behind me dont you hear them gallop and Im one of the kings musket	121.3462905883789
2960/28840	They all mounted the horses as quickly as	226.9229736328125
2961/28840	Halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines   On on cried DArtagnan therell be firing on   They all set off swift as the	66.10208892822266

2963/28840	Take care of your horses cried DArtagnan to	28.245920181274414
2964/28840	A gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the	39.39966583251953
2965/28840	Ah I understand replied Porthos she has ordered relays of	50.455379486083984
2966/28840	And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left   My dear Porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said DArtagnan with a look as if he spoke against his	31.334726333618164
2967/28840	Pooh replied Porthos I am what I	26.194948196411133
2968/28840	They rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and	73.38822174072266
2969/28840	You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said Porth	39.68840789794922

2971/28840	Ah ah have we overtaken them   Good a dead horse said DArtagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as	73.8304443359375
2972/28840	I seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed Porthos leaning over his horses man	55.8016471862793
2973/28840	Saddled   Yes saddled and brid	60.12908935546875
2974/28840	Courage we have them   But if they are numerous observed Mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have	62.57431411743164
2975/28840	Nonsense cried DArtagnan theyll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as were in pursuit theyll be afraid and will	102.54639434814453
2976/28840	Ah do you see cried the	43.81740951538086
2977/28840	The lights again this time I too saw them said Porth	96.1396713256836
2978/28840	On on forward forward cried DArtagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five	63.53514099121094
2979/28840	The horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the	38.00739288330078
2980/28840	They rode on in this way for ten	115.99982452392578
2981/28840	Suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horse	139.3728790283203
2982/28840	Aha cried DArtagnan theyre coming toward	52.83847427368164
2983/28840	So much the worse for them said Porth	18.09197425842285
2984/28840	Who goes there cried a hoarse	64.90798950195312
2985/28840	The three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were	47.73335266113281
2986/28840	Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their	58.67475509643555
2987/28840	Who goes there was asked a second	150.59378051757812
2988/28840	Not a step forward or youre dead	266.7359924316406
2989/28840	Stuff cried Porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his	75.26902770996094
2990/28840	Stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our	135.83680725097656
2991/28840	Hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their	66.26486206054688
2992/28840	As for Porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from	58.25468826293945
2993/28840	Finish Mouston finish the work cried Porth	96.974365234375
2994/28840	And he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh	114.56576538085938
2995/28840	Ive broken my mans skull cried DArtagn	87.43709564208984
2996/28840	And you   Ive only thrown the fellow down but hark   Another shot of a carbine was	99.67471313476562
2997/28840	It was Mousqueton who was obeying his masters	54.442543029785156
2998/28840	On on cried DArtagnan all goes well we have the first	51.524681091308594
2999/28840	Ha ha answered Porthos behold other players	394.9997863769531
3000/28840	And in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the	123.73444366455078
3001/28840	This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to	99.69538879394531
3002/28840	Stand aside he cried stand off the road   What do you want asked a	65.62975311279297
3003/28840	The duke Porthos and DArtagnan roared out both at	26.949220657348633
3004/28840	A burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a gro	111.30048370361328
3005/28840	DArtagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had	49.36564636230469
3006/28840	At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and DArtagnan turned to	22.982872009277344
3007/28840	What would you have my dear fellow One doesnt hit the bullseye every time it is something to hit inside the	118.57041931152344
3008/28840	Ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse   Your horse is falling said Porthos reining in his	34.396949768066406
3009/28840	In truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to	43.49445724487305
3010/28840	He had received in the chest the bullet of DArtagnans first	45.71233367919922
3011/28840	DArtagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the	27.968517303466797
3012/28840	Does your honor want a horse asked Mousqu	148.92897033691406
3013/28840	Heres one your honor   How the devil hast thou two horses asked DArtagnan jumping on one of	47.29601287841797
3014/28840	Their masters are dead I thought they might be useful so I took	183.24264526367188
3015/28840	Be on the qui vive cried DArtagn	33.62543869018555
3016/28840	As he spoke two horsemen advanced at full	116.53388977050781
3017/28840	Ho your honor cried Mousqueton the man you upset is getting	100.75875091552734
3018/28840	Why didnt thou do as thou didst to the first man said Porth	99.24403381347656
3019/28840	I held the horses my hands were full your	323.77301025390625
3020/28840	A shot was fired that moment Mousqueton shrieked with	77.83920288085938
3021/28840	Ah sir Im hit in the other side exactly opposite the other This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the road to Am	82.40093231201172
3022/28840	Mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the	85.53330993652344
3023/28840	On perceiving the cavaliers DArtagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh besides his horse he found had a carbine on the bow of the	48.22676086425781
3024/28840	Shall we wait or shall we charge   Let us charge them answered the Gas	78.73230743408203
3025/28840	They spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from	70.74114990234375
3026/28840	The king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of	77.86277770996094
3027/28840	Tis well we will see if the kings name is not a passport everywhere replied the Gas	41.1839485168457
3028/28840	Two shots were fired at once one by DArtagnan the other by the adversary of Porth	38.14796829223633
3029/28840	DArtagnans ball took off his enemys	39.48334503173828
3030/28840	The ball fired by Porthoss foe went through the throat of his horse which fell gro	81.27066802978516
3031/28840	For the last time where are you going   To the devil answered DArtagn	20.2842960357666
3032/28840	Good you may be easy thenyoull get	305.7633056640625
3033/28840	DArtagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his hol	26.393747329711914
3034/28840	He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once given him and made his horse	49.28516387939453
3035/28840	The ball struck the animal full in	424.31927490234375
3036/28840	DArtagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one	55.52033996582031
3037/28840	Ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between	85.49751281738281
3038/28840	To the sword sir the sword   And he jumped off his	91.23222351074219
3039/28840	To the swords be it so replied DArtagnan that is exactly what I	34.14463806152344
3040/28840	DArtagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him	114.28105926513672
3041/28840	Twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one	205.68756103515625
3042/28840	Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting	191.42938232421875
3043/28840	At last DArtagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in	51.27335739135742
3044/28840	He brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove	88.44596862792969
3045/28840	Sdeath he cried with his Gascon	61.986576080322266
3046/28840	At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the	87.48176574707031
3047/28840	As to DArtagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the	66.24590301513672
3048/28840	Have a care cried Porthos to his opponent Ive still two pistols	200.9700469970703
3049/28840	The more reason you should fire the first cried his	353.7130432128906
3050/28840	Porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of	58.74104690551758
3051/28840	As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two	57.967063903808594
3052/28840	Athos raised his sword DArtagnan lowered	47.685691833496094
3053/28840	Aramis cried Athos dont fire   Ah ha is it you Aramis said Porth	25.9099178314209
3054/28840	Aramis pushed his back into his saddlebags and sheathed his	40.3079948425293
3055/28840	My son exclaimed Athos extending his hand to DArtagn	12.423402786254883
3056/28840	This was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender	90.49217224121094
3057/28840	So you defend him And I who have sworn to take him dead or alive I am dishonoredand by you   Kill me replied Athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my	64.2839584350586
3058/28840	Oh woe is me woe is me cried the lieutenant theres only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my	145.1748046875
3059/28840	Fifty cavaliers cried the Gascon and Porth	52.315589904785156
3060/28840	Look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the d	75.6379165649414
3061/28840	The two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horse	43.31480026245117
3062/28840	Hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke I fancied you had about twenty men with you so I came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only	79.12077331542969
3063/28840	Yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said Ath	64.18275451660156

3066/28840	Some of the men moved toward	74.63162994384766
3067/28840	One moment my lord whispered Athos and he said something in a low	45.09513854980469
3068/28840	I am too much indebted to you to refuse your first	43.077693939208984
3069/28840	Gentlemen he said to his escort	287.0249938964844
3070/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan Monsieur du Vallon you are	8.992155075073242
3071/28840	The order was obeyed DArtagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large	24.50002098083496
3072/28840	Now DHerblay said Athos dismount and come	39.27558135986328
3073/28840	Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos whilst Athos approached DArtagn	15.709892272949219
3074/28840	Friends said Athos do you regret you have not shed our blood   No replied DArtagnan I regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each	40.580352783203125
3075/28840	Ah nothing will ever go well with us hereafter   Oh Heaven No all is over said Porth	78.03852081298828
3076/28840	Well be on our side now resumed Aram	121.715087890625
3077/28840	Silence DHerblay cried Athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as	68.89568328857422
3078/28840	Tis a matter of conscience with them as with	142.3602294921875
3079/28840	Meantime here we are enemies said Porth	51.44923400878906
3080/28840	Gramercy who would ever have thought it   DArtagnan only	91.75553894042969
3081/28840	Athos looked at them both and took their hands in	61.70612335205078
3082/28840	Gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and	105.94140625
3083/28840	Yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth But we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is	150.24166870117188
3084/28840	For my own part I demand it said Aram	58.31127166748047
3085/28840	Let us choose a place of rendezvous continued Athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each	145.13328552246094
3086/28840	Well then the place   Will the Place Royale suit you asked DArtagn	38.628055572509766
3087/28840	Athos and Aramis looked at each	20.09968376159668

3094/28840	DArtagnan recognized the voice of De Roche	17.151626586914062
3095/28840	Can I do anything for you gentlemen asked the d	29.904752731323242

3098/28840	Adieu we shall meet soon I trust in Paris where you shall have your	108.90406799316406
3099/28840	The duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and	57.96626281738281
3100/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to	20.498079299926758
3101/28840	What do I see cried the	72.4515380859375
3102/28840	Grimaud is it thou   Grimaud signified that he was not	54.15127182006836
3103/28840	And whose horses are these cried DArtagn	51.15645217895508
3104/28840	Who has given them to us said Porth	22.275754928588867
3105/28840	Athos Athos muttered DArtagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman Whither art thou going Grimaud   To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders your	27.160057067871094
3106/28840	They were taking the road toward Paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their	135.26742553710938
3107/28840	It is IMousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the	62.49210739135742
3108/28840	Art thou dangerously wounded my dear Mousqueton he	81.32156372070312
3109/28840	What can we do said DArtagnan we must return to	15.288962364196777
3110/28840	I will take care of Mousqueton said Grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could Grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him	43.81499481201172
3111/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos went on meantime to	16.465316772460938
3112/28840	They were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of DArtagnan and Porth	25.911741256713867
3113/28840	Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against	88.04059600830078
3114/28840	What consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase DArtagnan has done me one good turnhe has destroyed Brous	58.72415542602539
3115/28840	This Gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of	99.61646270751953

3117/28840	The four old Friends prepare to meet	286.79376220703125
3118/28840	What are you eating there Porthos   I am dipping a biscuit in a glass of Spanish wine do the	39.396095275878906
3119/28840	Well how has all gone off   Zounds you know theres only one way of saying things so I went in and said My lord we were not the strongest	88.0365219116211
3120/28840	Yes I know that he said but give me the	48.83894729614258
3121/28840	You know Porthos I could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so I merely said they were fifty and we were	74.00297546386719
3122/28840	There was firing nevertheless I heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day I presume   That is the night my lord I	91.10455322265625
3123/28840	Ah cried the cardinal I thought you were a Gascon my friend   I am a Gascon said I only when I	34.90155029296875
3124/28840	The answer pleased him and he	164.86781311035156
3125/28840	Well theres nothing bad in that it seems to me said Porth	44.51168441772461
3126/28840	Oh mon Dieu no nothing at	107.35281372070312
3127/28840	It was the way in which he	52.78881072998047
3128/28840	It is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine They are veritable sponges Gimblou another	148.6492156982422
3129/28840	The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration DArtagnan enjoyed in the	60.27592086791992
3130/28840	He continued   So I was going away but he called me	48.720428466796875
3131/28840	You have had three horses foundered or killed he asked	329.87591552734375
3132/28840	How much were they worth   Why said Porthos that was very good of him it seems to	45.335567474365234
3133/28840	Oh oh that is a large	63.636837005615234
3134/28840	If he knew anything about horses he would dispute the	114.64970397949219
3135/28840	Faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible	106.98600769042969
3136/28840	He made a great start and looked at	79.10784149169922
3137/28840	I also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in	72.9076919555664
3138/28840	For a thousand pistoles   For a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too	55.118751525878906
3139/28840	And you have them   They are	42.52709197998047
3140/28840	Upon my word I think he acted very	144.66744995117188
3141/28840	Generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service   A great servicewhat was that   Why it seems that I crushed for him a parliament	64.46644592285156
3142/28840	What that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint Jean Cemetery   Thats the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the	52.6864128112793
3143/28840	It seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an	41.98561477661133
3144/28840	See that now said Porthos and I turned my horse aside from going plump on to him That will be for another	115.31295013427734
3145/28840	He owed me for the councillor the pettifogger   But said Porthos if he was not crushed completely   Ah Monsieur de Richelieu would have said Five hundred crowns for the	30.53985023498535
3146/28840	Well lets say no more about	79.0429458618164
3147/28840	How much were your animals worth Porthos   Ah if poor Mousqueton were here he could tell you to a	69.47496032714844
3148/28840	No matter you can tell within ten crown	222.87252807617188
3149/28840	Why Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the	79.67021179199219
3150/28840	There will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said DArtagnan content	25.29336166381836
3151/28840	Yes said Porthos but there are the equip	30.91658592224121
3152/28840	Well how much for the equipments   If we say one hundred pistoles for the three   Good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and	46.34939956665039
3153/28840	We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said DArtagnan and share the three	34.829246520996094
3154/28840	A paltry piece of business murmured DArtagnan crumpling his	39.49892807006836
3155/28840	Pooh said Porthos it is always	27.736112594604492
3156/28840	Stop I want to remember his exact	257.9539794921875
3157/28840	He said As to your friend tell him he may sleep in	126.96756744384766
3158/28840	Good very good said Porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a bar	43.583805084228516
3159/28840	Ah yes said Porthos there is nine o	27.102567672729492
3160/28840	We have a rendezvous you remember at the Place	48.17251968383789
3161/28840	Ah stop hold your peace Porthos dont remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since	114.23453521728516
3162/28840	Because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our	64.55008697509766
3163/28840	And yet said Porthos neither of them had any advantage over	95.77445220947266
3164/28840	I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in	316.3465576171875
3165/28840	We must go said the superb lord of Bracieux lest they should say we were	84.63459014892578
3166/28840	We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place	123.52941131591797
3167/28840	Yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of	95.86162567138672
3168/28840	Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms	98.12205505371094
3169/28840	We discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going today to learn something else   You really have some distrust then said Porth	51.307376861572266
3170/28840	Of Aramis yes since he has become an abb	34.27055358886719
3171/28840	You cant imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he	57.96889114379883
3172/28840	He sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his	54.540225982666016
3173/28840	Ah as regards Aramis that is another thing said Porthos and it wouldnt surprise me at	40.14625549316406
3174/28840	Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on	25.091745376586914
3175/28840	Nonsense He had us in his power and he let us	121.0422592163086
3176/28840	Besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let Planchet post himself behind us with his carb	97.46724700927734
3177/28840	Devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said Porth	116.97854614257812
3178/28840	Ah if Mousqueton were here theres a fellow who will never desert me   So long as you are rich Ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites	57.98683166503906
3179/28840	It is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfish	84.74581146240234
3180/28840	Yes you are right let us go Porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were	55.4836311340332
3181/28840	Halloo Planchet here saddle our horses take your carb	170.9358367919922
3182/28840	Whom are we going to attack sir   No one a mere matter of precaution answered the Gas	69.02346801757812
3183/28840	You know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor Broussel the father of the people   Really did they said DArtagn	43.27045822143555
3184/28840	He was carried home in the arms of the	51.51774215698242
3185/28840	His house has been full ever	458.6851806640625
3186/28840	He has received visits from the coadjutor from Madame de Longueville and the Prince de Conti Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his	17.358591079711914
3187/28840	And now whenever he wishes   Well whenever he wishes   Planchet began to sing   Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce matin Je crois quil gronde Contre le Maz	48.531700134277344
3188/28840	Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce mat	64.82979583740234
3189/28840	It doesnt surprise me said DArtagnan in a low tone to Porthos that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the life out of his	37.93263626098633
3190/28840	From Friquet I know that name   A son of Monsieur de Broussels servant and a lad that I promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the	42.49907684326172
3191/28840	Is he not a singing boy at Notre Dame asked DArtagn	65.6200180053711
3192/28840	Yes that is the very boy hes patronized by Baz	141.36361694335938
3193/28840	Of what importance is this little reptile to you asked Porth	47.67820358276367
3194/28840	Gad replied DArtagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same	43.26948928833008
3195/28840	Whilst all this was going on Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by the Faubourg	44.8653564453125
3196/28840	They had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed	44.76312255859375
3197/28840	Bazin was their only attendant for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of Mousqu	66.75444030761719
3198/28840	As they were passing onward Athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the	109.34224700927734
3199/28840	Oh no dear count cried Aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to   What do you mean Aramis   That the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois and nothing	30.119054794311523
3200/28840	What our friends   Are become our most dangerous enemies Ath	202.86814880371094
3201/28840	Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble	171.30531311035156
3202/28840	What can you expect Athos Men are so made and we are not always twenty years	84.45096588134766
3203/28840	We have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which DArtagnan is blindly	54.439674377441406
3204/28840	Did you not observe his despair on the journey As to Porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that	68.54986572265625
3205/28840	Well he found us on his road and will not be baron this	72.4219741821289
3206/28840	Perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this	73.11713409423828
3207/28840	But suppose they come unarmed What a disgrace to	344.701904296875
3208/28840	Oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents	175.2855224609375
3209/28840	Go in whatever guise you choose for my part I shall go	78.48503112792969
3210/28840	No for I will not allow you to do	18.727863311767578
3211/28840	Tis not one man not Athos only not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon	47.17742156982422
3212/28840	Be it so then replied Athos sorrow	73.30760192871094
3213/28840	And they pursued their road in mournful	239.8939666748047
3214/28840	They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the	28.383501052856445
3215/28840	Athos therefore commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same	62.498008728027344
3216/28840	They then advanced two and two and saluted each other	256.7091064453125
3217/28840	The gate is shut said Aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion I will get the key from the Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well	75.22313690185547
3218/28840	DArtagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the	28.025428771972656
3219/28840	Porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the	72.85830688476562
3220/28840	If you prefer any other place said Athos in his persuasive voice choose for	97.79871368408203
3221/28840	This place if Monsieur dHerblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the	53.66254806518555
3222/28840	Aramis went off at once begging Athos not to remain alone within reach of DArtagnan and Porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous	31.921226501464844
3223/28840	Aramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan who was saying to him   You swear sir that it is not so   Stop and Aramis gave him a louis d	42.02577590942383
3224/28840	Ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his	33.90190505981445
3225/28840	Well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are excellent	99.4218978881836
3226/28840	Yes certainly added Athos and the other	59.89763641357422
3227/28840	DArtagnan had heard the conversation and had understood	25.730531692504883
3228/28840	What do I see   That he wouldnt	49.71904373168945
3229/28840	Swear what   That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place Royale to	45.351741790771484
3230/28840	And Aramis wouldnt swear  	63.282012939453125
3231/28840	Attention then   Athos did not lose sight of the two	37.795589447021484
3232/28840	Aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that DArtagnan and Porthos might	32.9840087890625
3233/28840	Do you see whispered Aramis to Athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the Gascon wore under his	52.7894172668457
3234/28840	Alas I do replied Athos with a deep	50.8584098815918
3235/28840	He entered third and Aramis who shut the gate after him	191.21263122558594
3236/28840	The two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective	118.63975524902344
3237/28840	They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the limet	54.46793746948242
3238/28840	There were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from Athos Porthos and DArtagnan sat down the two others stood in front of	40.16271209716797
3239/28840	After a few minutes of silent embarrassment Athos	156.34176635742188
3240/28840	Gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach	120.00413513183594
3241/28840	Hear me count replied DArtagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest	72.20787811279297
3242/28840	I wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or Monsieur dHerblay If so speak out answered Ath	38.44456481933594
3243/28840	You asked for candor and you have	56.75777053833008
3244/28840	You ask what I have against you I tell	55.815406799316406
3245/28840	And I have the same sincerity to show you if you wish Monsieur dHerblay I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived	28.94196319580078
3246/28840	Really monsieur you say strange things said Aram	38.387996673583984
3247/28840	You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them No you sounded me nothing	130.04832458496094
3248/28840	Very well what did I say to you that Mazarin was contemptible and that I wouldnt serve Maz	49.19801712036133
3249/28840	Did I tell you that I wouldnt serve any other On the contrary I gave you to understand I think that I adhered to the	40.44525146484375
3250/28840	We even joked very pleasantly if I remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my	86.05643463134766
3251/28840	Were you a party man There is no doubt of	108.49288940429688
3252/28840	Well why should not we too belong to a party You had your secret and we had ours we didnt exchange	236.2414093017578
3253/28840	So much the better it proves that we know how to keep our	72.04914855957031
3254/28840	I do not reproach you monsieur said DArtagnan tis only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your	16.41568946838379
3255/28840	And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked Aramis haught	60.97637176513672
3256/28840	The blood mounted instantly to the temples of DArtagnan who arose and replied   I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jes	58.514102935791016
3257/28840	On seeing DArtagnan rise Porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each	54.54987335205078
3258/28840	Upon hearing DArtagnans reply Aramis seemed about to draw his sword when Athos prevented	48.840065002441406
3259/28840	DArtagnan he said you are here tonight still infuriated by yesterdays	36.8345832824707
3260/28840	I believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an	74.82001495361328
3261/28840	Come do you really think you have anything to say against me Say it then if I am in fault I will avow the	45.239376068115234
3262/28840	The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of Aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated	107.07022094726562
3263/28840	At that time I was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me However because I was prudent you must not take me for a	38.50542068481445
3264/28840	If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur dHerblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder I could have spoken	50.191951751708984
3265/28840	What are you meddling with cried Aramis pale with anger suspecting that DArtagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longue	36.72417068481445
3266/28840	Porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a	69.62064361572266
3267/28840	He said yes and he put his hand on his	38.39540481567383
3268/28840	DArtagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his	70.69259643554688
3269/28840	Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his	54.5172004699707
3270/28840	Then turning to Aramis   Aramis he said break your	47.61255645751953
3271/28840	It must be done said Athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he	86.64945220947266
3272/28840	Then Aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with	79.83567810058594

3277/28840	There was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by Aram	114.3143081665039

3281/28840	My son exclaimed Athos pressing him in his	55.755126953125

3283/28840	Forsooth If I were obliged to fight against you I think I should allow myself to be pierced through and through for I never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced Ath	66.54690551757812
3284/28840	My friends said Athos this is what I expected from such hearts as	75.66093444824219

3303/28840	With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had	121.23773193359375
3304/28840	Very well sir said the host Ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the	68.17906188964844
3305/28840	Do as you like said Raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant	101.52243041992188
3306/28840	The host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the	223.28921508789062

3312/28840	I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward	92.50204467773438
3313/28840	You will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in	57.75456619262695

3315/28840	It seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which I did not dare to question you since you told me	62.163902282714844
3316/28840	I have therefore as you see great need of hearing from	125.70185089111328

3319/28840	During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also	173.76095581054688
3320/28840	Raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at Sen	106.30484008789062
3321/28840	The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round	173.03945922851562
3322/28840	Let us try and overtake this gentleman said Raoul to Olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable	93.3902587890625
3323/28840	It was about four oclock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of	43.9720458984375
3324/28840	He had stopped like Raoul at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle the best at Compiegne and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at Noy	46.88692855834961
3325/28840	Well let us sleep at Noyon said Ra	31.95587921142578
3326/28840	Sir replied Olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this	45.00577926635742
3327/28840	I think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early	77.55563354492188
3328/28840	Eighteen leagues is enough for the first	200.50733947753906
3329/28840	The horses will have a long nights rest and at five oclock tomorrow morning we can be again on the	52.06706237792969
3330/28840	Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master gr	360.39385986328125
3331/28840	Go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day tomorrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after tomorrow five and in three days you will be in	110.95462036132812
3332/28840	There you must rest young people are such bragg	179.24244689941406
3333/28840	It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the Planchets and the Grimaud	31.04758644104004
3334/28840	Raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his	78.23502349853516
3335/28840	DArtagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with	52.78963088989258
3336/28840	A little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to	58.49624252319336
3337/28840	Raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for Oliv	88.67988586425781
3338/28840	At this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the	40.08538055419922
3339/28840	Raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his	69.23089599609375
3340/28840	Olivain he exclaimed what do I see below there   A second scream more piercing than the first now	152.04806518554688
3341/28840	Oh sir cried Olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is	82.0620346069336
3342/28840	But what do I see in the watersomething struggling   Oh yes exclaimed Raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider   They are sinking cried Olivain in his	45.71596145629883
3343/28840	Ah sir cried Olivain what are you doing Good God   Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in	50.1303596496582
3344/28840	This was in fact a custom familiar to	104.340576171875
3345/28840	Having been brought up on the banks of the Loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum	50.362056732177734
3346/28840	Athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undert	76.76972198486328
3347/28840	Oh heavens continued Olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now   The count would do as I do replied Raoul urging his horse vigorously	65.4616928100586
3348/28840	A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but	76.58529663085938
3349/28840	Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently	164.41969299316406
3350/28840	The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms	94.43913269042969
3351/28840	One moment longer and all would	1158.251708984375
3352/28840	Courage cried Raoul courage   Too late murmured the young man too late   The water closed above his head and stifled his	45.3333740234375
3353/28840	Raoul at the same time seized one of the young mans hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning	48.085426330566406
3354/28840	Thus sure that the rider would not release his hold Raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with	92.64983367919922
3355/28840	All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the	102.35581970214844
3356/28840	Saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched	305.4356994628906
3357/28840	A moment later the grayheaded man was beside	244.68060302734375
3358/28840	Olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the	65.86107635498047
3359/28840	Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved	40.12538528442383
3360/28840	Ah sir he exclaimed it was you Without you I was a dead manthrice	122.39393615722656
3361/28840	But one recovers sir as you perceive replied Raoul and we have but had a little	87.0223159790039
3362/28840	Oh sir what gratitude I feel exclaimed the man with gray	139.87294006347656
3363/28840	Ah there you are my good DArminges I have given you a great fright have I not but it is your own	57.284324645996094
3364/28840	You were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim   Oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal	23.67119026184082
3365/28840	But how did the accident happen asked Ra	107.2977523803711
3366/28840	Oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of	99.66192626953125
3367/28840	We were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat	65.82691955566406
3368/28840	Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the	176.05348205566406
3369/28840	I cannot swim and dared not throw myself into the	60.4969482421875
3370/28840	Sir replied Raoul bowing I am entirely at your service I assure	18.79511260986328
3371/28840	I am called the Count de Guiche continued the young man my father is the Marechal de Grammont and now that you know who I am do me the honor to inform me who you	23.572622299194336
3372/28840	I am the Viscount de Bragelonne answered Raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the Count de Guiche had	19.83777618408203
3373/28840	Viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already	105.40164947509766
3374/28840	Sir said Raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand I like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend I beseech	66.5732421875
3375/28840	And now where are you going viscount inquired De Gu	49.811283111572266
3376/28840	To join the army under the prince	250.67984008789062
3377/28840	And I too exclaimed the young man in a transport of	46.71542739868164
3378/28840	Oh so much the better we will fire the first shot	95.73121643066406
3379/28840	It is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to	122.53840637207031
3380/28840	And now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom I gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the	82.65223693847656
3381/28840	Linen and wine are both being warmed	743.0423583984375
3382/28840	The young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very	67.0382080078125
3383/28840	They mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between	259.535888671875
3384/28840	They were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent	487.5191650390625
3385/28840	De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than Raoul who was only	33.378334045410156
3386/28840	The halt at Noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound	161.98858642578125
3387/28840	Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive but Grimaud did not	163.14039611816406
3388/28840	Doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted	187.84356689453125
3389/28840	The Count de Guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by Raoul who came to wish him good	41.38166427612305
3390/28840	They breakfasted in haste and at six oclock had already gone ten	65.3087387084961
3391/28840	The young counts conversation was most interesting to Raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and	217.3641815185547
3392/28840	Scarrons house he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen	127.79582977294922
3393/28840	Guiche knew everybodyMadame de Neuillan Mademoiselle dAubigne Mademoiselle de Scudery Mademoiselle Paulet Madame de Chevre	26.212421417236328
3394/28840	Raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her	86.43445587158203
3395/28840	Then came the question of gallantry and love	187.52944946289062
3396/28840	Under this head also Bragelonne had much more to hear than to	68.69059753417969
3397/28840	He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his	55.78369140625
3398/28840	De Guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to	39.402828216552734
3399/28840	The young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of	156.42721557617188
3400/28840	The day passed away as rapidly as an	94.2334213256836
3401/28840	The horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at Arras at four oclock in the	44.781166076660156
3402/28840	They were approaching the scene of war and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras they determined to remain in the town until the mor	67.28508758544922
3403/28840	The French army held all between PontaMarc as far as Valenciennes falling back upon Dou	212.41664123535156
3404/28840	The prince was said to be in person at Beth	88.46220397949219
3405/28840	An approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached	168.5599822998047
3406/28840	The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportune	121.67666625976562
3407/28840	The evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the	100.59351348876953
3408/28840	In the morning it was rumored that Prince de Condé had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former	59.39790725708008
3409/28840	But as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if	124.0213394165039
3410/28840	The counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of Lens and that of Beth	80.37924194335938
3411/28840	They obtained information at Ablain and a statement of their route was left for Grim	165.52801513671875
3412/28840	About seven oclock in the morning they set	20.74013328552246
3413/28840	De Guiche who was young and impulsive said to Raoul Here we are three masters and three	91.19400024414062
3414/28840	Our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough	88.22521209716797
3415/28840	I have never seen him put to the test replied Raoul but he is a Breton which promises	72.44884490966797
3416/28840	Yes yes resumed De Guiche I am sure he can fire a musket when	78.3291244506836
3417/28840	On my side I have two sure men who have been in action with my	102.39623260498047
3418/28840	We therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them Raoul   Certainly sir replied the vis	96.93302917480469
3419/28840	Holloa young peoplestop there said the tutor joining in the	439.7485656738281
3420/28840	De Guiche and Raoul glanced at each other	38.103614807128906
3421/28840	There they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself between Cambria and La Venth	58.352882385253906

3429/28840	Olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six muskets	71.1913833618164
3430/28840	The tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gall	58.1179313659668
3431/28840	The young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the	174.64678955078125
3432/28840	Were you stopped eagerly inquired the two	480.22186279296875
3433/28840	No replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your	40.53383255004883

3440/28840	Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready	355.1959533691406
3441/28840	In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced	49.82502746582031

3450/28840	The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered	127.42962646484375
3451/28840	De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the Spaniard who had advanced to meet Raoul aimed in his turn and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a	63.58496856689453

3453/28840	Struck in the breast and extending his arms the Spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him	61.236751556396484
3454/28840	Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of Athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was	67.96749114990234
3455/28840	His horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling Raouls leg under its	288.1036071777344

3463/28840	My antagonist took flight replied De Guiche and left me at liberty to come to your	108.71868133544922

3468/28840	Faith no thank Heaven replied Raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering   I fear we arrived too	49.551448822021484
3469/28840	They have killed them I think and taken flight carrying off their boot	323.80682373046875

3508/28840	The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the	50.281036376953125
3509/28840	Raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything need	75.14326477050781

3511/28840	The host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward Gre	155.34613037109375
3512/28840	Chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously	180.17733764648438
3513/28840	He was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much older from ascetic	76.7564697265625
3514/28840	Sir began Raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic   Why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely	33.1937141418457
3515/28840	Because we want to know said De Guiche haught	46.7949333190918
3516/28840	The stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his	131.158203125
3517/28840	In a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his	72.94709014892578

3519/28840	I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask	57.45847702026367
3520/28840	It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monks	217.46360778808594
3521/28840	In the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Gu	29.978763580322266
3522/28840	Nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the	116.3023452758789
3523/28840	The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that Raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an	63.85188293457031
3524/28840	He is some Spanish or Flemish spy said he putting his hand to his	60.3328857421875

3536/28840	I confess I am accustomed to priests of a very different	85.41455078125
3537/28840	Ah exclaimed De Guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from Heaven on them they are mostly foreignersScotch Irish or	61.9360237121582
3538/28840	As ugly   No but reasonably	104.2218246459961

3540/28840	Absolution comes not from him who administers it but from	254.460693359375

3542/28840	You are of my opinion are you not viscount and I see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy fathers	42.1241340637207
3543/28840	Yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder	35.69035720825195
3544/28840	Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path   Never answered De Gu	92.51223754882812

3547/28840	They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur dArming	37.74650955200195
3548/28840	There is the wounded man said De Guiche passing close to the Augustine	65.26020050048828

3577/28840	Just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the	55.35102844238281
3578/28840	What does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just	109.84957885742188
3579/28840	The traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing	40.07501220703125
3580/28840	Ah diable said the host to himself this man seems	184.67050170898438
3581/28840	And where will your worship drink   There answered the traveler pointing to the	92.53230285644531
3582/28840	I was mistaken said the host hes not quite	92.10706329345703
3583/28840	And what else does your worship wish for   To know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom   The Viscount de Bragelonne   Just	27.336402893066406
3584/28840	Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud   The traveler made a sign of ass	21.944671630859375
3585/28840	Well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambr	34.07732391357422
3586/28840	How far is Mazingarbe   Two miles and a	104.97480773925781
3587/28840	Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying	67.98674011230469
3588/28840	What is that said he whence comes that cry   From the wounded mans room replied the	103.70497131347656
3589/28840	What wounded man   The former executioner of Bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by Spaniards and who is now being confessed by an Augustine fri	42.44259262084961
3590/28840	The old executioner of Bethune muttered Grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard   That is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the	68.24798583984375
3591/28840	I have seen him once replied Grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of	122.68018341064453
3592/28840	At this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was	98.31351470947266
3593/28840	The three listeners looked at one another in	217.73939514160156
3594/28840	We must see what it is said Grim	36.1693229675293
3595/28840	It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the	73.45187377929688
3596/28840	Mon Dieu said the woman crossing	108.6199722290039
3597/28840	If Grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other	51.1192741394043
3598/28840	Open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk   No	226.41302490234375
3599/28840	Unfasten it or I will break it in said Grim	130.89012145996094
3600/28840	The same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the	66.56889343261719
3601/28840	The room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had	78.29779052734375
3602/28840	The monk cried the host where is the monk   Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the	42.4732666015625
3603/28840	He has escaped by this means exclaimed	134.5112762451172
3604/28840	Do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the	84.68755340576172
3605/28840	There is no mule cried he to whom this question was	87.22875213623047
3606/28840	The host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst Grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the	58.34147644042969
3607/28840	There can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said	39.626502990722656
3608/28840	Does he still live inquired the inn	290.13153076171875
3609/28840	Making no reply Grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming pall	71.58277130126953
3610/28840	The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the execution	42.64388656616211
3611/28840	Run run for help cried Grimaud and I will remain beside him	97.78766632080078
3612/28840	The host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands	58.084381103515625
3613/28840	This is what had taken place We have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a	53.72124481201172
3614/28840	Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing	74.11092376708984
3615/28840	He was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their	63.297855377197266
3616/28840	And besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as conf	130.27944946289062
3617/28840	The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded	42.009376525878906
3618/28840	The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to	38.5842399597168
3619/28840	He made a movement of surprise and said   Father you are very	39.084964752197266
3620/28840	Men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dry	259.4956970214844
3621/28840	Alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments I need a	172.44483947753906
3622/28840	Do you suffer much asked the	149.17225646972656
3623/28840	Yes but in my soul much more than in my	88.48616790771484
3624/28840	I still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno	396.49810791015625
3625/28840	Tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely	98.87711334228516
3626/28840	That is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession I have distributed to the poor I have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing	71.49697875976562
3627/28840	All have forgiven me some have even loved me but I think that God has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that womans ghost rising before	85.90080261230469
3628/28840	A woman You have assassinated a woman then cried the	174.34715270996094

3630/28840	The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly   Go on I know nothing as yet when you have finished your story God and I will	92.6540298461914
3631/28840	The executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his	40.558204650878906
3632/28840	Delirium he repeated delirium do you say Oh no I remember too	88.78401184082031
3633/28840	It was evening I had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride	147.60499572753906
3634/28840	After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of	79.48876190185547
3635/28840	But let me see how was it done Speak said the	90.86038208007812
3636/28840	A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed	63.343116760253906
3637/28840	I reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem	285.1910095214844
3638/28840	We traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without	211.77291870117188
3639/28840	At length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be	72.18136596679688
3640/28840	And you obeyed   Father that woman was a	95.51445007324219
3641/28840	It was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brotherinlaw she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving England she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be	83.81410217285156
3642/28840	The woman was English then   No she was French but she had married in	160.67112731933594
3643/28840	The monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the	100.07865905761719
3644/28840	The executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his	64.04536437988281
3645/28840	No no I am here said the monk quickly coming back to	72.30117797851562

3651/28840	I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so	134.38401794433594
3652/28840	The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not	130.31338500976562

3658/28840	Oh yes it is she   A voice of strange sweetness   How do you know it   The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became l	27.422887802124023
3659/28840	And you killed her the monk	404.50750732421875

3662/28840	Oh father do not look in that way at me Oh I am guilty then you will not pardon me   The monk recovered his usual	54.095115661621094
3663/28840	Yes yes he said I will pardon you if you tell me	26.059064865112305

3671/28840	Her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name Speak or no absolution   The dying man collected all his	72.78871154785156
3672/28840	Anne de Bueil murmured the wounded	21.56412124633789
3673/28840	Anne de Bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to	64.18269348144531

3684/28840	The executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his	56.01348114013672
3685/28840	Grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his	63.66809844970703

3687/28840	Who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on Grim	85.2333755493164
3688/28840	You and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before	77.17778778076172
3689/28840	Under what circumstances did we meet he asked	183.5476531982422
3690/28840	One night twenty years ago my master fetched you from Bethune and conducted you to Armentie	67.23460388183594
3691/28840	I know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four gro	43.96588897705078
3692/28840	Where do you come from now   I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my	90.95943450927734
3693/28840	They told me the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing	116.73638153076172
3694/28840	At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it	78.218017578125
3695/28840	And the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk   What monk   The monk that was shut in with	56.21576690673828
3696/28840	No he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the	59.93749237060547
3697/28840	Was he the man that stabbed you   Yes said the execution	55.85012435913086
3698/28840	Grimaud moved as if to leave the	155.80628967285156
3699/28840	What are you going to do asked the wounded	13.771844863891602
3700/28840	Do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done	112.54143524169922
3701/28840	Now I may hope that God will forgive me since my crime is exp	121.35334777832031
3702/28840	The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill   Milady   Yes Milady it is true you called her	63.66236114501953
3703/28840	What has the monk to do with this Milady   She was his	39.256935119628906
3704/28840	Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden	118.65921783447266
3705/28840	But does he know this secret then   I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in	70.44852447509766
3706/28840	Grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the	135.2010040283203
3707/28840	Touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn I shall	69.5203857421875
3708/28840	Grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed   Oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is	82.41779327392578
3709/28840	Haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends	136.04605102539062
3710/28840	My death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misad	43.00013732910156
3711/28840	Where was the monk going asked Grim	122.81028747558594
3712/28840	Who stopped him   Two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mentionthe Viscount de Bragel	34.48480224609375
3713/28840	And it was this young man who brought the monk to you Then it was the will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued Grim	74.5086669921875
3714/28840	And yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so   On ones deathbed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with ones own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his	99.98755645751953
3715/28840	Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la F	42.39834976196289
3716/28840	Whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the	142.82687377929688
3717/28840	The surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have f	64.121826171875
3718/28840	We must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant	78.31302642822266
3719/28840	The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud who turned away his	47.66611099243164
3720/28840	The weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly fright	67.28492736816406
3721/28840	Then Grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his	56.698585510253906
3722/28840	Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself travelstained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy execution	49.34046936035156
3723/28840	Grimaud my good Grimaud exclaimed Raoul here you are at last Excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a	74.99778747558594

3733/28840	What You start for Paris You are mistaken it is Olivain who leaves me you are to	83.5377197265625
3734/28840	On the contrary Olivain is to stay and I am to	71.09741973876953
3735/28840	I have come for nothing else but to tell you	40.33067321777344
3736/28840	But what is the meaning of this change   I cannot tell	19.296794891357422
3737/28840	Come tell me what is the joke   Monsieur le vicomte knows that I never	20.066530227661133
3738/28840	Yes but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to	19.452152252197266
3739/28840	Perhaps you mean to disobey me   Yes monsieur I	13.698491096496582
3740/28840	You persist then   Yes I am going may you be happy monsieur and Grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go	39.00452423095703
3741/28840	Raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the	83.50020599365234
3742/28840	Grimaud he cried remain I wish	505.8133239746094
3743/28840	Then replied Grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be	19.770666122436523
3744/28840	He saluted and made a movement to	105.52767181396484
3745/28840	Grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety Speak speak in Heavens name And Raoul fell back trembling upon his	76.89541625976562
3746/28840	I can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my	36.895572662353516
3747/28840	You met a monk did you not  	49.05815124511719
3748/28840	The young men looked at each other with an expression of	19.396535873413086
3749/28840	You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet	51.84656524658203
3750/28840	And without adding another word Grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the	54.05170822143555
3751/28840	Two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was Grimaud on his way to	58.64414978027344
3752/28840	When once in the saddle Grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no	110.25895690917969
3753/28840	But Grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post	83.13215637207031
3754/28840	Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out The Spaniards the Spaniards   That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccup	66.91962432861328
3755/28840	The young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of Houdin and Beth	76.9424057006836
3756/28840	While Monsieur dArminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body of infantry and	38.34063720703125
3757/28840	This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire	82.43013763427734
3758/28840	There was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur dArminges and beat a	41.757774353027344
3759/28840	Olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his	81.09302520751953
3760/28840	As a further precaution they had bound his	279.794677734375
3761/28840	The little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin where they expected to find the	51.43941116333008
3762/28840	But he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemys	39.53812789916992
3763/28840	He questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been	151.89015197753906
3764/28840	The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of	125.00138854980469
3765/28840	Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely	192.62945556640625
3766/28840	The prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to Marshal de Grammont that some one wished to see	74.30133056640625
3767/28840	The Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went	91.56304931640625
3768/28840	The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing	57.885501861572266
3769/28840	Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was	79.32159423828125
3770/28840	The prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking itit was the noise of	64.0158462524414
3771/28840	The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the	73.37464904785156
3772/28840	Speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual	212.97647094726562
3773/28840	The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is	107.51091003417969
3774/28840	It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his	72.26608276367188
3775/28840	Besides he had long known the prince whilst Raoul now saw him for the first	55.00328063964844
3776/28840	He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingar	62.64104080200195
3777/28840	Meanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of Rocroy Fribourg and Nordling	104.20523071289062
3778/28840	At the first words of the Count de Guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood	75.4134521484375
3779/28840	The enemy was marching upon Lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from France the army of	191.56333923339844
3780/28840	But in what force was the enemy Was it a corps sent out to make a diversion Was it an entire army To this question De Guiche could not	149.0777587890625
3781/28840	Now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise	315.43719482421875
3782/28840	Certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a	80.56234741210938
3783/28840	My lord said Raoul blushing might examine the Spanish	98.02880096435547
3784/28840	Have you a Spanish prisoner cried the	169.5578155517578
3785/28840	Ah that is true said De Guiche I had forgotten	28.100317001342773
3786/28840	That is easily understood it was you who took him count said Raoul	61.914466857910156
3787/28840	The old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed   The young man is right let the prisoner be brought	77.93681335449219
3788/28840	Meanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man	93.01920318603516
3789/28840	Monsieur said the prince turning toward Raoul I know that you have a letter from my sister Madame de Longueville but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good	30.26558494567871
3790/28840	My lord said Raoul coloring up I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the	51.34079360961914
3791/28840	Very well said the prince give it to me	92.90203857421875
3792/28840	Here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most	118.37850189208984
3793/28840	The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spo	108.6518325805664
3794/28840	Since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he	38.47256851196289
3795/28840	The prince looked at him with unspeakable	40.512413024902344
3796/28840	Of what country are you asked the	108.73936462402344
3797/28840	The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign	86.45279693603516
3798/28840	Ah ah it seems that he is a Spani	48.46328353881836
3799/28840	Do you speak Spanish Grammont   Faith my lord but indifferent	50.583499908447266
3800/28840	And I not at all said the prince	81.75106811523438
3801/28840	Gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak Spanish and serve me as interpreter   I can my lord said Ra	72.45137023925781
3802/28840	Ah you speak Spanish   Enough I think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this	72.17538452148438
3803/28840	Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking	63.407691955566406
3804/28840	My lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest Cast	47.81316375732422
3805/28840	Ich bin ein Deutscher replied the	885.7557983398438
3806/28840	What in the devil does he say asked the	47.161705017089844
3807/28840	What new gibberish is that   He says he is German my lord replied Raoul but I doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation	74.72239685058594
3808/28840	Then you speak German also asked the	272.3758850097656
3809/28840	Well enough to question him in that language   Yes my	32.082908630371094
3810/28840	Raoul began the examination but the result justified his	603.83203125
3811/28840	The prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what Raoul said to him and Raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsat	68.15955352783203
3812/28840	However amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination Raoul had recognized his natural	156.45870971679688
3813/28840	Non siete Spagnuolo he said non siete Tedesco siete Italian	106.03313446044922
3814/28840	The prisoner started and bit his	150.2471923828125
3815/28840	Ah that said the prince I understand that language thoroughly and since he is Italian I will myself continue the	113.7653579711914
3816/28840	Thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and I appoint you from this moment my	60.9954833984375
3817/28840	But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the	99.55620574951172
3818/28840	Therefore he knew nothing either of the enemys numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the	50.842864990234375
3819/28840	Very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he doesnt wish to	93.08370971679688
3820/28840	The two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to Marshal de Grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had	46.65182113647461
3821/28840	When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner	48.714073181152344
3822/28840	The soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him	257.3042297363281
3823/28840	One moment said the prisoner in	237.28695678710938
3824/28840	I am ready to speak my	27.82602310180664
3825/28840	Ah ah said the prince laughing I thought we should come to	58.04534149169922
3826/28840	I have a sure method of limbering	190.4992218017578
3827/28840	Young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in	70.23272705078125
3828/28840	But on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be	82.67698669433594
3829/28840	Where did the army cross the Lys   Between SaintVenant and A	234.0069580078125
3830/28840	By whom is it commanded   By Count de Fuonsaldagna General Beck and the archdu	55.08921813964844
3831/28840	Of how many does it consist   Eighteen thousand men and thirtysix	100.17544555664062
3832/28840	And its aim is  	572.2355346679688
3833/28840	You see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other	40.589256286621094
3834/28840	Yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human	47.22962188720703
3835/28840	Recall Le Plessis Bellievre Villequier and DErlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the	137.0323486328125
3836/28840	Let them hold themselves in readiness to march	252.1658477783203
3837/28840	Tomorrow according to all probability we shall attack the	91.90630340576172
3838/28840	But my lord said Marshal de Grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand	59.02791976928711
3839/28840	Monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are	70.53211975097656
3840/28840	Then turning toward the prisoner Take away that man he said and keep him carefully in	175.16310119628906
3841/28840	His life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be	90.13584899902344
3842/28840	Count de Guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with	36.97547149658203
3843/28840	Monsieur he continued addressing Raoul if you are not too tired follow	57.62321472167969
3844/28840	To the end of the world my lord cried Raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his	61.52096939086914
3845/28840	The prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated	134.78060913085938
3846/28840	Come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in	45.50963592529297
3847/28840	And I said the marshal what am I to do   Wait here to receive the	72.72904205322266
3848/28840	I shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to	81.13441467285156
3849/28840	Twenty guards well mounted are all that I shall need for my	146.82614135742188
3850/28840	That is very few said the marsh	56.29723358154297
3851/28840	Have you a good horse Monsieur de Bragelonne   My horse was killed this morning my lord and I am mounted provisionally on my lac	31.242456436157227
3852/28840	Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like	145.97259521484375
3853/28840	No false modesty take the best horse you can	138.8059539794922
3854/28840	You will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it	136.2716827392578
3855/28840	Now monsieur he said to Raoul will you give me the letter you have brought   Raoul handed the letter to the	21.014036178588867
3856/28840	The prince read as he hastened	114.92403411865234
3857/28840	Monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of	46.70815658569336
3858/28840	I have only to say after the little that I have seen and heard that I think even better of you than I have been	56.576351165771484
3859/28840	Meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to Lens the noise of the cannon sounded	90.1796646118164
3860/28840	The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of	64.1900405883789
3861/28840	One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his	94.50579833984375
3862/28840	From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a	78.14244842529297
3863/28840	At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of Aun	55.67625045776367
3864/28840	The report of Spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was	128.03907775878906
3865/28840	The women had already fled taking refuge in Vitry only a few men	275.9236755371094
3866/28840	On seeing the prince they hastened to meet	43.869056701660156
3867/28840	Ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robbers   Yes said the prince if you will serve me as	40.49547576904297
3868/28840	Where does your highness wish to go   To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surrounding country   In that case Im your	59.983299255371094
3869/28840	I can trust youyou are a true Frenchman   I am an old soldier of Rocroy my	33.7347526550293
3870/28840	Here said the prince handing him a purse here is for Roc	92.04146575927734
3871/28840	Now do you want a horse or will you go afoot   Afoot my lord I have served always in the	58.17230224609375
3872/28840	Besides I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to	97.76878356933594
3873/28840	Come then said the prince let us lose no	36.10287094116211
3874/28840	The peasant started off running before the princes horse then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the	97.77969360351562
3875/28840	For a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the	113.13447570800781
3876/28840	At length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountains	139.08056640625
3877/28840	The prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the	96.43016052246094
3878/28840	He then began to ascend the	98.65016174316406
3879/28840	In about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding	57.203857421875
3880/28840	At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on Lens at bay and before Lens the enemys entire	81.70207977294922
3881/28840	With a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from Lens as far as Vim	108.92204284667969
3882/28840	In a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save France the second time from invasion was unrolled in his	54.6351318359375
3883/28840	He took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote   My Dear MarshalIn an hour Lens will be in the enemys	59.272003173828125
3884/28840	Come and rejoin me bring with you the whole	80.24627685546875
3885/28840	I shall be at Vendin to place it in	131.5775146484375
3886/28840	Tomorrow we shall retake Lens and beat the	250.9774169921875
3887/28840	Then turning toward Raoul Go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Gram	35.14262008666992
3888/28840	Raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gall	101.2145767211914
3889/28840	A quarter of an hour later he was with the marsh	30.74003791809082
3890/28840	A portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to	147.52392578125
3891/28840	Marshal de Grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to Vendin leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the	65.43716430664062
3892/28840	All the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments	128.10704040527344
3893/28840	It was seven oclock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed	24.077451705932617
3894/28840	As he had foreseen Lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raouls	50.803123474121094
3895/28840	The event was announced by the cessation of the	103.91183471679688
3896/28840	As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detach	215.486572265625
3897/28840	Orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet	402.5415954589844
3898/28840	At nine oclock the night had fully	80.05693817138672
3899/28840	Still a last ray of twilight lighted the	122.39323425292969
3900/28840	The army marched silently the prince at the head of the	128.2972869873047
3901/28840	Presently the army came in sight of Lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by	119.55412292480469
3902/28840	The prince assigned to every one his	256.37896728515625
3903/28840	Marshal de Grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on Meric	176.06698608398438
3904/28840	The Duc de Chatillon commanded the	80.57510375976562
3905/28840	Finally the prince led the right wing resting on Aun	188.4239959716797
3906/28840	The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the	62.72320556640625
3907/28840	Each one on awaking would find himself on the field of	64.54977416992188
3908/28840	The movement was executed in silence and with	300.02734375
3909/28840	At ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at halfpast ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following	61.98956298828125
3910/28840	The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept Bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded	51.24061965942383
3911/28840	A tent was erected for them near that of the marsh	159.38259887695312
3912/28840	Although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to	47.39706802368164
3913/28840	And besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible	74.51258087158203
3914/28840	On the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become	114.7905044555664
3915/28840	It need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is	120.70479583740234
3916/28840	Some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to	59.82040023803711
3917/28840	The letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written	401.6500244140625
3918/28840	The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and	183.78912353515625
3919/28840	The letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their	137.04803466796875
3920/28840	In case any evil should happen to me said Bragel	52.035308837890625
3921/28840	In case I should be killed said De Gu	37.11088180541992
3922/28840	They then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and	120.59991455078125
3923/28840	The second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the	68.0331802368164
3924/28840	The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday at eight oclock in the evening	42.449459075927734
3925/28840	On that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or	73.89247131347656
3926/28840	The first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of	62.5186653137207
3927/28840	Athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of	265.0528564453125
3928/28840	At this order given in Athoss habitually calm manner the face of the Gascon relaxed and Porthoss brow grew	84.67758178710938
3929/28840	He knew that Athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to	47.004859924316406
3930/28840	This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former	80.36092376708984
3931/28840	In a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their	75.2528076171875
3932/28840	Now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the	218.27662658691406
3933/28840	Soonstrange factAramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which Porthos unfastened his	97.81382751464844
3934/28840	Battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great	131.05355834960938
3935/28840	A great prince said Aramis with whom Mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with	57.498085021972656
3936/28840	The prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent	87.08304595947266
3937/28840	In this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce	81.6883316040039
3938/28840	What did Mazarin do   Stormed suggested Ath	90.6946792602539
3939/28840	You have guessed it answered Aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were	98.74833679199219
3940/28840	At last their hilarity calmed down and   Faith exclaimed DArtagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to Mazarin for I assure you on his side he wishes you no	55.90842056274414
3941/28840	If I thought the fellow knew me by my name I would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought I knew	61.05318069458008
3942/28840	He knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them I can answer for	42.445518493652344
3943/28840	By whom   By me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any	39.63994216918945
3944/28840	And what did you reply   That I had none as yet but that I was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me	43.53372573852539
3945/28840	You told him that said Porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest	85.50802612304688
3946/28840	Bravo and you are not afraid of that Athos   No replied Athos it is not the search of Mazarin that I	29.27985382080078
3947/28840	Now said Aramis tell me a little what you do	81.18395233154297
3948/28840	Nothing for the present at least nothing in good	107.59891510009766
3949/28840	And with regard to the past asked Porth	41.916839599609375
3950/28840	Oh the past is another thing said Athos sighing the past and the	64.29560089111328
3951/28840	Are you afraid for your young Raoul asked Aram	44.85197448730469
3952/28840	Well said DArtagnan one is never killed in a first	52.61491394042969
3953/28840	Well I shall look upon it as an exp	52.90190505981445
3954/28840	Ah said DArtagnan I know what you	10.03842830657959
3955/28840	And I too added Aramis but you must not think of that Athos what is past is	81.06797790527344
3956/28840	The affair at Armentieres asked he	84.86469268798828
3957/28840	Oh yes said Porthos true I had forgotten it   Athos looked at him int	27.507917404174805
3958/28840	You have forgotten it Porthos said	42.49000930786133
3959/28840	Faith yes it is so long ago answered Porth	43.32338333129883
3960/28840	This affair does not then weigh upon your conscience   Faith	75.38479614257812
3961/28840	And you DArtagnan   II own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancie	52.79924392700195
3962/28840	Yes yes murmured he I have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the	87.5674819946289
3963/28840	Consider said Aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of	66.60391998291016
3964/28840	We were but the instruments that is	155.3839874267578
3965/28840	But as to free will Aramis   How acts the judge He has a free will yet he fearlessly	170.45797729492188
3966/28840	What does the executioner He is master of his arm yet he strikes without	171.3279266357422
3967/28840	The executioner muttered Athos as if arrested by some	133.7839813232422
3968/28840	As for me said Porthos now that you have reminded me of it Athos I have the scene again before me as if I now were	43.97745132446289
3969/28840	Milady was there as it were where you	315.4505920410156
3970/28840	I wore a long sword which cut like a Damascusyou remember it Aramis for you always called it Balizard	96.11575317382812
3971/28840	Upon my honor and by the holy cross I only regret it because she was a	80.58025360107422
3972/28840	The most satisfactory part of the matter said DArtagnan is that there remains no trace of	27.088220596313477
3973/28840	Then said Athos woe to De Winter for the child had done no	56.129459381103516
3974/28840	May the devil take me if the child be not dead said Porth	64.37831115722656
3975/28840	There is so much fog in that detestable country at least so DArtagnan	40.29328536987305
3976/28840	Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the	74.19940185546875
3977/28840	Please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of	66.8773193359375
3978/28840	To which of us asked all the four	138.09835815429688
3979/28840	To him who is called the Comte de la F	12.301283836364746
3980/28840	It is I said Athos and what is the name of the person   Grim	17.837501525878906
3981/28840	Back already What can have happened then to Bragelonne   Let him enter cried DArtagnan let him come	28.020845413208008
3982/28840	But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave	44.83877182006836
3983/28840	The door being closed the four friends waited in	182.47264099121094
3984/28840	Grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible	125.32073974609375
3985/28840	Your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon youbeware   Athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy	87.5497817993164
3986/28840	Porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall Aramis seized his knife DArtagnan	37.26677322387695
3987/28840	What do you mean Grimaud he	32.723106384277344
3988/28840	That Miladys son has left England that he is in France on his road to Paris if he be not here	87.84416961669922
3989/28840	Are you sure of it   Certain replied Grim	27.23519515991211
3990/28840	Grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a	101.78787231445312
3991/28840	Athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to	121.24120330810547
3992/28840	Well after all said DArtagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to Paris we have seen many other	43.146644592285156
3993/28840	Yes echoed Porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him	48.67873001098633
3994/28840	Moreover he is but a child said Aram	35.484840393066406
3995/28840	Do you know what he has done this child Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of Bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his	51.462188720703125
3996/28840	See it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the	116.92450714111328
3997/28840	And Grimaud threw the dagger on the	50.28675842285156
3998/28840	DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their	20.507537841796875
3999/28840	Athos alone remained seated calm and	616.2643432617188
4000/28840	And you say he is dressed as a monk Grimaud   Yes as an Augustine	58.03388214111328
4001/28840	What sized man is he   About my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen	98.03572082519531
4002/28840	And he did not see Raoul asked Ath	33.14775085449219
4003/28840	Yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying	32.96295928955078
4004/28840	Athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his	107.7196044921875
4005/28840	And very soon they left the	225.23306274414062

4137/28840	But this relation you mentioneddo you wish me to speak to him said Mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwells	44.734622955322266

4143/28840	After reading the first lines of the letter Mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he	36.87556838989258
4144/28840	Observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying   Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time Let us see what this letter	67.8442153930664
4145/28840	We here present the letter verbatim   To his Eminence Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini   I have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in	55.254669189453125
4146/28840	The two kingdoms are so near that France must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of	74.87872314453125
4147/28840	The English are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of Charles and his	192.3749237060547
4148/28840	Placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable	94.77606964111328
4149/28840	I am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King	69.94110107421875
4150/28840	I shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are with	65.12053680419922
4151/28840	This battle won by me the king will have no further resources in England or in Scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and	95.52268981933594
4152/28840	France has already received Queen Henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my	94.92930603027344
4153/28840	But Madame Henrietta is a daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of	33.60710906982422
4154/28840	As to King Charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him France will censure the acts of the English nation and thus so essentially harm England and especially the wellbeing of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced	148.18560791015625
4155/28840	At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young	66.40584564208984
4156/28840	Mazarin resumed his reading   It is important therefore monseigneur that I should be informed as to the intentions of	92.59603881835938
4157/28840	The interests of that kingdom and those of England though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the	136.32269287109375

4160/28840	I have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government of	58.50651168823242
4161/28840	That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles from the territory of France and in refraining from helping hima stranger to your countrywith arms with money or with	205.93438720703125
4162/28840	My letter is private and confidential and for that reason I send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsel	84.43832397460938
4163/28840	It anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the	79.81094360351562

4167/28840	That is not all sir continued Mazarin your private adventures have touched me to the quick besides the letter from	117.40011596679688
4168/28840	Mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to	58.75210952758789

4184/28840	You are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in England added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done	70.81723022460938
4185/28840	I am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like	69.35665893554688
4186/28840	Well then your eminence said the queen I must inform you that Charles	32.17607498168945

4190/28840	Oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another	65.86283874511719
4191/28840	Peccato said Mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless I explain myself in	92.60072326660156

4194/28840	The perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarins	68.19518280029297
4195/28840	That admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned Mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king Charles	96.04643249511719

4205/28840	Oh madame said Mazarin your majesty knows not what you	34.427127838134766
4206/28840	On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own	57.122493743896484
4207/28840	To the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor If he comes to France will you accord him hospitality What do you intend to do	95.56342315673828
4208/28840	Madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech I shall convince your majesty I trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at	54.98775863647461
4209/28840	After which your majesty will I think no longer doubt my zeal in your	76.23817443847656
4210/28840	The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her	114.96365356445312
4211/28840	Well what do you propose to do she said at length come	122.61357116699219
4212/28840	I will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to	95.452392578125
4213/28840	With which you are at waris it not so You will charge Broussel to report	145.6461639404297
4214/28840	I understand you or rather I am	47.32715606689453

4217/28840	It signifies little said Mazarin when he was	124.88681030273438
4218/28840	It gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but I have said nothing either to the one or to the	75.3568344116211
4219/28840	See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the	63.88575744628906
4220/28840	Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges who was on	64.25331115722656
4221/28840	Your eminence said Comminges as I was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by Raphael which is opposite the	73.08137512207031
4222/28840	He reflected for a second and then descended the	84.19145965576172
4223/28840	I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace	126.15918731689453
4224/28840	But is not your eminence going to the queen   For what purpose   Monsieur de Guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the	24.345989227294922
4225/28840	Comminges had seen rightly and Mordaunt had really acted as he had	134.2283935546875
4226/28840	In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived De Winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her	72.25878143310547
4227/28840	At this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of Raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible	100.87663269042969
4228/28840	His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his	79.01980590820312
4229/28840	He had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to	56.946372985839844
4230/28840	At last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and De Winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her	67.72701263427734
4231/28840	The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre which they	44.57365036010742

4233/28840	How sometimes the Unhappy mistake Chance for	556.548095703125
4234/28840	Well madame said De Winter when the queen had dismissed her	51.7872428894043
4235/28840	Well my lord what I foresaw has come to	72.22178649902344
4236/28840	What does the cardinal refuse to receive the king France refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince Ay but it is for the first time madame   I did not say France my lord I said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a	54.66822814941406
4237/28840	But did you see the queen   It is useless replied Henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says	49.66068649291992
4238/28840	Are you not aware that this Italian directs everything both indoors and out And moreover I should not be surprised had we been forestalled by Crom	84.15718841552734
4239/28840	He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to	162.4324188232422
4240/28840	Then did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal the passing to and fro of busy people Can they have received any news my lord   Not from England mad	68.04096221923828
4241/28840	I made such haste that I am certain of not having been forest	46.02540969848633
4242/28840	I set out three days ago passing miraculously through the Puritan army and I took post horses with my servant Tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in	113.1305923461914
4243/28840	Besides the king I am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking	130.85548400878906
4244/28840	I shall go and die by his	65.85612487792969
4245/28840	Madame madame exclaimed De Winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some	97.47161865234375
4246/28840	What can be done with four   Four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom I speak performed great things at one	98.39413452148438
4247/28840	And where are these four men   Ah that is what I do not	22.949443817138672
4248/28840	It is twenty years since I saw them and yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of	38.974517822265625
4249/28840	And these men were your friends   One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to	48.386940002441406
4250/28840	I know not whether he is still my friend but since that time I have remained	54.284183502197266
4251/28840	And these men are in France my lord   I believe	38.99546813964844
4252/28840	Tell me their names perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding	116.21297454833984
4253/28840	One of them was called the Chevalier dArtagn	14.816351890563965
4254/28840	Ah my lord if I mistake not the Chevalier dArtagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for I fear that this man is entirely devoted to the	25.599016189575195
4255/28840	That would be a misfortune said De Winter and I shall begin to think that we are really	39.702064514160156
4256/28840	But the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his	54.03242874145508
4257/28840	The others my lord   The secondI heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the Comte de la F	60.375999450683594
4258/28840	As for the two others I had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their real	44.37937545776367
4259/28840	Oh mon Dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the	41.95175552368164
4260/28840	Oh yes said De Winter for they are the same	59.44270706176758
4261/28840	Have you never heard that Queen Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen   Yes at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and	71.5645523071289
4262/28840	Well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor I tell you you must not count on Monsieur dArtagn	42.15030288696289
4263/28840	Seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to England I will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave White	109.50065612792969
4264/28840	Seek them my lord and find them I conjure	131.7077178955078
4265/28840	I will search for them madame said De Winter and doubtless I shall find them but time fails	52.30664825439453
4266/28840	Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony   Then indeed we are lost cried the queen in the fullness of a broken	88.83655548095703
4267/28840	At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the	63.67790603637695
4268/28840	But that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young	49.57364273071289
4269/28840	She stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen   Why then do you always weep mother when I am away from you she	79.1680679321289
4270/28840	The queen smiled but instead of answering   See De Winter she said I have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of mad	81.82209014892578
4271/28840	Then turning toward her daughter   What do you want Henrietta she	42.21223831176758
4272/28840	I saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the Viscount de Bragel	20.980955123901367
4273/28840	The queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and Raoul appeared on the	38.00884246826172
4274/28840	Advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt	44.76310348510742
4275/28840	Madame said he I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the Count de Guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his	41.398956298828125
4276/28840	At the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of	26.83379554748535
4277/28840	You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont Henrietta said the	20.705785751342773
4278/28840	I thought so madame stammered the young	32.13710403442383
4279/28840	It is my fault madame said Ra	36.268558502197266
4280/28840	I did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche acted as his	51.466941833496094
4281/28840	There has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to Raoul to	61.25918197631836
4282/28840	At this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her	96.01496887207031
4283/28840	No madame replied Raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of	32.82008361816406
4284/28840	The young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their	98.53206634521484
4285/28840	Let us see said the queen what the count	80.84060668945312
4286/28840	If her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of	58.46844482421875
4287/28840	I have the honor to be with respect	52.61299133300781
4288/28840	The battle of Lens gained said the queen they are lucky here indeed they can gain battles Yes the Marechal de Grammont is right this will change the aspect of French affairs but I much fear it will do nothing for English even if it does not harm	83.89746856689453
4289/28840	This is recent news sir continued she and I thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter I should not have heard till tomorrow perhaps after tomorrowthe last of all	66.37351989746094
4290/28840	Madame said Raoul the Louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and I had sworn to the Count de Guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even I should embrace my	64.19699096679688
4291/28840	Your guardian is he too a Bragelonne asked Lord de	64.59648132324219

4293/28840	And your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name   The Comte de la Fere madame replied the young man b	23.572561264038086
4294/28840	De Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of	33.788028717041016
4295/28840	The Comte de la Fere she	12.47227954864502
4296/28840	Have you not mentioned that name to me   As for De Winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard ar	29.23033332824707
4297/28840	The Comte de la Fere he cried in his	9.842591285705566
4298/28840	Oh sir reply I entreat youis not the Comte de la Fere a noble whom I remember handsome and brave a musketeer under Louis	52.59642791748047
4299/28840	who must be now about fortyseven or fortyeight years of age   Yes sir you are right in every particular   And who served under an assumed name   Under the name of Ath	28.607376098632812
4300/28840	Latterly I heard his friend Monsieur dArtagnan give him that	42.09956359863281
4301/28840	That is it madame that is the	25.76225471496582
4302/28840	God be praised And he is in Paris continued he addressing Raoul then turning to the queen We may still	52.37525939941406
4303/28840	Providence has declared for us since I have found this brave man again in so miraculous a	233.8350830078125
4304/28840	And sir where does he reside pray   The Comte de la Fere lodges in the Rue Guenegaud Hotel du Grand Roi Charlem	11.40537166595459
4305/28840	Inform this dear friend that he may remain within that I shall go and see him	135.35336303710938
4306/28840	Sir I obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to	86.95690155029297
4307/28840	Go Monsieur de Bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our	17.544225692749023
4308/28840	Raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to De Winter	103.32244110107422
4309/28840	The queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own	62.64229202270508
4310/28840	Then when De Winter rose to take leave   Listen my lord said the queen I have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of	69.41849517822266
4311/28840	They are worth about fifty thousand	117.23200988769531
4312/28840	I had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be	87.36695098876953
4313/28840	Take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my	179.2662811279297
4314/28840	Madame replied De Winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to	33.9005126953125
4315/28840	I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we	125.11474609375
4316/28840	In an hour hence I shall be with the Comte de la Fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite	23.73540496826172
4317/28840	The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the Lou	65.9511489868164
4318/28840	It was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little	45.729896545410156
4319/28840	In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar	55.74475860595703
4320/28840	Tony he said motioning to his groom to	117.75550842285156
4321/28840	Did you remark that man who is following us   Yes my	42.37980270385742
4322/28840	Who is he   I do not know only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal stopped at the Louvre to wait for you and now leaves the Louvre with	37.64916229248047
4323/28840	Some spy of the cardinal said De Winter to him	105.04376220703125
4324/28840	Let us pretend not to notice that he is watching	111.84548950195312
4325/28840	And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the Marais for having for so long a time lived near the Place Royale Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient	88.53453826904297
4326/28840	The unknown spurred his horse to a gall	86.13624572753906
4327/28840	De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the	46.20346450805664
4328/28840	He turned around and Mordaunt stood before	42.514015197753906
4329/28840	There was a moment of frozen silence between these	127.11434936523438
4330/28840	Sir said De Winter I thought I had already made you aware that I am weary of this persecution withdraw then or I shall call and have you turned out as you were in	58.30354690551758
4331/28840	I am not your uncle I know you	39.25608444213867
4332/28840	My uncle replied Mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in Londonyou dare	85.19525909423828
4333/28840	As for denying that I am your nephew you will think twice about it now that I have learned some things of which I was ignorant a year	85.88175964355469
4334/28840	And how does it concern me what you have learned said De	47.10823440551758
4335/28840	Oh it concerns you very closely my uncle I am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus	57.5933837890625
4336/28840	Yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter and crossing his	45.91781234741211
4337/28840	I have asked the headsman of Bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and	54.251007080078125
4338/28840	And the headsman of Bethune gave me a	44.443355560302734
4339/28840	De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a	52.14107131958008
4340/28840	Yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key I open the	73.62601470947266
4341/28840	My mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it you have despoiled me of my	75.04107666015625
4342/28840	I am no longer astonished that you knew me	32.770591735839844
4343/28840	I am not surprised that you refused to recognize	33.163299560546875

4345/28840	These words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had	138.21522521972656
4346/28840	De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young	90.43907165527344
4347/28840	You desire to fathom this horrible secret said De Winter well then so be	133.66748046875
4348/28840	Know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to	131.26138305664062
4349/28840	That woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my	57.375328063964844
4350/28840	What say you to that   I say that she was my	31.31635284423828
4351/28840	She caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and	91.88045501708984
4352/28840	What say you to that crime of which I have the proof   She was my	64.5971908569336
4353/28840	On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Beth	48.19941711425781
4354/28840	Will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this I have the proofs   She was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing	73.40768432617188
4355/28840	Depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by Heaven and	110.55467987060547
4356/28840	But this I know that I had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murdered her clandestinely by nightsilentlylike cow	161.35780334472656
4357/28840	I know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others She must	78.19261932373047
4358/28840	The latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death   Would you assassinate me sir Then I shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a	36.731964111328125
4359/28840	No replied Mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no I shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you I could not discover the	76.5489730834961
4360/28840	But when I have found them then tremble	79.64757537841797
4361/28840	I stabbed to the heart the headsman of Bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you	58.42527389526367
4362/28840	With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his	90.50369262695312
4363/28840	But De Winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying   My God I thank Thee that he knows me	74.08407592773438
4364/28840	Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious	92.42012786865234
4365/28840	He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the	65.01715087890625
4366/28840	It almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to	218.23696899414062
4367/28840	Athos was happyhappy as he had never been	155.4294891357422
4368/28840	And you assisted and took part in this great battle Bragelonne cried the former musket	86.849365234375
4369/28840	And it was a fierce one   His highness the prince charged eleven times in	119.26042938232422
4370/28840	I did not lose sight of him for an	11.998218536376953
4371/28840	Oh how fine it is to be called Condé and to be so worthy of such a name   He was calm and radiant was he not   As calm as at parade radiant as at a fet	67.4314193725586
4372/28840	When we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the Spaniards who were on a height with lowered musk	91.34461975097656
4373/28840	When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers Comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those	91.70825958251953
4374/28840	There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword Sound trumpets he	123.77804565429688
4375/28840	Well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you Raoul   I know not sir but I thought it really very fine and grand   Were you afraid Raoul asked the	44.294212341308594
4376/28840	Yes sir replied the young man naively I felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in Spanish from the enemys ranks I closed my eyes and thought of	55.19179153442383
4377/28840	In honest truth Raoul said Athos pressing his	43.86545944213867
4378/28840	Yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had	48.75554275512695
4379/28840	Those who were not killed felt the heat of the	121.48314666748047
4380/28840	I opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or	158.19915771484375
4381/28840	At that moment I encountered the eye of the	102.10846710205078
4382/28840	I had but one thought and that was that he was observing	59.097904205322266
4383/28840	I spurred on and found myself in the enemys	34.58855438232422
4384/28840	And the prince was pleased with you   He told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to Paris with Monsieur de Chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had	36.19942855834961
4385/28840	Go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of your	58.36354064941406
4386/28840	Go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made me of	68.30984497070312
4387/28840	And I came sir added Raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for I thought you would be glad to see me	31.937339782714844
4388/28840	Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young	44.260536193847656
4389/28840	What is his name   I did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although I thought from his accent he was an English	39.77688217163086
4390/28840	Ah said Athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could	31.867652893066406
4391/28840	Then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate	29.685518264770508
4392/28840	Yes truly dear friend and I may even say the sight of you increases my	74.84188079833984
4393/28840	And De Winter glancing around him Raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffected	46.66742706298828
4394/28840	Come now that we are alone said Athos let us talk of	34.822265625
4395/28840	Whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied De	85.09931945800781
4396/28840	Does Grimaud know him then   No but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew	33.064674377441406
4397/28840	The headsman of Bethune exclaimed De	35.273746490478516
4398/28840	You know about that cried Athos	98.00487518310547
4399/28840	He has just left me replied De Winter after telling me	48.13923645019531
4400/28840	De Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his	77.8794937133789
4401/28840	Do you not know the race said	93.22065734863281
4402/28840	Pooh said Athos trying to smile in his	33.95455551147461
4403/28840	It must have lost its ferocity in the second	62.8388786315918
4404/28840	Besides my friend Providence has warned us that we may be on our	75.1963882446289
4405/28840	All we can now do is to	177.9777069091797
4406/28840	Let us wait and as I said before let us speak of	82.30362701416016
4407/28840	What brings you to Paris   Affairs of importance which you shall know	82.46858978271484
4408/28840	But what is this that I hear from Her Majesty the Queen of England Monsieur dArtagnan sides with Mazarin Pardon my frankness dear	35.83823013305664
4409/28840	I neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by	165.3543701171875
4410/28840	But do you happen to belong to him   Monsieur dArtagnan replied Athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional	23.898717880249023
4411/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to	38.27647399902344
4412/28840	Millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in	553.6610717773438
4413/28840	Alas said De Winter I am at this moment as poor as he is if not	47.46981430053711
4414/28840	Well then you wish to know if I am of Mazarins party	55.414329528808594
4415/28840	I am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence You make me young and happy again by	121.94356536865234
4416/28840	Ah so you are not a Mazarinist Delightful Indeed you could not belong to	45.530784606933594
4417/28840	But pardon me are you free I mean to ask if you are married   Ah as to that no replied Athos	47.692649841308594
4418/28840	Because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished   Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his	95.41535186767578
4419/28840	Very well you are always the same Athos great and	212.98155212402344
4420/28840	Are you still friends with Monsieur Porthos and Monsieur Aramis   Add Monsieur dArtagnan my	11.423158645629883
4421/28840	We still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being Mazarinists or Frondists then we are only	73.0695571899414
4422/28840	Is Monsieur Aramis with DArtagnan asked Lord de	15.24338150024414
4423/28840	No said Athos Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my	34.23928451538086
4424/28840	Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend Is he much changed   He has become an abbé that is	50.85895538330078
4425/28840	You alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undert	94.07862091064453
4426/28840	On the contrary said Athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable	29.544198989868164
4427/28840	Could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the Pont du Louvre   Oh oh exclaimed Athos smiling you have a duel in	28.387128829956055
4428/28840	Yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which I hope you will take your	65.85504913330078
4429/28840	Where are we to go my lord   To Her Majesty the Queen of England who has desired me to present you to	29.597965240478516
4430/28840	This is an enigma said Athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it I ask no	45.83954620361328
4431/28840	Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me   Thanks count no replied De	36.68107223510742
4432/28840	I own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my	112.25025939941406
4433/28840	What undertaking can have brought him to Paris It was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my	63.358551025390625
4434/28840	This young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predis	48.866493225097656
4435/28840	What occupies him in England   He is one of Cromwells most enthusiastic	51.19414138793945
4436/28840	But what attached him to the cause His father and mother were Catholics I believe   His hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of De	61.22349548339844
4437/28840	And what name does he now bear   Mord	75.55007934570312
4438/28840	A Puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in	244.50216674804688
4439/28840	Do you say as a monk   It was thus and by mere accidentmay God pardon me if I blasphemethat he heard the confession of the executioner of Beth	35.96461486816406
4440/28840	Then I understand it all he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forest	48.17779541015625
4441/28840	But the night is dark said Athos perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no	67.52759552001953
4442/28840	I have Tony a safe if simple	621.2109375
4443/28840	Halloo there Grimaud Olivain and Blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with	84.96661376953125
4444/28840	Blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne whom Athos had christened by the name of his	49.541351318359375
4445/28840	Viscount said Athos to Raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach	55.63872528076172
4446/28840	Oh count said De Winter for whom do you take me   For a stranger who does not know Paris said Athos and to whom the viscount will show the	33.71701431274414
4447/28840	De Winter shook him by the	97.5537338256836
4448/28840	Grimaud said Athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the	72.42961120605469
4449/28840	Grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloqu	118.43756103515625
4450/28840	The same order was followed in returning nor did Grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the Qu	54.25300216674805
4451/28840	He fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his	64.54349517822266
4452/28840	He pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue	123.55945587158203
4453/28840	The next day on awaking the count perceived Raoul by his bed	49.26179885864258
4454/28840	The young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by	108.22642517089844
4455/28840	Yes sir replied Raoul with slight hesitation I did not sleep	34.30609130859375
4456/28840	You Raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said Ath	50.92017364501953
4457/28840	Where then said Athos smiling if it be not a	38.99291229248047
4458/28840	You are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting	85.63060760498047
4459/28840	Never sir said Raoul as long as I possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to	57.845298767089844
4460/28840	I have however a wish to go and pass a day at Bl	76.68695831298828
4461/28840	You look at me and you are going to laugh at	25.75516128540039
4462/28840	No on the contrary I am not inclined to laugh said Athos suppressing a	30.215585708618164
4463/28840	You wish to see Blois again it is but	76.06029510498047
4464/28840	Then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed Raoul joy	68.50343322753906
4465/28840	Certainly and why should I regret what gives you pleasure   Oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and I can set out immediately   When you like Ra	39.208248138427734
4466/28840	Sir said Raoul as he turned to leave the room I have thought of one thing and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my introduction to the	29.52304458618164
4467/28840	And you ought to thank her Ra	115.6045150756836
4468/28840	Well try the Hotel de Luynes Raoul and ask if the duchess can receive	57.707576751708984
4469/28840	I am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the	47.8311767578125
4470/28840	Raoul went out and when Athos heard his young joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain he	85.80484771728516
4471/28840	It is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common	151.27476501464844
4472/28840	Nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not	396.7233581542969
4473/28840	Everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as Athos was watching Raoul mount a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevre	49.8126220703125
4474/28840	He was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her	40.423011779785156
4475/28840	Tell her grace replied Athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Lu	47.53787612915039
4476/28840	Then with renewed instructions to Grimaud Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that	49.49945068359375
4477/28840	Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois the only servingman whom he had	70.24092864990234
4478/28840	Blaisois found Bazin donning his beadles gown his services being required that day at Notre	160.24151611328125
4479/28840	Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis	82.55915832519531
4480/28840	Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and Christian	94.00494384765625
4481/28840	From the Comte de la Fere said Aram	7.640454292297363
4482/28840	And he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much	81.25020599365234
4483/28840	Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his	56.58538818359375
4484/28840	And you did not tell him that you came from me   No	22.85112190246582
4485/28840	At ten oclock Athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de	30.479299545288086
4486/28840	They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was not coming to join	101.36981201171875
4487/28840	Patience said Athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the Rue du Bac patience I see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be Aram	33.79644775390625
4488/28840	Having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him Aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten p	64.13567352294922
4489/28840	At this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious	54.76948928833008
4490/28840	A most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and Lord de	82.33660125732422
4491/28840	Where are we going inquired Aramis are we going to fight perchance I carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to procure	78.12437438964844
4492/28840	No said Lord de Winter we are going to pay a visit to Her Majesty the Queen of	19.963327407836914
4493/28840	Oh very well replied Aramis then bending his face down to Athoss ear what is the object of this visit continued	80.9390869140625
4494/28840	Nay I know not some evidence required from us	317.7951354980469
4495/28840	May it not be about that cursed affair asked Aramis in which case I do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them	76.35812377929688
4496/28840	If it were so answered Athos we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter for he would come in for his share he was one of	44.84727096557617
4497/28840	On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the	57.707820892333984

4499/28840	Mazarin is almost king answered Athos Madame Henrietta is almost no longer	224.89501953125
4500/28840	If you would condescend to be clever Athos observed Aramis I really do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur de Vo	51.96649932861328
4501/28840	The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Mis	65.00800323486328
4502/28840	The gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated	124.82722473144531
4503/28840	Athos was calm and grave but Aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented	92.14673614501953
4504/28840	You are examining the luxury I enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around	112.25325012207031
4505/28840	Madame replied Aramis I must ask your pardon but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry	49.75541687011719
4506/28840	is treated at the court of	74.8765869140625
4507/28840	Monsieur Aramis is not an officer asked the queen of Lord de	41.557884216308594
4508/28840	That gentleman is the Abbé dHerblay replied	17.65550994873047
4509/28840	Madame he said I am an abbé it is true but I am so against my	38.23282241821289
4510/28840	I never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and I am always ready to become a musketeer once	48.66419219970703
4511/28840	This morning being ignorant that I should have the honor of seeing your majesty I encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majestys service in whatever way you may see fit to use	58.05261993408203
4512/28840	The Abbé dHerblay resumed De Winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis	23.978565216064453
4513/28840	of whom I have spoken to you mad	22.521760940551758
4514/28840	Then turning to Athos he continued And this gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere whose high reputation is so well known to your	26.770219802856445
4515/28840	Gentlemen said the queen a few years ago I had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my	179.60606384277344
4516/28840	It is enough said Athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours mad	85.81696319580078
4517/28840	I am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of	107.7990951538086
4518/28840	Hold gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by Lord de	77.63004302978516
4519/28840	Obeying the queen Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded	65.57109832763672
4520/28840	Well asked Athos when he had closed the	43.236305236816406
4521/28840	Well said the queen it has been	67.17579650878906
4522/28840	The two friends exchanged a smile of	103.71357727050781
4523/28840	And now said Athos what is to be done I have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire Monsieur dHerblay and myself to do in your	23.018484115600586
4524/28840	Ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said Did I not answer for them   But you sir said the queen to Aram	34.3884391784668
4525/28840	Well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for	54.065223693847656
4526/28840	The king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the Scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a Scotch	144.41285705566406
4527/28840	Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted sir	94.86812591552734
4528/28840	I ask much too much perhaps for I have no title to request	63.22747802734375
4529/28840	Go to England join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every	118.77191925048828
4530/28840	And in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen I promisenot to reward you I believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every	102.68187713623047
4531/28840	And the queen raised her eyes solemnly	127.670166015625
4532/28840	Madame said Athos when must we set out   You consent then exclaimed the queen joy	56.89968490600586
4533/28840	Yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our	61.115196228027344
4534/28840	We render service to God madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so	212.791015625
4535/28840	Madame we are yours body and	609.473388671875
4536/28840	Oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or	93.21243286132812
4537/28840	Have you anything to ask of me From this moment I become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in	76.45110321044922
4538/28840	Madame replied Athos I have only to ask your majestys	20.63326072692871
4539/28840	And I said Aramis I am alone in the world and have only your majesty to	39.64110565185547
4540/28840	The queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to De Winter   If you need money my lord separate the jewels I have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some	66.19522857666016
4541/28840	You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like	88.84770202636719
4542/28840	The queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the Princess Henri	276.6034240722656
4543/28840	She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they	56.99959182739258
4544/28840	At the foot of the staircase De Winter	97.83431243896484
4545/28840	Not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and I will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the Gate Saint	71.02693176269531
4546/28840	We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the	74.29630279541016
4547/28840	Once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the	81.50907897949219
4548/28840	The three gentlemen then shook hands Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore and Athos and Aramis remaining	46.96052551269531
4549/28840	Well said Aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count   Bad replied Athos very	32.92134094238281
4550/28840	As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear DHerbl	38.41904830932617
4551/28840	Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy cannot survive without the countenance of monarch	120.60722351074219
4552/28840	Let us then support monarchy in order to support	147.21966552734375
4553/28840	We shall be murdered there said Aram	45.99185562133789
4554/28840	I hate the Englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills	257.0524597167969
4555/28840	Would it be better to remain here said Athos and take a turn in the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort Ifaith Aramis believe me there is little left to	43.551414489746094
4556/28840	We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is	254.28204345703125
4557/28840	And you   As for me I am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers I shall not find ten louis at	41.841468811035156
4558/28840	Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income	114.37056732177734
4559/28840	Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be	84.43707275390625
4560/28840	Now it is that I regret DArtagn	40.501953125
4561/28840	This secret Aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our	112.24217987060547
4562/28840	And moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of	127.11247253417969
4563/28840	Let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of	139.86973571777344
4564/28840	You are right but what are you going to do until this evening I have two things to	31.119384765625
4565/28840	And what are they   First a thrust with the coadjutor whom I met last night at Madame de Rambouillets and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting	65.97728729248047
4566/28840	This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our	92.79485321044922
4567/28840	I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of	51.14031982421875
4568/28840	And I my dear Aramis quietly replied Athos I think it would only change Monsieur de Retzs	42.46806335449219
4569/28840	Take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of	106.566162109375
4570/28840	So if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first   Oh that is of the first	88.64813232421875
4571/28840	Unfortunately it is a thing that I cant perform at any time I	51.9939079284668
4572/28840	It was arranged for the evening and no other time will	126.16989135742188
4573/28840	But my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return   Yes if I	70.98058319091797
4574/28840	If you do not return how does it concern you Be	109.2694320678711
4575/28840	Come you are no longer twenty years	24.535619735717773
4576/28840	To my great regret mordieu Ah if I were but twenty years old   Yes said Athos doubtless you would commit great follies But now we must	67.20348358154297
4577/28840	I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to	113.89688110351562
4578/28840	Call for me at eight oclock or shall I wait supper for you at seven   That will do very well said Aram	43.236698150634766
4579/28840	I have twenty visits to make and as many letters to	116.14921569824219
4580/28840	Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome left his name at Madame de Chevreuses and wrote the following letter to DArtagnan   Dear FriendI am about to set off with Aramis on important	38.12752914428711
4581/28840	I wished to make my adieux to you but time does not	50.53916549682617

4583/28840	At the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to	57.18596649169922
4584/28840	Bythebye he said I think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for Porthos and DArtagn	39.0584831237793
4585/28840	The thing is done dear friend said Athos I foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and	54.242305755615234
4586/28840	You are a wonderful man my dear count said Aramis you think of	30.486909866333008
4587/28840	Well have you made up your mind to this journey   Quite and now that I reflect about it I am glad to leave Paris at this	37.057044982910156
4588/28840	And so am I replied Athos my only regret is not having seen DArtagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our	48.191566467285156
4589/28840	Sir said he here is Monsieur dArtagnans	16.741168975830078
4590/28840	But I did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said Ath	43.87260055541992
4591/28840	And I set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden j	99.8798599243164
4592/28840	Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms   My dear CountWhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of	90.90016174316406
4593/28840	Now recalling former times of mutual distress I send you half my purse it is money to obtain which I made Mazarin	221.28602600097656
4594/28840	Dont make a bad use of it I entreat	35.62786102294922

4597/28840	Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are equally for Aramis as for youfor you as Aram	131.9034881591797
4598/28840	Athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a	103.0058822631836

4609/28840	The two friends mounted as did their	394.68365478515625
4610/28840	At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin who was running breath	56.9270133972168
4611/28840	Oh sir exclaimed he thank Heaven I have arrived in	134.02743530273438
4612/28840	Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you	53.972068786621094
4613/28840	Good said Aramis taking a purse which Bazin presented to	60.23541259765625
4614/28840	What is this   Wait your reverence there is a	47.501983642578125
4615/28840	You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier I will break every bone in your	31.126483917236328
4616/28840	How can you read asked Athos it is as dark as a cold	64.51641845703125
4617/28840	Wait said Bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted waxlight with which he started the church	127.96284484863281
4618/28840	Here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity	49.85036849975586
4619/28840	Do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if I want money I can send for some to any of my chateaux at Bracieux alone I have twenty thousand francs in	58.1103401184082
4620/28840	So if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a larger	52.92958450317383
4621/28840	I address you because you know that although I esteem him from my heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere but it is understood that what I offer you I offer him at the same	26.5492000579834
4622/28840	I am as I trust you do not doubt your devoted   Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierref	14.979708671569824
4623/28840	The division being made by the light of Bazins taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De Winter at the Porte Saint	34.78368377685547
4624/28840	In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the	76.00843811035156
4625/28840	The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their	44.81068420410156
4626/28840	It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the	175.78529357910156
4627/28840	At last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent	124.17424774169922
4628/28840	Boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then	158.80833435058594
4629/28840	Gentlemen said De Winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at Parislet us separate to avoid	129.8429718017578
4630/28840	I know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to	72.35942840576172
4631/28840	I will go there where I expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to LEpee du Grand Henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us	83.1637191772461
4632/28840	The matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern	167.20980834960938
4633/28840	Their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any	82.20999908447266
4634/28840	It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to Grim	65.13528442382812
4635/28840	Athos and Aramis walked down toward the	52.60737609863281
4636/28840	From their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promen	65.7800064086914
4637/28840	There was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided	154.08364868164062
4638/28840	This man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jet	73.59870147705078
4639/28840	From the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to	57.98580551147461
4640/28840	On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to	62.15047836303711
4641/28840	That is doubtless our boat said Ath	56.432151794433594
4642/28840	Yes replied Aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only De Winter does not keep us	106.58511352539062
4643/28840	It is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman	88.89745330810547
4644/28840	In truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of De Winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so	74.42617797851562
4645/28840	Gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but I see you come from Paris or at least that you are strangers at Boulog	72.81947326660156
4646/28840	He is and he is not replied Athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of France but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long	63.579933166503906
4647/28840	However sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison   No sir not at this moment at	39.45674514770508

4649/28840	What do you think of that interrogator asked Aram	33.691505432128906
4650/28840	I think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of	89.41999053955078
4651/28840	And you replied to him with that notion   Nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and I was so to	69.41471862792969
4652/28840	But if he be a spy   What do you think a spy would be about here We are not living in the time of Cardinal Richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare	53.32941818237305
4653/28840	It matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued Aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the	85.64436340332031
4654/28840	And you said Athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winters	38.004493713378906
4655/28840	Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped   More reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his	61.68055725097656
4656/28840	And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel   I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching	79.51145935058594
4657/28840	Besides let me own something to	168.0165557861328
4658/28840	I am anxious to see that young man	40.527435302734375
4659/28840	In ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a	82.42840576171875
4660/28840	Ah Egad cried Aramis you set me	102.39984893798828
4661/28840	I swear to you I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my	54.02964782714844
4662/28840	Ah here is De Winter coming said Ath	78.65707397460938
4663/28840	Good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us	97.8533935546875
4664/28840	I see them about twenty paces behind my	100.29253387451172
4665/28840	I recognize Grimaud by his long legs and his determined sl	172.43052673339844
4666/28840	Then we set sail tonight asked Aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be	85.06929779052734
4667/28840	Diable resumed Aramis I have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel I confess I prefer the convent of No	82.81449890136719
4668/28840	Athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward De	52.66934585571289
4669/28840	What ails our friend said Aramis he resembles one of Dantes damned whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their	92.76287078857422
4670/28840	What the devil makes him glower thus behind him   When De Winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapid	70.58837890625
4671/28840	What is the matter my lord said Athos and what puts you out of breath thus   Nothing replied De Winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned	45.00224304199219
4672/28840	But let us go continued De Winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchordo you see it there I wish I were on board already and he looked back	68.9098129272461
4673/28840	He has seen him said Athos in a low tone to Aram	14.624058723449707
4674/28840	They had reached the ladder which led to the	101.009765625
4675/28840	De Winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow	77.79270935058594
4676/28840	At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embark	35.07052993774414
4677/28840	He fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned	28.756122589111328
4678/28840	Athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young	60.553226470947266
4679/28840	The latter to make a short cut had appeared on a slu	339.36083984375
4680/28840	He certainly bodes us no good said Athos but let us embark once out at sea let him	98.411865234375
4681/28840	And Athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart row	65.60565948486328
4682/28840	But the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the	50.97626876831055
4683/28840	She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted	58.76968002319336
4684/28840	They saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it	68.22602081298828
4685/28840	Ay but said Aramis that young fellow is decidedly a	119.06025695800781
4686/28840	Which is the young man asked De Winter turning	46.35362243652344
4687/28840	He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold   De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramiss	93.15679931640625
4688/28840	The beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed	70.62238311767578
4689/28840	It is he exclaimed De Winter seizing the arm of Athos it is he I thought I recognized him and I was not	30.08561897277832
4690/28840	The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from	67.01966857910156
4691/28840	Yes it is I my uncleI the son of MiladyI the monkI the secretary and friend of CromwellI know you now both you and your	120.66981506347656
4692/28840	In that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their	339.0136413574219
4693/28840	As for Grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his	66.688232421875
4694/28840	Ah exclaimed Aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of Milady as he says	52.99019241333008
4695/28840	Then wait said Aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from Tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the	74.6466064453125
4696/28840	Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be	65.7335433959961
4697/28840	I had him so well at the point of my gun I should have sent a ball into his	65.8665771484375
4698/28840	It is enough to have killed the mother said Athos hoarse	51.129051208496094
4699/28840	The mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to	185.5462646484375
4700/28840	Yes but the son has done us no	71.23963928222656
4701/28840	Grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his	83.02867889404297
4702/28840	The young man burst into a	84.05179595947266
4703/28840	Ah it is certainly you he	96.05490112304688
4704/28840	His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the	125.93030548095703
4705/28840	Be calm exclaimed Athos for Heavens sake have we ceased to be men   No said Aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear	78.23550415039062
4706/28840	De Winter only replied by a gro	126.57560729980469
4707/28840	It was all up with him continued Aramis ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal	207.83912658691406
4708/28840	Athos took Lord de Winters hand and tried to turn the	87.51187896728516
4709/28840	When shall we land in England he asked but De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no	80.5110092163086
4710/28840	Hold Athos said Aramis perhaps there is yet	54.847740173339844
4711/28840	See if he is still in the same	25.913333892822266
4712/28840	Athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aure	79.5863037109375
4713/28840	Decidedly Aramis said Athos I think I was wrong not to let you	33.69300079345703
4714/28840	Hold your tongue replied Aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were	74.71348571777344
4715/28840	At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were	94.28215026855469
4716/28840	The captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards Hastings where they were to	95.87680053710938
4717/28840	At this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness	103.76002502441406
4718/28840	Then a voice reached them once more sending this threat To our next meeting sirs in	343.5904235839844
4719/28840	Te Deum for the Victory of	97.6309814453125
4720/28840	Such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with	308.7192687988281
4721/28840	The motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope of beating the	87.98448181152344
4722/28840	Now since the affair of Nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling Mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete	100.79109954833984
4723/28840	A council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided	98.28736114501953
4724/28840	It was only known that on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor of the victory of	69.5982666015625
4725/28840	The following Sunday then the Parisians arose with joy at that period a Te Deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great	97.48221588134766
4726/28840	The shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his	75.19947052001953
4727/28840	Moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te De	183.69668579101562
4728/28840	The police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous	191.12255859375
4729/28840	Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from Baz	74.55583190917969
4730/28840	In consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door and knocked	118.7684097290039
4731/28840	His mother the councillors old servant opened	519.9351196289062
4732/28840	And what hast thou to say boy to Monsieur Broussel   I wish to tell him replied Friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this	56.40097427368164
4733/28840	And as I hear everywhere that at the court they are illdisposed to him I wish to warn him that he may be on his	45.120670318603516
4734/28840	Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the	79.2189712524414
4735/28840	On the contrary my boy on the contrary I am pleased with your	52.2376823425293
4736/28840	Dame Nanette look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new	74.511474609375
4737/28840	Oh thank you sir thank you Monsieur Broussel said Friquet I am so fond of apricots   Broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine o	25.984067916870117
4738/28840	The councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around Notre	78.1654052734375
4739/28840	This noise redoubled when DArtagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the	35.562744140625
4740/28840	He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and Porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as DArtagnan had so often done	42.08488464355469
4741/28840	The sergeant of this company a veteran of the Spanish wars had recognized Porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Tré	69.09706115722656
4742/28840	Porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great	60.73439407348633
4743/28840	At last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded char	66.76863861083984
4744/28840	Ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the	87.25736999511719
4745/28840	God save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were	77.5794906616211
4746/28840	Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of Comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe now entirely	37.09337615966797
4747/28840	When it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix as if he was waiting for some	65.74115753173828
4748/28840	All the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been	74.61476135253906
4749/28840	Friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of Notre	73.12215423583984
4750/28840	Thence he saw the king the queen and Monsieur Mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on	45.523067474365234
4751/28840	Friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his	125.16600036621094
4752/28840	Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussels	55.136470794677734
4753/28840	Comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and Friquet was waiting behind Comminges until the door should be	42.48724365234375
4754/28840	What dost thou there rascal asked Comm	58.08454895019531
4755/28840	I want to go into Master Broussels house captain replied Friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of Paris know so well how to assume when	96.87850952148438
4756/28840	And on what floor does he live asked Comm	78.72892761230469
4757/28840	In the whole house said Friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is	78.3060073852539
4758/28840	At this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at	45.100257873535156
4759/28840	The worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to	81.8748550415039
4760/28840	At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed	116.50737762451172
4761/28840	Still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain	36.27206802368164
4762/28840	Sir said Comminges I am the bearer of an order from the	34.87213134765625
4763/28840	Very well sir replied Broussel what is this order And he held out his	55.37866973876953
4764/28840	I am commissioned to seize your person sir said Comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow	50.463287353515625
4765/28840	A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling	88.95392608642578
4766/28840	It was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the	50.10491943359375
4767/28840	Madame Broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their fathers	49.96409606933594
4768/28840	Come sir said Comminges make haste you must obey the	70.9156265258789
4769/28840	Sir said Broussel I am in bad health and cannot give myself up a prisoner in this state I must have	57.30424118041992
4770/28840	It is impossible said Comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this	138.87234497070312
4771/28840	Impossible said Louvieres sir beware of driving us to	116.47532653808594
4772/28840	Impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the	54.8216667175293
4773/28840	Comminges turned and saw Dame Nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her	48.482444763183594
4774/28840	My good Nanette be quiet I beseech you said Brous	50.59758758544922

4781/28840	They want to arrest Master Broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs   The crowd began to murmur and approached the	47.06300354003906
4782/28840	The two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented	37.34125900268555
4783/28840	Dont you see them cried Friquet dont you see there they are   The coachman turning around gave Friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with	51.37510681152344
4784/28840	Ah devils coachman cried Friquet youre meddling too Wait   And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands	86.40643310546875
4785/28840	The tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the	102.19268798828125
4786/28840	The soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the car	83.79456329345703
4787/28840	This gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with	77.34940338134766
4788/28840	During ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last Comminges appeared pushing Broussel before	88.92916107177734
4789/28840	Let us break the carriage cried the	184.65826416015625
4790/28840	The first who advances is a dead man cried Raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling	86.18488311767578
4791/28840	Comminges so to speak threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in after	164.42477416992188
4792/28840	At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the	46.4658088684082
4793/28840	Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second	47.68069076538086

4846/28840	They are bad managers said DArtagnan shrugging his	14.13674545288086
4847/28840	When a carriage is chosen it ought to be	138.7160186767578

4851/28840	So you suppose I have need of an escort	144.29983520507812
4852/28840	The musketeers set off and DArtagnan was left alone with Ra	18.284000396728516

4854/28840	Whats the matter with this head said DArtagnan raising the battered	69.95394134521484

4857/28840	Yes but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was taken	32.68327713012695
4858/28840	At this very moment Friquet passed mounted on Raouls horse waving his particolored cap and crying Broussel Broussel   Halloo stop rascal cried DArtagn	41.50284957885742
4859/28840	Friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his	120.9402084350586
4860/28840	DArtagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue Master Friquet but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking	38.520137786865234
4861/28840	Friquet had a quick eye and a fine	260.4816589355469
4862/28840	He saw DArtagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at	39.94690704345703
4863/28840	Ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward DArtagnan and I am truly pleased to meet	38.69144821166992
4864/28840	DArtagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little chorister of the Rue de la Cal	19.26268196105957
4865/28840	Ah tis thou rascal said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy thou hast become a horse stealer   Ah your honor how can you say so exclaimed Fri	99.73005676269531

4869/28840	Ten kicks on his back said DArtagnan be off you little villain and forget not that I have your	83.63768005371094
4870/28840	Friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine and	104.20016479492188
4871/28840	Raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiqueton	33.25042724609375
4872/28840	DArtagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own	26.317739486694336
4873/28840	They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chev	30.077272415161133
4874/28840	The handsome Madeleine announced to DArtagnan that Planchet had returned bringing Mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would	41.226871490478516
4875/28840	DArtagnan desired Planchet to be summoned but he had	24.371675491333008
4876/28840	You are much pleased with yourself said he to Raoul when they were alone are you not   Well yes replied Ra	32.68031311035156
4877/28840	It seems to me I did my	54.7342414855957
4878/28840	And who told you to defend the king   The Comte de la Fere	16.099388122558594
4879/28840	Yes the king but today you have not fought for the king you have fought for Mazarin which is not quite the same	39.93244171142578
4880/28840	But you yourself   Oh for me that is another	61.57969665527344
4881/28840	As for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no	113.69355010986328
4882/28840	But has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel Breathe not a word of that or the Comte de la Fere will be	56.352020263671875
4883/28840	You think the count will be angry with me   Think it Im certain of it were it not for that I should thank you for you have worked for	40.806854248046875
4884/28840	However I scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe	104.90805053710938
4885/28840	And moreover my dear child continued DArtagnan I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your	29.906591415405273
4886/28840	I do not understand you sir said Ra	11.830832481384277
4887/28840	DArtagnan rose and taking a letter from his writingdesk presented it to Ra	34.727962493896484
4888/28840	The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the	52.55769348144531
4889/28840	Oh mon Dieu he said raising his fine eyes to DArtagnan moist with tears the count has left Paris without seeing me   He left four days ago said DArtagn	25.340635299682617
4890/28840	But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps	134.21873474121094
4891/28840	Heheincur danger of death No be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere	319.4129333496094

4896/28840	Yes but in exchange said Porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange I have torn many	67.19396209716797
4897/28840	Those wretches wanted to take away my sword Deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but I knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of Balizard	105.70040893554688

4899/28840	Look here resumed DArtagnan here is Monsieur de Bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comm	24.677505493164062
4900/28840	Will you come said he to Porth	44.53360366821289
4901/28840	Where asked Porthos filling a second glass of	37.83490753173828
4902/28840	To present our respects to the	80.2581787109375
4903/28840	Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed DArtagn	40.211483001708984
4904/28840	As for Raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by DArtagnan to leave the room until the tumult was	33.75849914550781
4905/28840	They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely DArtagnan his captaincy Porthos his bar	60.44596862792969
4906/28840	DArtagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to	73.4218978881836
4907/28840	But though he held the cardinals promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage Porth	83.82621002197266
4908/28840	Whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for	113.04037475585938
4909/28840	Mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow	129.15077209472656
4910/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his	21.803585052490234
4911/28840	Those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of	107.81256103515625
4912/28840	The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the Spaniard it had just gained another over the	78.73974609375
4913/28840	Comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when DArtagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door behind the	36.60869216918945
4914/28840	Ah madame said Comminges hastening to DArtagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my	26.019824981689453
4915/28840	Without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint Cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the	80.03239440917969
4916/28840	DArtagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to	23.37495231628418
4917/28840	I know that sir I have known that said the queen a long time therefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my	52.33014678955078
4918/28840	Permit me madame said DArtagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of Tréville he has done	56.82802200317383
4919/28840	In the regiment said DArtagnan he is called Porthos the queen started but his true name is the Chevalier du Vall	24.905529022216797
4920/28840	These names are too numerous for me to remember them all and I will content myself with the first said the queen gr	56.17618179321289
4921/28840	At this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assembl	28.857805252075195
4922/28840	The fact was in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the	45.7697868347168
4923/28840	Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping	54.97404861450195
4924/28840	Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like Mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely	129.4429473876953
4925/28840	He therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill	110.30097198486328
4926/28840	The coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at	103.31307220458984
4927/28840	His speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their	115.02912902832031
4928/28840	He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys	94.10652923583984
4929/28840	Immediately the wits of the court plunged into	385.02825927734375

4931/28840	This caused a universal burst of	168.70632934570312
4932/28840	The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as Henry	35.728389739990234
4933/28840	had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Iv	66.87164306640625

4935/28840	The queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to	64.31559753417969
4936/28840	Yes madame replied the coadjutor I have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the	32.50680160522461

4945/28840	The only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a	52.719398498535156
4946/28840	The coadjutor went to him and held out his	26.950332641601562
4947/28840	The young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his	27.239227294921875
4948/28840	My dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor believe me I am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to	19.917383193969727
4949/28840	Is that true and do you speak seriously asked Louvie	71.12708282470703
4950/28840	From the depth of my heart said Gond	44.516910552978516
4951/28840	In that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be	70.63009643554688
4952/28840	Oh let us speak frankly continued Louvieres and act in a straightforward	64.98637390136719
4953/28840	Thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure Christian charity that would be too	76.88764953613281
4954/28840	You are ambitiousit is natural you are a man of genius and you know your	73.49608612060547
4955/28840	As for me I hate the court and have but one desire at this momentvenge	97.64583587646484
4956/28840	It was now the coadjutors turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvie	39.9740104675293
4957/28840	But Monsieur Louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me   You have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you	24.790693283081055
4958/28840	Never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires	31.737464904785156
4959/28840	And how many hours of reflection do you ask   Twelve hours sir is it too long   It is now noon at midnight I will be at your	56.98714828491211
4960/28840	If I should not be in wait for	34.1500244140625
4961/28840	When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his	69.79601287841797
4962/28840	Two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Paris had assembled	180.60003662109375
4963/28840	Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meillera	23.487960815429688
4964/28840	The curates asked him what was to be	58.717132568359375
4965/28840	You are the directors of all consci	99.93946838378906
4966/28840	For the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound I will listen to him with the greatest	82.32811737060547
4967/28840	You think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said Gond	42.51405715942383
4968/28840	My lord I have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to	44.14204025268555
4969/28840	Who and what is this man   A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his	26.55364990234375
4970/28840	What is his name   He is named Planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he	53.113224029541016
4971/28840	And can you find him   I hope	38.106536865234375
4972/28840	I think he has not been arrested and as I am his wifes confessor if she knows where he is I shall know it	45.40118408203125
4973/28840	Very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to	87.4614486694336
4974/28840	We will be with you at six oclock my	27.54941749572754
4975/28840	Go my dear curate and may God assist you   And you sir continued Gondy turning to the curate of	30.449556350708008
4976/28840	I my lord said the latter I know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of	58.769287109375
4977/28840	Him I can place at your disposal it is Count de Roche	65.34910583496094
4978/28840	I know him also but unfortunately he is not in	46.35383987426758
4979/28840	My lord he has been for three days at the Rue Cass	49.930633544921875
4980/28840	And wherefore has he not been to see me   He was toldmy lord will pardon me   Certainly	84.3814926147461
4981/28840	That your lordship was about to treat with the	56.41791915893555
4982/28840	Diable think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you   I offer you a beggar my	100.13542175292969
4983/28840	Bravo and the man   A plain and simple beggar as I have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of	89.36385345458984
4984/28840	Well the man whom I offer you is a general synd	85.37366485595703
4985/28840	And what do you know of him   Nothing my lord except that he is tormented with	27.836458206176758
4986/28840	What makes you think so   On the twentyeighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday I said this mass	102.04169464111328
4987/28840	And his name   Maillard but I do not think it is his right	29.37704849243164
4988/28840	And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post  	44.98933029174805
4989/28840	Let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true	53.906150817871094
4990/28840	Gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the cur	74.57132720947266
4991/28840	The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the	45.937652587890625
4992/28840	Eustache Church watching carefully to ascertain the popular	379.2326965332031
4993/28840	The people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle	72.5353012084961
4994/28840	On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the	68.29896545410156
4995/28840	Stop he said there he is at his	61.2144775390625
4996/28840	Gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his	50.60726547241211
4997/28840	Is it by permission that he remains there asked Gond	115.54444885253906
4998/28840	No my lord these places are	490.96343994140625
4999/28840	I believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for	54.63041305541992
5000/28840	The rascal is rich then   Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twentyfive and thirty thousand francs and sometimes	63.60198211669922
5001/28840	Hum said Gondy laughing I was not aware my alms were so well	41.711734771728516
5002/28840	In the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his	47.48699951171875
5003/28840	He was a man between sixtysix and sixtyeight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light	69.36479187011719
5004/28840	His countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principlesa wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by	285.03070068359375
5005/28840	He started on seeing the cavalier with the cur	44.85770797729492
5006/28840	The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the	34.99976348876953
5007/28840	Maillard began the curate this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a	101.41618347167969
5008/28840	With me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy	28.24933624267578
5009/28840	There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadj	43.24504470825195
5010/28840	Yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the	91.9793472290039
5011/28840	These are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the	600.512939453125
5012/28840	As to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means	194.0780792236328
5013/28840	Explain yourself my good friend said the coadj	39.12590408325195
5014/28840	I mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide	90.32054901123047
5015/28840	The war will not only be approved of but directed by the	116.61748504638672
5016/28840	As for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of Paris who has the very greatest power at the court of Rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to	51.84003829956055
5017/28840	Consider Maillard said the curate that I have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that I have made myself responsible for	30.925609588623047
5018/28840	I know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore I in my turn will be serviceable to	22.16681480407715
5019/28840	Ah ah said Gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades   I will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend	65.02527618408203
5020/28840	Ifaith exclaimed Gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le curé can answer for you   I answer for him said the cur	31.52963638305664
5021/28840	Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening at ten o	41.35358810424805
5022/28840	It must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of	101.29376220703125
5023/28840	Shall I give you a line for the vicar of	101.47945404052734
5024/28840	Jacques de la Boucherie he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the cur	57.274986267089844
5025/28840	Then said the coadjutor this evening at ten oclock and if I am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your	22.021947860717773
5026/28840	The eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his	81.73544311523438
5027/28840	This evening sir he replied all will be	173.9303741455078
5028/28840	At a quarter to six oclock Monsieur de Gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal	22.24616050720215
5029/28840	At six oclock the curate of	31.326568603515625
5030/28840	The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another	58.39352035522461
5031/28840	The curate then entered followed by Planc	51.752140045166016
5032/28840	Your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to	18.907405853271484
5033/28840	Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine	71.86222076416016
5034/28840	And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked Gond	32.52671813964844
5035/28840	I am a Frondist from my	24.99148941040039
5036/28840	You see in me such as I am a person sentenced to be	73.57203674316406
5037/28840	And on what account   I rescued from the hands of Mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile where he had been for five	47.79742431640625
5038/28840	Will you name him   Oh you know him well my lordit is Count de Roche	55.9302864074707
5039/28840	Ah really yes said the coadjutor I have heard this affair	45.928794860839844
5040/28840	You raised the whole district so they told me   Very nearly replied Planchet with a selfsatisfied	60.67658996582031
5041/28840	And your business is   That of a confectioner in the Rue des Lomb	20.198890686035156
5042/28840	Explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike incl	161.82614135742188
5043/28840	Well my lord before I became a confectioner I myself was three years sergeant in the Piedmontese regiment and before I became sergeant I was for eighteen months the servant of Monsieur dArtagn	44.74486541748047
5044/28840	But he is said to be a furious Mazarin	41.750885009765625
5045/28840	You are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you   You may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the	49.31153869628906
5046/28840	How many men think you you could collect together tonight   Two hundred muskets and five hundred halber	90.64500427246094
5047/28840	Let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by tomorrow we shall have quite a powerful	88.32564544677734
5048/28840	Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort   I would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as I believe him entirely capable of the	70.36285400390625
5049/28840	Bravo   By what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes   Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his	100.655029296875
5050/28840	Do you want money   Money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more	151.99542236328125
5051/28840	Gondy went to a box and drew forth a	54.858673095703125
5052/28840	Here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum	75.25385284423828
5053/28840	I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said Planchet putting the bag under his	54.09017562866211
5054/28840	That is right I recommend the cardinal to your	124.49314880371094
5055/28840	Make your mind easy he is in good	113.47404479980469
5056/28840	Planchet went out the curate remaining for a	40.32123565673828
5057/28840	Are you satisfied my lord he	52.07189178466797
5058/28840	Yes he appears to be a resolute	43.32852554321289
5059/28840	Well he will do more than he has	57.74837112426758
5060/28840	The curate rejoined Planchet who was waiting for him on the	20.372264862060547
5061/28840	Ten minutes later the curate of	51.62114334106445
5062/28840	As soon as the door of Gondys study was opened a man rushed	68.28173828125
5063/28840	Tis you then my dear count cried Gondy offering his	27.587356567382812
5064/28840	You have made up your mind at last my lord said Roche	33.45761489868164
5065/28840	It has been made up a long time said Gond	24.623266220092773
5066/28840	Let us say no more on the subject you tell me so I believe	50.86969757080078
5067/28840	Well we are going to give a ball to Maz	27.517040252685547
5068/28840	And when will the dance begin   The invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow	65.07577514648438
5069/28840	You may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier dHumieres has promised me whenever I need	41.560279846191406
5070/28840	Upon fifty soldiers   Yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over I shall replace	71.12830352783203
5071/28840	Good my dear Rochefort but that is not	35.162349700927734
5072/28840	What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort   He is in Vendome where he will wait until I write to him to return to	23.279518127441406
5073/28840	You are sure of your enterprise   Yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of Paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead	63.72428894042969
5074/28840	If he defers he will find the place of honor	160.1728973388672
5075/28840	Shall I send word to him as coming from you   Yes	72.74520874023438
5076/28840	Shall I tell him that he can count on you   To the	42.50582504272461
5077/28840	And you will leave the command to him   Of the war yes but in politics   You must know it is not his	51.23763656616211
5078/28840	He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own	59.48929214477539
5079/28840	You care about it then so much   Since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said Gondy I wish at least that the hat should be	83.39960479736328
5080/28840	One must not dispute matters of taste and colors said Rochefort	197.35867309570312
5081/28840	How soon can he be here   In five	86.343994140625
5082/28840	Let him come and he will find a change I will answer for	40.09381866455078
5083/28840	Therefore go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in	213.6447296142578
5084/28840	Is there any signal for the general rally   A knot of straw in the	64.28677368164062
5085/28840	Ah Monsieur Mazarin Monsieur Mazarin said Rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether I am too old to be a man of	30.819499969482422
5086/28840	It was halfpast nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of	24.514108657836914
5087/28840	He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the	42.90342330932617
5088/28840	Good said he our syndic is at his	147.76548767089844
5089/28840	He knocked and the door was	41.1076774597168
5090/28840	Although the key was in the door the coadjutor	36.003719329833984
5091/28840	Come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle	42.77341842651367
5092/28840	He rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock	28.178354263305664
5093/28840	Well said Gondy have you kept your word with me   Not exactly replied the mendic	29.79486846923828

5095/28840	You are not boasting   Do you wish for a proof  	17.95769691467285
5096/28840	There were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the Palais Royal and a third upon the Rue Saint	64.67532348632812
5097/28840	The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the	96.71778869628906

5105/28840	The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold	39.88394546508789
5106/28840	Ah ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good	34.847171783447266
5107/28840	The mendicant sighed and threw down the	44.49199676513672

5110/28840	His face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward	72.61901092529297
5111/28840	Singular man muttered Gondy taking his hat to go away but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the	77.52904510498047
5112/28840	His first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasp	34.54875564575195
5113/28840	Your blessing your holiness before you go I beseech you he	66.6052474975586
5114/28840	Your holiness said Gondy my friend you take me for some one	32.61009979248047
5115/28840	No your holiness I take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor I recognized you at the first	37.72755432128906
5116/28840	And you want my blessing he	153.1844024658203
5117/28840	The mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was	31.229328155517578
5118/28840	Now said Gondy there is a communion between	36.20039749145508

5121/28840	The crime which I have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just	75.4244155883789

5130/28840	It was about eleven oclock at	48.88090896606445
5131/28840	Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of	41.826377868652344
5132/28840	The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horse	173.2922821044922
5133/28840	Gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire	72.21297454833984
5134/28840	He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach	89.5434341430664
5135/28840	These men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had	267.1673889160156
5136/28840	One individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he	126.39515686035156
5137/28840	By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized Planc	29.523658752441406
5138/28840	The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la Monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower	47.73872375488281
5139/28840	They were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to	215.81747436523438
5140/28840	All these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a mus	69.75392150878906
5141/28840	On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached	29.420421600341797
5142/28840	I do not know you for one of	18.150386810302734
5143/28840	Then it is because you do not know your friends my dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor raising his	15.577820777893066
5144/28840	Gondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nes	78.66329956054688
5145/28840	There he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the	90.95770263671875
5146/28840	They might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white clo	75.05094909667969
5147/28840	When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their	81.03617095947266
5148/28840	Gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but	79.03050994873047
5149/28840	The last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived Gond	76.3224868774414
5150/28840	He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his	55.26375961303711
5151/28840	Halloo Monsieur de Rochefort said Gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms   Rochefort recognized the	32.486026763916016
5152/28840	Ah it is you my lord said	35.00807571411133
5153/28840	What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth   My fifty recruits from the Chevalier dHumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white clo	58.74104690551758
5154/28840	And where are you going   To the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his	54.45259094238281
5155/28840	Very good said Gondy shaking Rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after	58.092411041259766
5156/28840	It was now one oclock in the morning and the coadjutor returned	24.119539260864258
5157/28840	He opened a window and leaned out to	129.19480895996094
5158/28840	A strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as oceans most unfathomable	180.31134033203125
5159/28840	From time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an	80.57225799560547
5160/28840	The work of revolt continued the whole night	305.49383544921875
5161/28840	The next morning on awaking Paris seemed to be startled at her own	93.34951782226562
5162/28840	Armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every	253.0083465576172
5163/28840	Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry Long live Broussel Down with Mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even	88.41468048095703
5164/28840	They had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not	80.08493041992188
5165/28840	The barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais	30.799158096313477
5166/28840	Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were	84.05335998535156
5167/28840	Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his	92.0995101928711
5168/28840	As for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasant	32.44166946411133
5169/28840	The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually	225.4353790283203
5170/28840	He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the Pont du Louvre but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred	48.07590103149414
5171/28840	The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the qu	66.68505096435547
5172/28840	But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his	36.36531066894531
5173/28840	This time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the	108.32157897949219
5174/28840	He beat a retreat toward the market but there he met Planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threatening	64.90022277832031
5175/28840	He attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of	55.73314666748047
5176/28840	The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eust	21.908954620361328
5177/28840	They were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and	266.7681579589844
5178/28840	Master Friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous	54.14871597290039
5179/28840	The marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through	116.71790313720703
5180/28840	He dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the	119.30354309082031
5181/28840	The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he	32.14731979370117
5182/28840	He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the	171.89109802246094
5183/28840	The guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of	154.69924926757812
5184/28840	Men fell around him as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Ler	75.54679870605469
5185/28840	Fontrailles his aidedecamp had an arm broken his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by	76.48705291748047
5186/28840	The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet	36.070823669433594
5187/28840	Get me out of this in Heavens name he said or I shall leave my carcass here and those of all my	68.60346221923828
5188/28840	A great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been	55.982208251953125
5189/28840	Gondy raised his hand and demanded	141.050048828125
5190/28840	My children he said this is the Marechal de la Meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the Louvre to demand of the queen in your name our Broussels	39.31654357910156
5191/28840	You pledge yourself to that marshal added Gondy turning to La Meillera	31.244461059570312
5192/28840	Morbleu cried the latter I should say that I do pledge myself to it I had no hope of getting off so	53.72986602783203
5193/28840	He gives you his word of honor said Gond	49.52700424194336
5194/28840	The marshal raised his hand in token of ass	29.503320693969727
5195/28840	Long live the coadjutor cried the	59.319984436035156
5196/28840	It was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed	121.76866912841797
5197/28840	In the meantime as we have said Mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in	70.4590072631836
5198/28840	He called for DArtagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him DArtagnan not being on	38.70240020751953
5199/28840	In about ten minutes DArtagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable Porth	18.490028381347656
5200/28840	Ah come in come in Monsieur dArtagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend	43.52781295776367
5201/28840	But what is going on in this accursed Paris   What is going on my lord nothing good replied DArtagnan shaking his	25.541656494140625
5202/28840	Down with Mazarin Ifaith the treasonable word is	171.36183166503906
5203/28840	Ifaith no said DArtagnan I was not in voice Monsieur du Vallon has a cold and did not cry	38.319644927978516
5204/28840	Then my lord   Then what asked Maz	42.460227966308594
5205/28840	And DArtagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his be	72.95366668701172
5206/28840	As for Porthoss coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in	101.44306945800781
5207/28840	Diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration I should have cried I	56.492706298828125
5208/28840	At this moment the tumult was heard	124.75437927246094
5209/28840	Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around	226.59999084472656
5210/28840	He had a great desire to go to the window but he dared	28.146146774291992
5211/28840	See what is going on Monsieur DArtagnan said	11.08128833770752
5212/28840	DArtagnan went to the window with his habitual	13.803376197814941
5213/28840	But if they fire all is lost cried DArtagn	60.216026306152344
5214/28840	The gates to hold for five minutesthe gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder Gods death dont fire screamed DArtagnan throwing open the	158.63963317871094
5215/28840	In spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible	66.06043243408203
5216/28840	The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Royal and one of them passing under DArtagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which Porthos was complacently admiring	37.62810134887695
5217/28840	But what do you advise then asked Mazarin	61.62934112548828
5218/28840	Eh egad to give up Broussel as they demand What the devil do you want with a member of the parliament He is of no earthly use to	56.008697509765625
5219/28840	And you Monsieur du Vallon is that your advice What would you do   I should give up Broussel said Porth	14.448989868164062
5220/28840	Come come with me gentlemen exclaimed Maz	89.6932601928711
5221/28840	I will go and discuss the matter with the	36.25563430786133
5222/28840	He stopped at the end of the corridor and said   I can count upon you gentlemen can I not   We do not give ourselves twice over said DArtagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall	39.05065155029297
5223/28840	Very well then said Mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till I come	126.89015197753906
5224/28840	And turning off he entered the drawingroom by another	89.87045288085938
5225/28840	The queen was standing in the room pale with anger her selfcontrol however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was	61.10747528076172
5226/28840	Comminges Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the	86.38430786132812
5227/28840	Then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was	105.68891906738281
5228/28840	Fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to	111.474853515625
5229/28840	Then disguised in the clothes of the Marquis dO he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street	56.85054397583008
5230/28840	During the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to	55.287986755371094
5231/28840	Well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all   I think that matters look very gloomy mad	36.88034439086914
5232/28840	But what step would you propose to me   I could propose one to your majesty but I dare	40.38225555419922
5233/28840	You may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid	64.1287612915039
5234/28840	The chancellor reddened and stammered some	104.82014465332031
5235/28840	It is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me advicewhat is it   Madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release Brous	45.171852111816406
5236/28840	The queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was	272.466552734375
5237/28840	Release Broussel she cried never   At this moment steps were heard in the anteroom and without any announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the	21.184814453125
5238/28840	Ah there you are marechal cried Anne of Austria joy	46.1265754699707

5242/28840	I know not where I have left my hat and in all probability I should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue	39.32501983642578
5243/28840	Ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all	113.78201293945312
5244/28840	Madame said La Meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still	67.92916107177734

5247/28840	Oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission   The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the mare	58.03759002685547
5248/28840	Pardon madame he said I am not a lawyer I am a mere soldier and probably therefore I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words I ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the	46.94379806518555
5249/28840	As for what you do me the honor to say I presume you mean I was afraid   The queen	34.43765640258789
5250/28840	Well then madame yes I did feel fear and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I cannot count how many charges and skirmishes I own for the third time in my life I was	85.33479309082031
5251/28840	Yes and I would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know not whence unless from deepest	309.894775390625
5252/28840	Bravo said DArtagnan in a whisper to Porthos well	38.584102630615234
5253/28840	Well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people   That Broussel shall be given up to them mad	44.72747039794922
5254/28840	Never said the queen never   Your majesty is mistress said La Meilleraie retreating a few	43.36921310424805
5255/28840	Where are you going marechal asked the	28.594879150390625
5256/28840	To give your majestys reply to those who await	40.713680267333984
5257/28840	Stay marechal I will not appear to parley with	66.15552520751953
5258/28840	Madame I have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to	46.53947067260742
5259/28840	Anne of Austrias eyes shot glances of	277.59521484375
5260/28840	Oh that is no impediment sir said she I have had greater men than you arrestedGuitant   Mazarin sprang	70.84529113769531
5261/28840	Madame said he if I dared in my turn advise   Would it be to give up Broussel sir If so you can spare yourself the	57.91539764404297
5262/28840	No said Mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any	93.27383422851562
5263/28840	Then what may it be   To call for monsieur le coadjute	14.634957313537598
5264/28840	The coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker It is he who has raised all this	58.9266471862793
5265/28840	The more reason said Mazarin if he has raised it he can put it	78.14303588867188
5266/28840	And hold madame suggested Comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the Palais	62.64241027832031
5267/28840	It is true she said the arch hypocritesee   I see said Mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst I were I in his place though I am cardinal should be torn to	72.18980407714844
5268/28840	I persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadj	48.31436538696289
5269/28840	And wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low	46.376869201660156
5270/28840	Monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to	21.169391632080078
5271/28840	And what shall I say to the people   That they must have patience said Anne as I	43.507877349853516
5272/28840	The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went	63.82719802856445
5273/28840	We shall soon see said Porthos in his tranquil	41.586936950683594
5274/28840	In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by DArtagnan and Porth	24.67359161376953
5275/28840	Ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadj	27.434555053710938
5276/28840	There madame he said is Monsieur Gondy who hastens to obey your majestys	20.691621780395508
5277/28840	The queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protr	66.81930541992188
5278/28840	Well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot   That it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a	37.3482551574707
5279/28840	The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried Anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the	73.11351013183594
5280/28840	Revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to	134.1481475830078
5281/28840	Is it true asked Gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion   Yes said the queen it is	32.325382232666016
5282/28840	Your majesty wishes then   You to say what you would do in her place Mazarin hastened to	75.19889831542969
5283/28840	The coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the	33.33552932739258
5284/28840	Were I in her majestys place said Gondy coldly I should not hesitate I should release Brous	43.14634323120117
5285/28840	And if I do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the	46.65730667114258
5286/28840	I believe that not a stone in Paris will remain unturned put in the mare	78.93270111083984
5287/28840	It was not your opinion that I asked said the queen sharply without even turning	119.44340515136719
5288/28840	If it is I whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner I reply that I hold monsieur le marechals opinion in every	50.82876968383789
5289/28840	The color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with	82.99258422851562
5290/28840	Mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was	215.64601135253906
5291/28840	Give up Broussel she cried fine counsel	306.810302734375
5292/28840	Upon my word one can easily see it comes from a	84.65485382080078
5293/28840	Gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by	84.05247497558594
5294/28840	He looked coldly at the queen who nudged Mazarin to make him say something in his	44.20846939086914
5295/28840	Mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying	927.9782104492188
5296/28840	Ho ho said he good advice advice of a	386.8128967285156
5297/28840	I too would give up that good Monsieur Broussel dead or alive and all would be at an	45.27615737915039
5298/28840	If you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you	120.28679656982422
5299/28840	Did I say dead or alive replied Maz	70.15751647949219
5300/28840	It was only a way of	99.8283920288086
5301/28840	You know I am not familiar with the French language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so	28.172653198242188
5302/28840	This is a council of state DArtagnan remarked to Porthos but we held better ones at La Rochelle with Athos and Aram	38.76799774169922
5303/28840	At the Saint Gervais bastion said Porth	39.169837951660156
5304/28840	The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity   Madame if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to	54.162479400634766
5305/28840	I know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a	72.1280746459961
5306/28840	Thus then it is your opinion said Anne of Austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution   Yes madame replied the coadjutor grave	49.30070877075195
5307/28840	But if I am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all	67.79483032226562
5308/28840	It is a bad year for kings said Gondy shaking his head look at England mad	55.05607604980469
5309/28840	Yes but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France replied the	38.73607635498047
5310/28840	Who knows said Gondy such men are like thunderboltsone recognizes them only when they have	78.75017547607422
5311/28840	Every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her	39.51932144165039
5312/28840	Porthos murmured DArtagnan look well at that	26.42837905883789
5313/28840	What then   Well he is a	22.227876663208008
5314/28840	Evidently he did not understand his	137.8500518798828
5315/28840	Your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but I foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the riot	71.3062515258789
5316/28840	In that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon	44.965736389160156
5317/28840	Perhaps it will be too late said Gondy still unmoved perhaps I shall have lost all influence while by giving up Broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the	56.617183685302734
5318/28840	Have I not then that right cried the	148.38357543945312
5319/28840	If you have it use it replied Gond	45.105594635009766
5320/28840	There is a man after my own	75.69994354248047
5321/28840	Oh if he were minister and I were his DArtagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a Mazarin mordieu what fine things we would do together   Yes said Porth	53.065757751464844
5322/28840	The queen made a sign for every one except Mazarin to quit the room and Gondy bowed as if to leave with the	39.17119216918945
5323/28840	Good thought Gondy she is going to	58.06161880493164
5324/28840	She is going to have him killed said DArtagnan to Porthos but at all events it shall not be by	25.820802688598633
5325/28840	I swear to Heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him I will fall upon	42.60905838012695
5326/28840	Good muttered Mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something	49.983707427978516
5327/28840	The queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned	127.3124008178711
5328/28840	It was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and	73.41976165771484
5329/28840	And now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjute	28.4891357421875
5330/28840	It is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release Broussel from prison and give him back to the	68.58818817138672
5331/28840	The coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the	63.29613494873047
5332/28840	At the first words of this address DArtagnan had seized Porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing	52.11619186401367
5333/28840	When Mazarin ceased speaking he said to Porthos in a low tone   Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish or I am a lost man and you are	35.988990783691406
5334/28840	The queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said   Pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what I	106.29298400878906
5335/28840	A woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex I am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed I am excited at the first	82.58837890625
5336/28840	Madame replied Gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as	72.1942367553711
5337/28840	Your majesty has none but submissive and respectful	151.8321533203125
5338/28840	It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for Broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your	58.80221939086914
5339/28840	Ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought Gond	81.82825469970703
5340/28840	And what will he promise us said DArtagn	43.210269927978516
5341/28840	Peste if he is giving away hats like that Porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment	108.35773468017578
5342/28840	Corbleu let the civil war last but one year and I will have a constables sword gilt for	184.2496337890625
5343/28840	For you I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just	21.96744155883789
5344/28840	And so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public	92.54117584228516
5345/28840	Seriously said Gondy astonished at not having further advanced I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful	158.09938049316406
5346/28840	And I said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose	94.6464614868164
5347/28840	Gondy looked at Mazarin astonished and Mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the Palais	25.45294952392578
5348/28840	Gondy smiled the queens color rose and Mazarin grew even pal	133.44674682617188
5349/28840	At this moment Comminges rushed into the	40.56638717651367
5350/28840	Pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands   Listen madame said Gond	42.99214172363281
5351/28840	The moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that	125.46387481689453
5352/28840	What are my commands said the	81.89469146728516
5353/28840	How many men have you about the Palais Royal   Six	69.45399475097656
5354/28840	Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for	96.18162536621094
5355/28840	Madame cried Mazarin what are you about   Go said the	34.03147506713867
5356/28840	Comminges went out with a soldiers passive	257.4969177246094
5357/28840	At this moment a monstrous battering was	55.9969482421875
5358/28840	One of the gates began to	102.60944366455078
5359/28840	Oh madame cried Mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and	105.2962646484375
5360/28840	At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal Anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comm	124.78514862060547
5361/28840	It is too late said Mazarin tearing his hair too late   The gale had given	50.24917221069336
5362/28840	Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited	543.7046508789062
5363/28840	DArtagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to Porthos to follow his	15.47656536102295
5364/28840	Save the queen cried Mazarin to the coadj	38.681976318359375
5365/28840	Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized Louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand	25.458370208740234
5366/28840	Not a step further he shouted the queen is signing   What are you saying asked the	85.34757232666016
5367/28840	The truth madame said Mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then he added Sign Anne I implore youI command	92.1032485961914
5368/28840	The queen fell into a chair took the pen and	106.52450561523438
5369/28840	The people kept back by Louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people	124.7134017944336
5370/28840	The queen had written The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty and she had signed	59.2929801940918
5371/28840	The coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his	65.60938262939453
5372/28840	And now that you have obtained what you want go said she Monsieur de Gond	32.956207275390625
5373/28840	Whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows I am at her	46.84795379638672
5374/28840	Ah cursed priest cried Anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day I will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me	105.99420928955078
5375/28840	Leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the	36.097320556640625
5376/28840	It is you who are not a woman muttered Maz	49.588157653808594
5377/28840	Then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left DArtagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard	32.14614486694336
5378/28840	He knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed	30.260217666625977
5379/28840	At the queens last word DArtagnan had dragged Porthos into the	48.37755584716797
5380/28840	Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and	57.33280563354492
5381/28840	Why did you leave the closet Monsieur dArtagnan asked the	19.601058959960938
5382/28840	Because replied DArtagnan the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the	41.634822845458984
5383/28840	And you have been here since   About a quarter of an hour said DArtagnan motioning to Porthos not to contradict	14.974380493164062
5384/28840	Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that DArtagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his	85.52760314941406
5385/28840	Decidedly Monsieur dArtagnan you are the man I have been	18.754619598388672
5386/28840	You may reckon upon me and so may your	93.16563415527344
5387/28840	Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though by	45.600826263427734
5388/28840	Anne of Austria returned to her oratory	139.82058715820312
5389/28840	a prisoner at Vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a Brousselgood God what then is to become of royalty   The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting	104.48829650878906
5390/28840	The people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for Broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending	61.268795013427734
5391/28840	During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror starred in every	37.676307678222656
5392/28840	Ah he said it is sad I know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our	71.9127197265625
5393/28840	What matters it about Brousselit is a name not a	82.09075927734375
5394/28840	Mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken Broussel was a thing not a	312.04290771484375
5395/28840	The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of	93.69003295898438
5396/28840	The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three	377.660888671875
5397/28840	By his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barric	135.2615509033203
5398/28840	They now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barric	128.3861541748047
5399/28840	Rochefort had returned to the Chevalier dHumieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll	98.3693618774414
5400/28840	But the chevalier was himself at heart a Frondist and would hear nothing said of	98.75704956054688
5401/28840	The mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the	41.43824005126953
5402/28840	No one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of	129.2086181640625

5502/28840	So much the worse sir said Anne of Austria so much the worse at least for the queen for today she has need of the same courage and the same	49.2366943359375
5503/28840	She had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the Gascon	82.58010864257812
5504/28840	She had allowed herself to be exceeded in	133.1271209716797
5505/28840	All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded Monsieur dArtagnan is doubtless true said the queen but I have confidence in you	30.003929138183594

5515/28840	The queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which DArtagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her	72.79204559326172
5516/28840	It was one of the Gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough	79.2218017578125
5517/28840	Has the queen any further commands for me now asked DArtagn	95.47665405273438
5518/28840	No sir replied Anne of Austria and you may retire until the time that I mentioned to	36.30826187133789
5519/28840	Diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just	71.1948471069336
5520/28840	Then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinals	70.087158203125
5521/28840	I come for your commands my lord he	69.7922134399414
5522/28840	And according to his custom DArtagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before	43.115699768066406
5523/28840	But it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was	46.54253387451172

5536/28840	In fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was	133.43624877929688

5549/28840	Ten minutes elapsed during which DArtagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the	39.57167053222656
5550/28840	He seated himself at his desk and DArtagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the	36.736183166503906

5565/28840	Only leave him in the anteroom as I wish to speak to you	24.53837013244629
5566/28840	DArtagnan bowed and thought Both at the same hour both commands alike both at the Palais	49.30813980102539
5567/28840	Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret   You are thoughtful said Mazarin uneas	19.294628143310547
5568/28840	Yes I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or	138.219970703125
5569/28840	Very well my lord it shall be	68.88999938964844
5570/28840	DArtagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend Mazarins flattering promises which gave Porthos an indescribable	30.294368743896484
5571/28840	When DArtagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejo	31.10515022277832
5572/28840	The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask	58.40641403198242
5573/28840	The return also of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving a grand	124.80888366699219
5574/28840	The princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her	127.48347473144531
5575/28840	Anne of Austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with grace and	123.64891815185547
5576/28840	Mazarin disappeared as they rose from	1563.559326171875
5577/28840	He found DArtagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anter	24.261106491088867
5578/28840	The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his	41.73866271972656
5579/28840	dArtagnan said the minister sitting down I am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an	45.72997283935547
5580/28840	I hope said DArtagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of	26.637088775634766
5581/28840	More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend therefore I apply to	93.37907409667969
5582/28840	We are about to leave this evening continued Maz	51.42458724975586
5583/28840	dArtagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your	47.171993255615234
5584/28840	Explain yourself my lord I am	155.4977569580078
5585/28840	The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germ	35.32290267944336
5586/28840	Aha said DArtagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave	22.857419967651367
5587/28840	It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o	71.83094024658203
5588/28840	Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one muttered DArtagn	67.8041763305664
5589/28840	Oh women women whether queens or not they are always the	269.54168701171875
5590/28840	Do you disapprove of this journey my dear	39.378639221191406
5591/28840	I my lord said DArtagnan why should I   Because you shrug your	30.043821334838867
5592/28840	It is a way I have of speaking to	116.86236572265625
5593/28840	I neither approve nor disapprove my lord I merely await your	128.9283447265625
5594/28840	Good it is you accordingly that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germ	56.34457778930664
5595/28840	You see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving DArtagnans composure that as I have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your	43.031150817871094
5596/28840	Yes my lord and I feel the whole responsibility of such a	54.95900344848633
5597/28840	You accept however   I always	126.2870864868164
5598/28840	Do you think the thing possible   Everything is	54.061038970947266
5599/28840	Shall you be attacked on the road  	103.28421783447266
5600/28840	And what will you do in that case   I shall pass through those who attack	36.71628952026367
5601/28840	And suppose you cannot pass through them   So much the worse for them I shall pass over	35.74241256713867
5602/28840	And you will place the king and queen in safety also at Saint Germain  	56.00279235839844
5603/28840	On your life   On my	38.6601448059082
5604/28840	You are a hero my friend said Mazarin gazing at the musketeer with	38.027462005615234
5605/28840	And I asked Mazarin after a moments	71.68360137939453
5606/28840	How and you my lord   If I wish to leave   That would be much more	31.9353084564209
5607/28840	Why so   Your eminence might be	38.75200271606445
5608/28840	Even under this disguise asked Mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with	65.90251922607422
5609/28840	If your eminence is disguised it will be almost	61.859519958496094
5610/28840	Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for the Sicilian vesp	98.32654571533203
5611/28840	The streets are full of armed men continued DArtagn	45.97880554199219
5612/28840	Are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project   Mazarin	36.537994384765625
5613/28840	This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for	72.41452026367188
5614/28840	Mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn	148.3673858642578
5615/28840	And therefore added he quietly I have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that I have fixed upon you to escort	56.351776123046875
5616/28840	Shall you not go with the queen   No replied Maz	31.134456634521484
5617/28840	Then you will start after the queen   No said Mazarin	53.623043060302734
5618/28840	Ah said DArtagnan who began to	14.744376182556152
5619/28840	With the queen I double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe I might be	392.7827453613281
5620/28840	Very true said DArtagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamond which Mazarin wore on his	27.6450138092041
5621/28840	Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring	243.96702575683594
5622/28840	I wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to	35.469566345214844
5623/28840	It is but Christian charity replied DArtagnan not to lead ones neighbors into	66.89122772216797
5624/28840	It is exactly for that reason said Mazarin that I wish to start before	55.98085021972656
5625/28840	DArtagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute	80.8590316772461
5626/28840	Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the	338.2489013671875
5627/28840	You will begin therefore by taking me first out of Paris will you not my dear	85.73683166503906
5628/28840	dArtagnan   A difficult commission my lord replied DArtagnan resuming his serious	27.192237854003906
5629/28840	But said Mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and	43.301353454589844
5630/28840	The king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and I must give it for	45.20419692993164
5631/28840	These two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the	116.17098236083984
5632/28840	But also said Mazarin you must understand that if I ask this service from you it is with the intention of being	52.89609146118164
5633/28840	Is it still only an intention your eminence asked DArtagn	53.69325256347656
5634/28840	Stay said Mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear DArtagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it I	47.65526580810547
5635/28840	DArtagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable	38.95753860473633
5636/28840	I valued it much said Mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless I give it to you with great	89.64122772216797
5637/28840	And I my lord said DArtagnan accept it as it is	33.414886474609375
5638/28840	Come let us speak of your little	71.60919952392578
5639/28840	You wish to leave before everybody and at what hour   At ten o	35.890621185302734
5640/28840	And the queen at what time is it her wish to start   At	92.79777526855469
5641/28840	I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for	61.244224548339844
5642/28840	Capital but how will you get me out of Paris   Oh as to that you must leave it to	35.24705505371094
5643/28840	I give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you	180.8543243408203
5644/28840	It seems to me however said Mazarin the safest	74.86383056640625
5645/28840	Yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the	34.47853088378906
5646/28840	Nevertheless   Or find some one else continued DArtagnan turning his	41.815895080566406
5647/28840	Oh muttered Mazarin I do believe he is going off with the diamond	71.20713806152344
5648/28840	dArtagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything   I will answer for	31.150672912597656
5649/28840	Well then let us goI must trust to	51.66184616088867
5650/28840	It is very fortunate said DArtagnan to	14.49355697631836
5651/28840	You will be here at halfpast	20.113033294677734
5652/28840	And I shall find your eminence ready   Certainly quite	71.26750183105469
5653/28840	Well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen   For what purpose   I wish to receive her majestys commands from her own	33.69777297973633
5654/28840	She desired me to give them to	23.935523986816406
5655/28840	You really wish to see her   It is indispensable my	23.302536010742188
5656/28840	Mazarin hesitated for one instant but DArtagnan was	182.60658264160156
5657/28840	Come then said the minister I will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our	60.118595123291016
5658/28840	What has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied DArtagn	50.33606719970703
5659/28840	I never swear my lord I say yes or no and as I am a gentleman I keep my	96.67315673828125
5660/28840	Come then I see that I must trust unreservedly to	23.872623443603516
5661/28840	Believe me my lord it will be your best	103.32608795166016
5662/28840	Come said Mazarin conducting DArtagnan into the queens oratory and desiring him to wait	52.221405029296875
5663/28840	He did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala	72.68622589111328
5664/28840	Thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of	113.9490737915039
5665/28840	It is you Monsieur DArtagnan she said smiling graciously I thank you for having insisted on seeing	32.26494598388672
5666/28840	I ought to ask your majestys pardon but I wished to receive your commands from your own	25.339941024780273
5667/28840	Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you   With	49.73738479614258
5668/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan continued the queen I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the	28.743146896362305
5669/28840	Your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and I know not what you mean said DArtagnan b	32.57001876831055
5670/28840	Go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at	120.59347534179688
5671/28840	And DArtagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet sl	31.281475067138672
5672/28840	Good thought he Mazarin has been listening to discover whether I betrayed	137.39698791503906
5673/28840	In truth that Italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest	62.97454833984375
5674/28840	DArtagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he entered the anter	21.799894332885742
5675/28840	He found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled	59.86508560180664
5676/28840	And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon are we not to enjoy his society   Certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais	24.319080352783203
5677/28840	And we start in his carriage then   Yes my	33.30863571166992
5678/28840	And with us no other escort but you two   Is it not enough One of us would	105.95004272460938
5679/28840	Really my dear Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles	32.5418586730957
5680/28840	I should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with	46.32859420776367
5681/28840	And Bernouindo I not take him with me   There is no room for him he will rejoin your em	30.061992645263672
5682/28840	Let us go said Mazarin since everything must be done as you	53.629817962646484
5683/28840	My lord there is time to draw back said DArtagnan and your eminence is perfectly	31.51177978515625
5684/28840	Not at all not at all said Mazarin let us be	57.17792510986328
5685/28840	And so they descended the private stair Mazarin leaning on the arm of DArtagnan a hand the musketeer felt	40.35555648803711
5686/28840	At last after crossing the courts of the Palais Royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little	69.38404846191406
5687/28840	Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the key	81.2863998413086
5688/28840	Give it to me said DArtagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that	72.5085678100586
5689/28840	The steps were already down and the door	113.90496063232422
5690/28840	Mousqueton stood at the door and Porthos was inside the	30.881208419799805
5691/28840	Mount my lord said DArtagnan to Mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second	27.536481857299805
5692/28840	DArtagnan followed him and Mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many gro	27.545686721801758
5693/28840	The carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a	101.9941635131836
5694/28840	The cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around	22.098411560058594
5695/28840	On his left was Porthos whilst DArtagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either	42.42121887207031
5696/28840	Before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistolsone in front of Porthos and the other of DArtagn	45.72758483886719
5697/28840	About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped the	42.131980895996094
5698/28840	Mazarin replied DArtagnan bursting into a	103.19195556640625
5699/28840	But the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an impr	100.51569366455078
5700/28840	A good journey to ye they cried allowing it to	280.6771545410156
5701/28840	Hem said DArtagnan what does my lord think of that reply   Man of talent cried Maz	36.960487365722656
5702/28840	In truth said Porthos I understand but now   About the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a second	37.87865447998047
5703/28840	Who goes there inquired the captain of the	138.76345825195312
5704/28840	And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between	87.01355743408203
5705/28840	Who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst DArtagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses	50.043853759765625
5706/28840	But putting his head out of the carriage   Eh Planchet said	17.487272262573242
5707/28840	The chief approached and it was indeed Planchet DArtagnan had recognized the voice of his old	32.878292083740234
5708/28840	How sir said Planchet is it you   Eh mon Dieu yes my good friend this worthy Porthos has just received a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint	38.252044677734375
5709/28840	Porthos said DArtagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear Porthos to this good Planc	27.538410186767578
5710/28840	Planchet my friend said Porthos in a melancholy voice I am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to	35.90153503417969
5711/28840	Oh good Heaven said Planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen   I will tell you all about it replied Mousqu	22.197498321533203
5712/28840	Make way for us Planchet said DArtagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my	52.43006896972656
5713/28840	Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says In that case things look	44.784812927246094
5714/28840	Then he exclaimed turning to his men   Let them pass they are	57.455711364746094
5715/28840	The carriage resumed its course and Mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe	96.30957794189453
5716/28840	A few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of illlooking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of Saint Eust	72.7381591796875
5717/28840	Porthos placed his hand on the	30.01055335998535
5718/28840	My lord I think we are in bad	78.66622161865234
5719/28840	A man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his	77.84140014648438

5724/28840	Peste said Porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles	32.75947570800781
5725/28840	I will pay you two hundred for them said Maz	36.29444122314453
5726/28840	Yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung	132.13214111328125
5727/28840	If one of them comes to my side asked Porthos must I kill him   Yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extrem	43.44447326660156
5728/28840	Come and open then cried DArtagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the	61.7457389831543
5729/28840	And as the man approached DArtagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a	43.50502395629883
5730/28840	Without doubt he recognized DArtagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his	48.76581954956055
5731/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan he cried falling back a step it is Monsieur dArtagnan let him	15.852778434753418
5732/28840	DArtagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was	38.24679946899414
5733/28840	The noise was caused by Porthos who had just knocked down his	53.677364349365234
5734/28840	DArtagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces	28.9092960357666
5735/28840	There was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the	85.45639038085938
5736/28840	To Cours la Reine cried DArtagnan to the coachman then turning to Mazarin he said Now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to Heaven for your deliver	43.34422302246094
5737/28840	Mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a	131.4752960205078
5738/28840	Five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached Cours la Re	59.784725189208984
5739/28840	Is my lord pleased with his escort asked DArtagn	38.684181213378906
5740/28840	Enchanted monsieur said Mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the	27.4918212890625
5741/28840	It will not be so difficult replied DArtagnan springing to the	25.710969924926758
5742/28840	Monsieur du Vallon I commend his eminence to your	37.068424224853516
5743/28840	Be quite at ease said Porthos holding out his hand which DArtagnan took and shook in	32.67593002319336
5744/28840	Oh cried Porthos as if in	39.54990005493164
5745/28840	DArtagnan looked with surprise at his	25.378501892089844
5746/28840	What is the matter then he	30.772470474243164
5747/28840	I think I have sprained my wrist said Porth	24.391958236694336
5748/28840	The devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf	271.0021057128906
5749/28840	It was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours   Oh mine replied DArtagnan was not a	53.907283782958984
5750/28840	What was it then   It was an appar	24.91813850402832
5751/28840	And   I charmed it	72.19551849365234
5752/28840	Instead of returning then by the Saint Honore gate DArtagnan who had time before him walked around and reentered by the Porte Richel	32.77073287963867
5753/28840	He was struck by a sudden	93.84541320800781
5754/28840	Ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair	183.92449951171875
5755/28840	And approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his	55.40214920043945
5756/28840	This scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound	137.82225036621094
5757/28840	It is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said DArtagnan upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors	25.52431869506836
5758/28840	He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachmans little	51.5047607421875
5759/28840	To the Palais Royal he called	14.422102928161621
5760/28840	The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his	65.3736343383789
5761/28840	The porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the	64.76478576660156
5762/28840	It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the	33.11810302734375
5763/28840	Pronounce one single word muttered DArtagnan and you are a dead	24.283935546875
5764/28840	The coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously	39.193050384521484
5765/28840	Two musketeers were pacing the court to whom DArtagnan called by their	38.31336975097656
5766/28840	The musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order	64.88211822509766
5767/28840	Then turning toward the second musketeer DArtagnan said   Monsieur du Verger help me to place this man in a place of	26.075517654418945
5768/28840	The musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was	82.98091125488281
5769/28840	DArtagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered Mazarins anter	24.57159423828125
5770/28840	Bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his	174.01060485839844
5771/28840	Everything goes on capitally my dear Monsieur Bernouin but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe	29.637359619140625
5772/28840	Where then sir   Where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be	139.08645629882812
5773/28840	We have that sir replied Bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a	57.17325973510742
5774/28840	And now my good friend said DArtagnan to him I must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and	33.55523681640625
5775/28840	The coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man DArtagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the val	39.565452575683594
5776/28840	And now Monsieur du Verger he said shut yourself up with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the	35.50444412231445
5777/28840	The duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing I know but added he seriously you understand it is on the kings	70.60611724853516
5778/28840	At your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious	87.56690216064453
5779/28840	Bythebye continued DArtagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his	65.02539825439453
5780/28840	The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and DArtagnan went out followed by Bernou	33.58911895751953
5781/28840	Lead me into the queens oratory said DArtagnan announce to her I am here and put this parcel with a wellloaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private	35.17118453979492
5782/28840	Bernouin conducted DArtagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensive	33.36759567260742
5783/28840	Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais	37.90050506591797
5784/28840	As we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at Cours la Re	57.63351821899414
5785/28840	At ten oclock Anne of Austria had entered the kings	23.471033096313477
5786/28840	Monsieur had just retired and the youthful Louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him	177.0083770751953
5787/28840	Two royal pages were playing with	245.37582397460938
5788/28840	Laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to	40.04399871826172
5789/28840	The king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was	185.84909057617188

5794/28840	Laporte said Anne of Austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress	58.705291748046875
5795/28840	The king went out accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own	39.0566291809082
5796/28840	When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her	170.52919006347656
5797/28840	Madame de Motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress	108.60862731933594
5798/28840	The queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed	77.44392395019531
5799/28840	It was at this moment DArtagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutors carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladiesinwaiting drove out and the gates were shut after	35.10645294189453
5800/28840	A few minutes after twelve oclock Bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door having come by the cardinals secret	56.28501892089844
5801/28840	Anne of Austria opened the door to him	120.7498779296875

5806/28840	The queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of Venetian crystal She saw DArtagnan who stood expecting	41.49049377441406
5807/28840	Are you ready   I	15.332145690917969

5811/28840	The young Louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming Laporte with questions who replied only in these words Sire it is by the queens	67.30870056152344
5812/28840	The bedclothes were thrown back exposing the kings bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be	123.52651977539062
5813/28840	It was one of the results of Mazarins niggard	26.733226776123047
5814/28840	The queen entered and DArtagnan remained at the	26.66504669189453
5815/28840	As soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet	47.105525970458984

5820/28840	The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed	40.09886932373047
5821/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan repeated Louis very well mad	39.24509048461914
5822/28840	At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were	77.89642333984375
5823/28840	Oh oh replied DArtagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in	60.50935363769531

5830/28840	We are about to ascertain sire replied DArtagnan as he rapidly left the	33.84049606323242
5831/28840	The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal	92.76530456542969
5832/28840	Cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the	49.974246978759766
5833/28840	It was evident that there was clamor and sed	70.56892395019531
5834/28840	The king half dressed the queen and Laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and	75.31189727783203
5835/28840	Comminges who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal ran	49.452762603759766

5838/28840	DArtagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue some violent	37.571346282958984
5839/28840	He approached her and said in a low voice   Has your majesty still confidence in me   This voice startled	40.11783218383789

5843/28840	Comminges glanced at DArtagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring	66.7651596069336
5844/28840	DArtagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious	31.45223045349121
5845/28840	Monsieur de Comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we not It is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this	83.76954650878906

5858/28840	Sire said DArtagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question   Louis	21.11557960510254
5859/28840	turned around astonished that any one should dare to address	188.11758422851562
5860/28840	But the queen pressed the childs	75.59562683105469
5861/28840	Does your majesty remember when playing in the park of Fontainebleau or in the palace courts at Versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder   Yes	92.78357696533203

5870/28840	Laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we might be off during the	66.16837310791016

5872/28840	Not at all said DArtagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be	66.32966613769531
5873/28840	You are right sir always right said Anne of	70.21631622314453
5874/28840	Laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the	60.53893280029297

5881/28840	Laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst DArtagnan glided behind the	36.869869232177734
5882/28840	Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her	67.48555755615234
5883/28840	On seeing the queen the men stopped short	344.78936767578125
5884/28840	There was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like	252.64535522460938
5885/28840	They had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the	116.78387451171875
5886/28840	The gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his	143.63229370117188
5887/28840	The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall	136.67063903808594
5888/28840	Enter gentlemen said Laporte since the queen desires you so to	76.488037109375
5889/28840	Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tipt	50.0137939453125
5890/28840	This example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted court	79.023193359375
5891/28840	Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and	75.95098114013672
5892/28840	DArtagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized Planc	39.15082931518555
5893/28840	Sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to you	46.54553985595703
5894/28840	Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run	86.60137176513672
5895/28840	No certainly replied Planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon	78.31134796142578
5896/28840	You will say then to my good and faithful Parisians continued Anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive DArtagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to	48.197505950927734
5897/28840	I shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but   But what asked Anne of	36.306331634521484
5898/28840	Will your majesty pardon me said Planchet but is it really the king who is lying there   Anne of Austria	46.1274299621582
5899/28840	If she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying	97.73196411132812
5900/28840	A man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and	42.73762512207031
5901/28840	For one second DArtagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and DArtagnan recognized the coadj	31.246440887451172
5902/28840	It is certainly the king said the man rising	147.57725524902344
5903/28840	God bless his majesty   Yes repeated the leader in a whisper God bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their	103.86700439453125
5904/28840	Now said Planchet let us thank the	40.941410064697266
5905/28840	They all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had	79.87299346923828
5906/28840	Planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to	33.82860565185547
5907/28840	What is your name my friend she	40.37421798706055
5908/28840	Planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned	175.8612518310547
5909/28840	Yes continued the queen I think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and I wish to know your	39.707393646240234
5910/28840	Yes thought Planchet to treat me as a	50.3927001953125
5911/28840	DArtagnan trembled lest Planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that Planchet had belonged to	40.468597412109375
5912/28840	Madame replied Planchet respectfully I am called Dulaurier at your	29.61051368713379
5913/28840	Thank you Monsieur Dulaurier said the queen and what is your business   Madame I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonna	27.827030181884766
5914/28840	That is all I wished to know said the	28.299421310424805
5915/28840	Come come thought DArtagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good	41.85688400268555
5916/28840	DArtagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying Let us	37.21316909790039
5917/28840	Well asked the queen   Well madame replied the valet I followed them as far as the	27.97804832458496
5918/28840	They announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and	50.434566497802734
5919/28840	Oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is I who promise	64.03767395019531
5920/28840	Then turning to DArtagnan she said   Sir you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever	24.072925567626953
5921/28840	Continue and say what we must do	182.04080200195312
5922/28840	Monsieur Laporte said DArtagnan finish dressing his	29.642475128173828
5923/28840	We may go then asked the	60.333892822265625
5924/28840	You have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the	36.102962493896484
5925/28840	Go sir said the queen I will follow	24.749984741210938

5927/28840	DArtagnan took out the parcel which he had desired Bernouin to place under the	36.02827835083008
5928/28840	It may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondys coach	30.992143630981445
5929/28840	He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the	42.50750732421875
5930/28840	Sir said DArtagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coach	31.32880210876465
5931/28840	If when you arrive at Cours la Reine you find no one you must go on to Saint Germ	27.617074966430664
5932/28840	The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus	115.59745788574219
5933/28840	DArtagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind	40.829551696777344
5934/28840	The queen appeared and was followed by the king and the Duke dAnjou his	105.31980895996094
5935/28840	Monsieur the coadjutors carriage she exclaimed falling	51.4295654296875
5936/28840	Yes madame said DArtagnan but get in fearlessly for I myself will drive	33.756256103515625
5937/28840	The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her	27.940399169921875
5938/28840	How madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties   It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings	32.9365234375
5939/28840	But will that not excite suspicion sir asked the	77.00997924804688
5940/28840	Your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer I have my answer	73.00778198242188
5941/28840	The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue Richel	33.75450897216797
5942/28840	On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his	44.5892448425293
5943/28840	DArtagnan signed to them to draw	32.86028289794922
5944/28840	Do you recognize the carriage he asked the	105.91822814941406
5945/28840	The sergeant put the lantern near the	253.57708740234375
5946/28840	They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he	15.546805381774902
5947/28840	Hush he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemen	78.04607391357422
5948/28840	I know who it is Then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said   I wish you joy my lord   Impudent fellow cried DArtagnan you will get me turned	37.7952880859375
5949/28840	The gate groaned on its hinges and DArtagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the	58.57096481323242
5950/28840	Mousqueton exclaimed DArtagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys	21.559602737426758
5951/28840	And driving the coadjutors carriage said the	40.55535888671875
5952/28840	Corpo di Dio Monsieur dArtagnan said Mazarin you are worth your weight in	48.064048767089844
5953/28840	How DArtagnan and Porthos earned by selling	17.613468170166016
5954/28840	Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet	63.81119155883789
5955/28840	However she offered the cardinal Laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the	88.41341400146484
5956/28840	It was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave Paris by night had been	87.10115051269531
5957/28840	Ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being	102.085693359375
5958/28840	The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the Prince de Condé with the princess and dowager	64.49181365966797
5959/28840	Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was	36.43091583251953
5960/28840	The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbé de la Riviere and the third the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti brother and brotherinlaw of Cond	29.272846221923828
5961/28840	They all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their	46.939693450927734
5962/28840	The queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said   But where is Madame de Longueville   Ah yes where is my sister asked the	32.54194641113281
5963/28840	Madame de Longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your	33.57206344604492
5964/28840	Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his	33.82518768310547
5965/28840	What do you say of this asked the	26.23756980895996
5966/28840	I say that she is a hostage for the Parisians answered the	37.56963348388672
5967/28840	Why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his	73.98466491699219
5968/28840	Silence whispered the duke she has her	246.8498077392578
5969/28840	She will ruin us returned the	175.2045440673828
5970/28840	Carriages now arrived in crowds those of the Marechal de Villeroy Guitant Villequier and Comminges came into the	39.237396240234375
5971/28840	The two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of DArtagnan and Porthos in their	21.026796340942383
5972/28840	These two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing DArtagnan on the coachbox of the royal	57.69530487060547
5973/28840	Mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like Automedon of	81.45774841308594
5974/28840	The queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the Gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the	78.68321990966797
5975/28840	Let us be the avant guard said he to Porthos and find good quarters at Saint Germain nobody will think of us and for my part I am greatly fatig	60.64043045043945
5976/28840	As for me replied Porthos I am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the Parisians are	67.66606903076172
5977/28840	Or rather we are very clever said DArtagn	45.19011306762695
5978/28840	The queens voice she is speaking said Porthos I think she wants to ride on horse	63.22069549560547
5979/28840	Oh she would like it but   But what   The cardinal wont allow	54.44818878173828

5981/28840	DArtagnan started off for Saint Germain followed by Porth	11.485270500183105
5982/28840	We will go on gentlemen said the	51.83662414550781

5984/28840	They reached Saint German without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bareheaded to offer her his	160.3721466064453
5985/28840	What an awakening for the Parisians said the queen	95.84613037109375
5986/28840	Well then let it be war Have we not on our side the conqueror of Rocroy of Nordlingen of Lens   The prince bowed	57.95029067993164
5987/28840	It was then three oclock in the	23.91588020324707
5988/28840	The queen walked first every one followed	830.1360473632812
5989/28840	About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her	165.63034057617188
5990/28840	Am Iam I then to sleep on the floor asked Gaston dOrleans with a forced	129.0533905029297
5991/28840	No my prince replied Mazarin the third bed is intended for your high	79.47269439697266
5992/28840	I answered Mazarin I shall not sleep at all I have work to	39.22113037109375
5993/28840	Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to rep	79.22599029541016
5994/28840	Well for my part I shall go to bed said DArtagnan come Porth	20.876462936401367
5995/28840	Porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his	68.91069793701172
5996/28840	They walked from one end of the chateau to the other Porthos looking with wondering eyes at DArtagnan who was counting on his	31.54622459411621
5997/28840	Four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pist	109.28099822998047
5998/28840	Yes interposed Porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles   A pistole is not enough said DArtagnan tis worth a lou	18.557781219482422
5999/28840	What is worth a louis   Four hundred at a louis each make four hundred lou	55.75656509399414
6000/28840	Yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four	67.73683166503906
6001/28840	But four hundred what   Listen cried DArtagn	33.1054801940918
6002/28840	But as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friends	44.45341110229492
6003/28840	Isnt Mousqueton there   But he wears my livery my livery will be known replied Porth	38.346824645996094
6004/28840	He can turn his coat inside	347.0279235839844
6005/28840	You are always in the right my dear friend cried Porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice   DArtagnan	26.83609962463379
6006/28840	The two friends turned down the first street they came	64.7510757446289
6007/28840	Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst DArtagnan knocked at the door of a house to the	15.310877799987793
6008/28840	Sir we dont keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay	141.1859130859375
6009/28840	Where is the hay dealers   At the last large door in the	36.92176055908203
6010/28840	Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw   Yes theres the landlord of the Lamb and GrosLouis the farmer they both live in the Rue des Ursul	59.41181945800781
6011/28840	DArtagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles	41.481658935546875
6012/28840	He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same	65.25531768798828
6013/28840	Finally Farmer Louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and	300.2760925292969
6014/28840	There was no more to be had in Saint Germ	44.29948043823242
6015/28840	This foraging did not occupy more than half an	101.05133819580078
6016/28840	Mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new	101.02315521240234
6017/28840	He was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty lou	63.64818572998047
6018/28840	DArtagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans on their camp	38.35736846923828
6019/28840	Straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found   I can show you answered the Gas	77.13507843017578
6020/28840	And he conducted them to Mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis	38.648311614990234
6021/28840	At five oclock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be	25.546186447143555
6022/28840	DArtagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own	42.81456756591797
6023/28840	Mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him	23.605363845825195
6024/28840	DArtagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen lou	43.80949020385742
6025/28840	Porthos however found that he had no straw left for	72.18997192382812
6026/28840	He returned to Mousqueton but the steward had sold the last w	42.766727447509766
6027/28840	DArtagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that Porthos should share his couch with	50.62319564819336
6028/28840	He laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under	75.38612365722656
6029/28840	He was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him	41.25728225708008
6030/28840	Here cried Porthos here   Porthos foresaw that if DArtagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the	24.667299270629883

6038/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him I have not forgotten with what zeal you have served	21.381790161132812

6070/28840	DArtagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawn	34.35269546508789

6122/28840	I did think of it but this letter has neither date nor post	68.41803741455078
6123/28840	And he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabb	53.97395324707031

6131/28840	On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis the friends found a vast concourse of	89.83968353271484
6132/28840	It was the Duc de Beaufort who was coming from the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians intoxicated with	30.866310119628906
6133/28840	With the dukes aid they already considered themselves	284.4993896484375

6192/28840	In that case I can give you	50.76023864746094
6193/28840	No sir said DArtagnan and we place ourselves at your	29.68988609313965
6194/28840	Well gentlemen resumed Mordaunt we must set out without delay today is the last day granted me by the	67.01771545410156
6195/28840	My ship is ready and had you not come I must have set off without you for General Cromwell expects my return impatient	107.09854888916016
6196/28840	So thought the lieutenant tis to General Cromwell that our dispatches are	76.70352172851562
6197/28840	Have you no letter for him asked the young	62.95950698852539
6198/28840	I have one the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till	55.84005355834961
6199/28840	DArtagnan tore open the envelope of the	19.756288528442383
6200/28840	It was directed to Monsieur Oliver Cromwell General of the Army of the English	50.22429656982422
6201/28840	Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell inquired Porth	16.892101287841797
6202/28840	Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said Porth	51.37417221069336
6203/28840	Come come gentlemen said Mordaunt impatiently let us	77.86475372314453
6204/28840	What exclaimed Porthos without supper Cannot Monsieur Cromwell wait a little   Yes but I said Mord	29.52260971069336
6205/28840	Well you said Porthos what then   I cannot	30.215837478637695
6206/28840	Oh as to you that is not my concern and I shall sup either with or without your	93.23439025878906
6207/28840	The young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained	95.01939392089844
6208/28840	Monsieur said DArtagnan you must excuse famished	29.073026657104492
6209/28840	Besides our supper cant delay you	1574.2086181640625
6210/28840	We will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the	74.4694595336914
6211/28840	We will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you	47.37293243408203
6212/28840	Just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he	181.73956298828125
6213/28840	The name of your ship inquired DArtagn	27.93490982055664
6214/28840	Very well in half an hour we shall be on	43.16408920288086
6215/28840	And the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the Arms of	104.39366912841797
6216/28840	What do you say of that young man asked DArtagnan as they hurried	26.05489730834961
6217/28840	I say that he doesnt suit me at all said Porthos and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramiss	39.217254638671875
6218/28840	By no means my dear Porthos that man is a messenger of General Cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception I imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confid	64.21183776855469
6219/28840	Nevertheless said Porthos I have always noticed that Aramis gives good	44.01005172729492
6220/28840	Listen returned DArtagnan when our embassy is finished   Well   If it brings us back to France   Well   Well we shall	29.479318618774414
6221/28840	At that moment the two friends reached the hotel Arms of England where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the	63.96122360229492
6222/28840	There they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatient	74.50330352783203
6223/28840	It is singular said DArtagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known but who it was I cannot yet	73.08795928955078
6224/28840	A few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised	59.115238189697266
6225/28840	The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be	164.02151489257812
6226/28840	Porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to	103.8836441040039
6227/28840	DArtagnan overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him	46.48196029663086
6228/28840	There placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland but still on English soil the tents of a little army	87.44651794433594
6229/28840	The moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that Charles	42.755615234375
6230/28840	had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some	81.6787109375
6231/28840	About fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a Scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire	106.9780502319336
6232/28840	The former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first caval	87.46762084960938
6233/28840	In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting	74.78787231445312
6234/28840	Well my dear friend said he in as pure French as has ever been uttered between Rouen and	122.93621063232422
6235/28840	Well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know	78.70272827148438
6236/28840	Why what is the matter   It would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin	74.44943237304688
6237/28840	We must go and find Lord	100.45115661621094
6238/28840	They both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking	53.29175567626953
6239/28840	Tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of anter	45.57162094116211
6240/28840	However you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the	79.3652114868164
6241/28840	Lord Winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy	136.97015380859375
6242/28840	The two friends approached Winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his	59.938377380371094
6243/28840	He turned around recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to	23.00737762451172
6244/28840	Have you observed said he to them what a bloodred color the moon has tonight   No replied Athos I thought it looked much the same as	102.13496398925781
6245/28840	I must own said Aramis I am like the Comte de la FereI can see nothing remarkable about	25.097848892211914
6246/28840	My lord said Athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the	83.87174987792969
6247/28840	Have you studied our Scotch troops and have you confidence in them   The Scotch inquired	154.7809295654297
6248/28840	What Scotch   Ours egad exclaimed Ath	49.96015548706055
6249/28840	Those in whom the king has confidedLord Levens High	44.1727294921875
6250/28840	No said Winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens   Not the least in the world said Aramis and Athos at	68.31134033203125
6251/28840	Tell me continued Winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in France that Henry	120.04476165771484
6252/28840	the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with	54.07645797729492
6253/28840	de Bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard   Yes said Athos and the marechal has often told me so	47.85468673706055
6254/28840	Then it was so murmured Winter and the next day Henry	57.266929626464844
6255/28840	But what has this vision of Henry	90.7248764038086
6256/28840	to do with you my lord inquired Aram	38.807098388671875
6257/28840	Nothing and indeed I am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important	73.46665954589844
6258/28840	Yes my lord said Athos I wish to speak to the	14.506017684936523
6259/28840	To the king but the king is	53.8790397644043
6260/28840	I have something important to reveal to	76.06819915771484
6261/28840	Can it not be put off till tomorrow   He must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too	53.23432159423828
6262/28840	Lord Winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the	41.55863571166992
6263/28840	This corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful	171.73583984375
6264/28840	These gentlemen are with me said	392.3088073730469
6265/28840	The lackey bowed and let them	47.07021713256836
6266/28840	As he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and	94.82426452636719
6267/28840	They advanced and Athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by	81.8100357055664
6268/28840	Athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he	505.8632507324219
6269/28840	Ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you Comte de la Fere   Yes sire replied Ath	14.981536865234375
6270/28840	You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news   Alas sire answered Athos your majesty has guessed ar	51.326473236083984
6271/28840	It is bad news   Yes s	28.614192962646484
6272/28840	You never come to me without conferring	78.99136352539062
6273/28840	You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by Henrietta whatever news you bring speak	124.52568054199219
6274/28840	Sire Cromwell has arrived this night at	220.62594604492188
6275/28840	Ah exclaimed the king to fight   No sire but to buy your	45.04037094116211
6276/28840	What did you say   I said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the Scottish	47.081207275390625
6277/28840	For unpaid wages yes I know	209.70289611816406
6278/28840	For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor	139.2427520751953
6279/28840	Well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing	70.01094055175781
6280/28840	Impossible cried the king the Scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds And who is the Judas who has concluded this infamous bargain   Lord Le	69.25064086914062
6281/28840	Are you certain of it sir   I heard it with my own	33.63131332397461
6282/28840	The king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his	83.31005859375
6283/28840	To cross the Tyne reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose who will not sell	47.6093635559082
6284/28840	And what shall I do in Scotland A war of partisans unworthy of a	157.2410125732422
6285/28840	The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you s	75.52864074707031
6286/28840	No no I have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their	112.54562377929688
6287/28840	Sire said Athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a	137.24658203125
6288/28840	I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in London and I say to you Live sireit is the will of	39.5927734375
6289/28840	I would confide my life to them but I should hesitate ere I trusted them with your majest	37.36821746826172
6290/28840	Well said Athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted	56.227745056152344
6291/28840	Let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us we will cross the Tyne reach Scotland and you will be	38.544105529785156
6292/28840	Is this your counsel also Winter inquired the	521.3887939453125
6293/28840	And yours Monsieur dHerblay   Yes s	9.359574317932129
6294/28840	Winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his	106.39226531982422
6295/28840	The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter reentered	88.94158935546875
6296/28840	Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses ready sadd	125.8433837890625
6297/28840	In that case exclaimed Athos let us not lose an instant but set	44.36400604248047
6298/28840	Sire said Aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this   Friends answered Charles sadly I have but threeone of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a weeks standing whom I shall never	87.33700561523438
6299/28840	Come gentlemen come   The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for	54.405487060546875
6300/28840	It was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very	54.74747848510742
6301/28840	The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing	115.15557098388672
6302/28840	Ah said the king I was unjust here is a creature that loves	91.34109497070312
6303/28840	You at least will be faithful to me	69.76686096191406
6304/28840	The horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the kings face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with	119.60315704345703
6305/28840	Yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my Arthur thou art a fond and faithful	88.20977020263672
6306/28840	After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to Athos Aramis and Winter said   Now gentlemen I am at your	40.47370910644531
6307/28840	But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the	37.67237091064453
6308/28840	What is that line cried Athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demitints of day	104.6646728515625
6309/28840	What is that line I did not observe it	97.16163635253906
6310/28840	It must be the fog rising from the river said the	78.57178497314453
6311/28840	Sire it is something more opaque than the	108.2094497680664
6312/28840	Indeed said Winter it appears to me like a bar of red	129.77859497070312
6313/28840	It is the enemy who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed Ath	140.71295166015625
6314/28840	Stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the Ironsides   This was the name given the cuirassiers whom Cromwell had made his body	61.45781326293945
6315/28840	Ah said the king we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betrayed me or	41.05073165893555
6316/28840	What are you going to do exclaimed Ath	22.421586990356445
6317/28840	To give them the order to charge and run down these miserable	225.6170196533203
6318/28840	And the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of Lord Le	58.67198181152344
6319/28840	Is the king wounded cried Lord	372.6602783203125
6320/28840	I see spots of blood on the	64.29913330078125
6321/28840	And he set off to follow the two	71.77958679199219
6322/28840	Go and call out your regiment said he I can foresee that we shall have need of it	75.5438461303711
6323/28840	Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode	31.798791885375977
6324/28840	It had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander he dismounted and	71.89012145996094
6325/28840	The general was there surrounded by the more prominent	92.2119140625
6326/28840	The king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilder	1432.41552734375
6327/28840	Charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding	50.134483337402344
6328/28840	Yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has	60.067874908447266
6329/28840	What is the matter sire exclaimed Lord Le	32.167022705078125
6330/28840	Of this treaty at least I have been	139.44041442871094
6331/28840	This is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for I stand here to accuse	152.69192504882812
6332/28840	Sire said Lord Leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false	72.76154327392578
6333/28840	My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and Scotland and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the clauses of the treaty	75.25466918945312
6334/28840	The Scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brow	46.8119010925293
6335/28840	Sire murmured Lord Leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our	97.63782501220703
6336/28840	I ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the	114.00679779052734
6337/28840	That cannot be sire said the ear	127.19171142578125
6338/28840	How cannot be What hinders it exclaimed the	175.9134979248047
6339/28840	Your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the English	42.25200653076172
6340/28840	And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it	144.43048095703125
6341/28840	Yes said they we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from him who for the last fiveandtwenty years has sucked the blood and gold of Scotland and	64.26504516601562
6342/28840	We have promised and we will keep our	89.30195617675781
6343/28840	And both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other	82.50386810302734
6344/28840	Aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his	32.309661865234375
6345/28840	On their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his	81.40020751953125
6346/28840	The king motioned him to accompany	98.19483184814453
6347/28840	They all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of	330.8071594238281
6348/28840	The king threw himself into an arm	38.52620315551758
6349/28840	Betrayed yes betrayed by the Scotch amongst whom I was born whom I have always loved better than the	165.7471923828125
6350/28840	Oh traitors that ye are   Sire said Athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a	41.378822326660156
6351/28840	Up sire up for you have here at least three men who will not betray	86.02996826171875
6352/28840	Ah if we had been five murmured Athos thinking of DArtagnan and Porth	17.585739135742188
6353/28840	What do you say inquired Charles	106.06448364257812
6354/28840	I say sire that there is now but one way	65.11510467529297
6355/28840	Let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings	97.45623779296875
6356/28840	Whilst they pursue him the king might	472.28033447265625
6357/28840	It is good advice said Athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to	54.36054611206055
6358/28840	What do you think of this counsel Winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed	74.10357666015625
6359/28840	I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by Monsieur dHerbl	20.222389221191406
6360/28840	I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to	54.540382385253906
6361/28840	But if I accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my	99.03390502929688
6362/28840	He will have had the glory of having saved his king cried	152.14698791503906
6363/28840	It is right said Athos he has served your majesty longer than we	74.36839294433594
6364/28840	The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his	49.855506896972656
6365/28840	Wait a moment sir said he I have an order for each of you	84.79204559326172
6366/28840	He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the Order of the G	47.133880615234375
6367/28840	These cannot be for us said Ath	92.8484115600586
6368/28840	Such are for royalty and we are simple common	283.412109375
6369/28840	I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as	107.97225952148438
6370/28840	No no you do yourselves injustice but I am here to do you	70.70884704589844
6371/28840	Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula I make you a	93.22501373291016
6372/28840	Be brave faithful and loyal he said You are brave faithful and	194.0451202392578
6373/28840	Then turning to Aramis he said   It is now your turn monsieur le cheval	13.742670059204102
6374/28840	The same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the	79.97944641113281
6375/28840	Charles having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos embraced them	149.87603759765625
6376/28840	Sire said Winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are	209.28143310546875
6377/28840	The king looked at the three	84.45370483398438
6378/28840	Flying through an army sire said Athos in all countries in the world is called	60.3650016784668
6379/28840	Then I shall die sword in hand said	352.07086181640625
6380/28840	Monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever I am king   Sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our	47.03307342529297
6381/28840	The king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with Winter and went	291.4273681640625
6382/28840	Winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the	362.1523742675781
6383/28840	The king followed by the three friends turned his steps that	131.78712463378906
6384/28840	The Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle	102.48005676269531
6385/28840	Do you see that said the	42.990596771240234
6386/28840	Perhaps they are penitent and preparing to	111.31688690185547
6387/28840	If they are penitent said Athos let them follow	47.08942413330078
6388/28840	Well said the king what shall we do   Let us examine the enemys	27.85828971862793
6389/28840	At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of	68.8247299194336
6390/28840	The air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the	146.79751586914062
6391/28840	The regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly	118.26752471923828
6392/28840	On the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by	160.04159545898438
6393/28840	He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king	105.44579315185547
6394/28840	Does this man know your majesty personally inquired Aram	178.24343872070312
6395/28840	Then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the	92.5873031616211
6396/28840	Ah said Athos how much time we have	51.131649017333984
6397/28840	Now said the king give the word and let us	86.55055236816406
6398/28840	Will you not give it sire asked Ath	102.10565185546875
6399/28840	No I make you my lieutenantgeneral said the	82.93157958984375
6400/28840	What we are going to say does not concern your	28.42536163330078
6401/28840	The king smiling turned a few steps	354.9504699707031
6402/28840	This is what I propose to do said Ath	23.953571319580078
6403/28840	We will divide our regiments into two squad	77.275634765625
6404/28840	You will put yourself at the head of the	25.033889770507812
6405/28840	We and his majesty will lead the	90.1761703491211
6406/28840	Once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the	126.03308868408203
6407/28840	To horse reechoed Athos everything is arranged and	138.84254455566406
6408/28840	Now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of France Montjoy and	144.73223876953125
6409/28840	Denis The war cry of England is too often in the mouths of tra	105.5615463256836
6410/28840	They mountedthe king on Winters horse and Winter on that of the king then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left at the head of the	49.43749237060547
6411/28840	The Scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these	164.5660400390625
6412/28840	Some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in	43.70439529418945
6413/28840	There said the king that consoles me they are not all tra	47.611351013183594
6414/28840	At this moment Winters voice was raised with the cry of Forward   The first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the	69.84635162353516
6415/28840	A regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward	109.14700317382812
6416/28840	Sire said Athos we foresaw this and if Lord Winters men but do their duty we are saved instead of	100.38569641113281
6417/28840	At this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses Winters voice crying out   Sword in hand   At these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like	62.52900695800781
6418/28840	Now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand   But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings	94.33008575439453
6419/28840	We are betrayed said the king in a low	36.882877349853516
6420/28840	Wait a moment said Athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their	44.41325759887695
6421/28840	Have they not heard that of their colonel But look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of Athoss	75.85785675048828
6422/28840	Ah cowards traitors screamed Lord Winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the	187.93263244628906
6423/28840	About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of Cromwells cuirass	44.82759094238281
6424/28840	Let us go and die with them said the	51.822059631347656
6425/28840	Let us go said Athos and Aram	18.0379695892334
6426/28840	All faithful hearts with me cried out	959.0543212890625
6427/28840	This voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gall	31.961868286132812
6428/28840	No quarter cried a voice in French answering to that of Winter which made them trem	123.02645874023438
6429/28840	As for Winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were pet	54.3521728515625
6430/28840	It was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the English regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in	51.044254302978516
6431/28840	Tis he murmured Winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his	47.46976089477539
6432/28840	The king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of Winter take him	211.0099639892578
6433/28840	No it is not the king exclaimed the caval	32.47429656982422
6434/28840	Lord Winter you are not the king you are my	66.80120849609375
6435/28840	Wretch exclaimed Aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go	75.9246597290039
6436/28840	At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two French	58.506370544433594
6437/28840	Athos after making sure that Lord Winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said   Come Aramis now for the honor of France and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally	74.79782104492188
6438/28840	At the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their	83.63855743408203
6439/28840	DArt exclaimed Athos whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with his	34.76988220214844
6440/28840	I am your prisoner said Aramis giving up his sword to Porth	27.556440353393555
6441/28840	Fire fire cried Mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two	69.8171157836914
6442/28840	And wherefore fire said the colonel every one has	296.52471923828125
6443/28840	It is the son of Milady said Athos to DArtagn	13.011819839477539
6444/28840	It is the monk whispered Porthos to Aram	27.523353576660156
6445/28840	And now the ranks began to	317.9197082519531
6446/28840	DArtagnan held the bridle of Athoss horse and Porthos that of Aram	14.917651176452637
6447/28840	Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the	148.91859436035156
6448/28840	This movement revealed the spot where Winters body had	110.98059844970703
6449/28840	Mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant	130.07398986816406
6450/28840	Athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet	365.1146240234375
6451/28840	We are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize	128.9213409423828
6452/28840	Then turning to the young man he exclaimed   A fine prize a fine prize friend Mordaunt we have both myself and Monsieur du Vallon taken two Knights of the Garter nothing	34.92638397216797
6453/28840	But said Mordaunt looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes these are Frenchmen I	38.20513153076172
6454/28840	Are you French sir said he to Ath	42.38447189331055
6455/28840	Very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow country	63.6980094909668
6456/28840	But the kingwhere is the king exclaimed Athos anx	61.492462158203125
6457/28840	DArtagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying   Eh the king We have secured	59.83340835571289
6458/28840	Yes said Aramis through an infamous act of	72.46501922607422
6459/28840	The king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty	404.3717346191406
6460/28840	He appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty	87.36332702636719
6461/28840	Drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from	61.380348205566406
6462/28840	Behold Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old Puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the	50.91431427001953
6463/28840	Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar said Mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is Charles the First the king the good King Charles who despoils his subjects to enrich	72.64897155761719
6464/28840	Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize	93.72801208496094
6465/28840	Nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mord	174.66485595703125
6466/28840	Bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by DArtagnan and Porth	24.572092056274414
6467/28840	The day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank God But where is my old friend Winter   The two gentlemen turned away their heads in	69.36820220947266
6468/28840	The demon had known how to wound	433.17083740234375
6469/28840	The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and	92.414306640625
6470/28840	He saw a corpse at his	81.20269012451172
6471/28840	He uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised Winters head and unfastening the Order of the Saint Esprit placed it on his own	37.599151611328125
6472/28840	Lord Winter is killed then inquired DArtagnan fixing his eyes on the	30.596193313598633
6473/28840	Yes said Athos by his own	36.5151252746582
6474/28840	Come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said DArtagn	55.726078033447266
6475/28840	Charles Stuart said the colonel of the English regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner   Colonel Tomlison said Charles kings cannot yield the man alone submits to	71.74112701416016
6476/28840	The king drew his sword and broke it on his	59.66713333129883
6477/28840	At this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was	91.89981842041016
6478/28840	The king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the	95.54601287841797
6479/28840	Now gentlemen said he conduct me where you	110.94319152832031
6480/28840	Turning back again he said I thought I saw Winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon	161.25474548339844
6481/28840	Never fear King Charles said Mordaunt the bullet pierced his	198.31324768066406
6482/28840	Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or Porthos said DArtagnan to Athos and Aramis that you recognize this man for Milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this	42.8607292175293
6483/28840	The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from Cromwell sent orders that Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby	120.1053466796875
6484/28840	At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver Crom	70.26219940185547
6485/28840	Have you been to the general said Mordaunt to DArtagnan and Porthos you know he sent for you after the	41.150054931640625
6486/28840	We want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied DArtagn	37.705047607421875
6487/28840	Do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds   Oh be assured said Mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well I promise	74.66337585449219
6488/28840	I shall take better care of them myself answered DArtagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt	72.04894256591797
6489/28840	I will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his em	33.809932708740234
6490/28840	You think of starting at once then inquired Mord	90.14010620117188
6491/28840	Our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were	47.72962951660156
6492/28840	The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant   You will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town	60.339332580566406
6493/28840	The sergeant made a sign of	103.12855529785156
6494/28840	Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent	91.21634674072266
6495/28840	Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young	35.44285202026367
6496/28840	Mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw Cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being	180.1961669921875
6497/28840	Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered Cromwell did not	85.64375305175781
6498/28840	At last after a few moments Cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly	51.24875259399414
6499/28840	I said I wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young	51.217899322509766
6500/28840	They thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it I am ready to	62.169090270996094
6501/28840	Ah is it you Mordaunt said Cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may	80.08695220947266
6502/28840	To congratulate mewhat for   On the capture of Charles	64.68204498291016
6503/28840	I was much more really so two hours	233.2582244873047
6504/28840	How so general   Because England had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is	123.95813751220703
6505/28840	Have you seen him   Yes	31.558412551879883
6506/28840	What is his bearing   Mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the	47.796852111816406
6507/28840	What did he say   Some parting words to his	55.88435363769531
6508/28840	Has he any friends Then he added aloud Did he make any resistance   No sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of	100.3211898803711
6509/28840	To whom did he give up his sword   He did not give it up he broke	40.14447021484375
6510/28840	He did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more	98.29771423339844
6511/28840	I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed said Cromwell staring very fixedly at Mord	86.04781341552734
6512/28840	What was his name   Lord	34.14958953857422
6513/28840	My uncle answered Mordaunt but traitors to England are no longer members of my	99.34355926513672
6514/28840	Cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy Shakespeare describes so well   Mordaunt he said you are a terrible	55.01445770263672
6515/28840	When the Lord commands said Mordaunt His commands are not to be	170.91375732421875
6516/28840	Abraham raised the knife against Isaac and Isaac was his	256.33935546875
6517/28840	Yes said Cromwell but the Lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be	90.15227508544922
6518/28840	I have looked around me said Mordaunt and I have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the	73.36132049560547
6519/28840	You are strong among the strong Mordaunt he said and the Frenchmen how did they behave   Most fear	90.39495849609375
6520/28840	Yes yes murmured Cromwell the French fight well and if my glass was good and I mistake not they were foremost in the	92.74248504638672
6521/28840	It was the fault of their horses not	219.10845947265625
6522/28840	And the Scotch   They kept their word and never stirred said Mord	99.91249084472656
6523/28840	Wretched men   Their officers wish to see you	117.99646759033203
6524/28840	I have no time to see	21.176231384277344
6525/28840	Are they paid   Yes	167.08236694335938
6526/28840	Let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough I have nothing more to do with them nor they with	105.2328109741211
6527/28840	Before I go said Mordaunt I have some questions and a favor to ask you	66.0046615600586
6528/28840	A favor from me   Mordaunt	48.26071548461914
6529/28840	I come to you my leader my head my father and I ask you master are you contented with me   Cromwell looked at him with aston	31.104732513427734
6530/28840	Yes said Cromwell you have done since I knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave	40.08835220336914
6531/28840	Do you remember sir it was my idea the Scotch treaty for giving up the king   Yes the idea was	98.92667388916016
6532/28840	I had no such contempt for men	255.6223602294922
6533/28840	Was I not a good ambassador in France   Yes for Mazarin has granted what I	72.75932312011719
6534/28840	Have I not always fought for your glory and interests   Too ardently perhaps it is what I have just reproached you	53.942264556884766
6535/28840	But what is the meaning of all these questions   To tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these	33.27006912231445
6536/28840	Oh said Oliver with a slight curl of his lip I forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been	126.1402359008789
6537/28840	Sir I can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my	49.01923751831055
6538/28840	How is that   I have the payment under my hand I almost possess	98.34614562988281
6539/28840	What is it Have they offered you money Do you wish a step or some place in the government   Sir will you grant me my request   Let us hear what it is	63.698951721191406
6540/28840	Well then said Cromwell I promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request	91.69994354248047
6541/28840	Sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them   For their ransom have they then offered a large one inquired Crom	126.97537994384766
6542/28840	On the contrary I think they are poor	103.22306060791016
6543/28840	They are friends of yours then   Yes sir exclaimed Mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and I would lay down my life for	61.031585693359375
6544/28840	Very well Mordaunt exclaimed Cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more I will give them to you I will not even ask who they are do as you like with	88.0145263671875
6545/28840	Thank you sir exclaimed Mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should I lose it I should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my	62.34305191040039
6546/28840	He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed	34.3297233581543
6547/28840	What said Cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more you wish neither gold nor rank   You have given me all you can give me and from today your debt is	85.46580505371094
6548/28840	And Mordaunt darted out of the generals tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with	38.50343704223633
6549/28840	He has slain his uncle he murm	126.46786499023438
6550/28840	Alas what are my servants Possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the	140.52159118652344
6551/28840	Charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but I have none   And with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by Mord	56.51447296142578
6552/28840	Whilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwells tent DArtagnan and Porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at	43.06053161621094
6553/28840	The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by DArtagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme	46.28324508666992
6554/28840	The prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own	116.85901641845703
6555/28840	It would be impossible to describe Mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen	57.928184509277344
6556/28840	Mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange	53.40855026245117
6557/28840	What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one	104.78202056884766
6558/28840	The house to which DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous	21.052331924438477
6559/28840	It was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of	55.368980407714844
6560/28840	The windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a	63.89806365966797
6561/28840	The two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the	56.85501480102539
6562/28840	Why dont we go in with them asked Porth	48.16720199584961
6563/28840	We must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied DArtagn	56.3409538269043
6564/28840	The sergeant and his men took possession of the little	70.36727905273438
6565/28840	DArtagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that	72.58602142333984
6566/28840	We have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your	94.97314453125
6567/28840	There could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received DArtagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to General Cromwells	41.72024917602539
6568/28840	The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his	177.59730529785156
6569/28840	Things look black enough replied Porthos I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mord	67.3119125366211
6570/28840	Silence cried the Gascon do not utter that	86.84004974365234
6571/28840	But argued Porthos I speak French and they are all	76.3110580444336
6572/28840	DArtagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass	45.974510192871094
6573/28840	But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying Let us go	55.18897247314453
6574/28840	They found Athos in profound despondency Aramis looked first at Porthos and then at DArtagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful	60.77205276489258
6575/28840	You want to know how we came here Tis easily	140.86158752441406
6576/28840	Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Crom	174.72840881347656
6577/28840	But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt whom I bade you distrust asked Ath	84.99781036376953
6578/28840	And whom I advised you to strangle Porthos said Aram	26.614551544189453
6579/28840	There is a certain fatality in	69.96121978759766
6580/28840	Yes you are right DArtagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us So my dear Aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to	58.45720672607422
6581/28840	Zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing	119.08114624023438
6582/28840	Yes added Athos I now ask you DArtagnan what side you are on Ah behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of	65.57328796386719
6583/28840	Do you know in what crime you are today engaged In the capture of a king his degradation and his	133.49417114257812
6584/28840	Oh oh cried Porthos do you think so   You are exaggerating Athos we are not so far gone as that replied the	32.72660827636719
6585/28840	Good heavens we are on the very eve of	66.20292663574219
6586/28840	I say why is the king taken prisoner Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a	143.4250030517578
6587/28840	Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that Cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling They will kill him you may be sure of	36.235145568847656
6588/28840	I dont maintain the contrary said DArtagn	18.75690460205078
6589/28840	A friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their	158.3302459716797
6590/28840	We have served them to the best of our poor means and God will recompense the will forgive the want of	94.18795776367188
6591/28840	You may see matters differently DArtagnan and think	59.83352279663086
6592/28840	I will not attempt to argue with you but I blame	48.751068115234375
6593/28840	Heyday cried DArtagnan what matters it to me after all if Cromwell whos an Englishman revolts against his king who is a Scotchman I am myself a	62.1313362121582
6594/28840	I have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible   Yes said Porth	26.3492374420166
6595/28840	Because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above	160.9011993408203
6596/28840	And you you DArtagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of France bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagon	88.33490753173828
6597/28840	Ah DArtagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman I say that you are very culp	22.785566329956055
6598/28840	DArtagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of Athos he encountered those of Aram	59.12101745605469
6599/28840	Porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said   Yes yes my dear count I feel that you are	32.04007339477539
6600/28840	Come he said stretching out his hand to DArtagnan come dont be sullen my dear son for I have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a	33.85149383544922
6601/28840	It would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all	58.65833282470703
6602/28840	But here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one cant	116.9327621459961
6603/28840	Who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house France his warda charming youth for we saw him in the campto fly to the aid of a rotten wormeaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old ho	98.21212005615234
6604/28840	The sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are	293.8987121582031
6605/28840	DArtagnan I am your prisonertreat me as	96.09847259521484
6606/28840	Ah pardieu said DArtagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very	32.27444076538086
6607/28840	No said Aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the Philipgh	52.494285583496094
6608/28840	And how were they treated asked DArtagn	59.8089599609375
6609/28840	Why said Aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were	91.53826141357422
6610/28840	Well I said DArtagnan I answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor	53.16620635986328
6611/28840	Sang Diou let them come on Besidesdo you see that door Athos   Yes what then   Well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the	74.59156799316406
6612/28840	I recognize you there my brave DArtagnan replied Athos but you are no longer our	30.608739852905273
6613/28840	That door is guarded DArtagnan you know	52.62473678588867
6614/28840	Very well you will force it said Porth	57.10111618041992
6615/28840	There are only a dozen men at the	74.31430053710938
6616/28840	That would be nothing for us four it is too much for us	79.87352752685547
6617/28840	No divided as we now are we must	213.84420776367188
6618/28840	See the fatal example on the Vendomois road DArtagnan you so brave and you Porthos so valiant and so strongyou were beaten today Aramis and I are beaten in our	89.2804183959961
6619/28840	Now that never happened to us when we were four	68.12745666503906
6620/28840	Let us die then as De Winter has died as for me I will fly only on condition that we all fly	98.70841979980469
6621/28840	Impossible said DArtagnan we are under Mazarins	34.229888916015625
6622/28840	I know it and I have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as	102.27629852294922
6623/28840	Besides said Aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like DArtagnan and Porth	38.719032287597656
6624/28840	Be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our	199.93460083007812
6625/28840	As for myself I shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you Athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are	75.02561950683594
6626/28840	DArtagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his	36.87990188598633
6627/28840	At last   Do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you And wherefore should they do so What interest have they in your death Moreover you are our	90.7276840209961
6628/28840	Fool cried Aramis knowest thou not then Mordaunt I have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were	212.19918823242188
6629/28840	The truth is Im very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised me said Porth	32.80990219116211
6630/28840	Eh I make no account of the harm Mordaunt can do cried DArtagn	41.287933349609375
6631/28840	Cap de Diou if he troubles me too much I will crush him the insect Do not fly	148.556396484375
6632/28840	It is useless for I swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years agoyou Athos in the Rue Ferou and you Aramis in the Rue de Vaugir	43.331398010253906
6633/28840	Stop cried Athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted you will soon know what to expect for here he	39.42442321777344
6634/28840	In fact looking at the place to which Athos pointed DArtagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gall	32.4423828125
6635/28840	Stay said DArtagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the	44.300537109375
6636/28840	When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw DArtagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their	43.81739807128906
6637/28840	Halloo he cried are the prisoners still there   Yes sir answered the sergeant uncover	69.85504913330078
6638/28840	Tis well order four men to conduct them to my	129.3195037841797
6639/28840	What is it said DArtagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his	35.943817138671875
6640/28840	What is the matter if you please   Sir replied Mordaunt I have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my	34.2019157409668
6641/28840	Wherefore sir Excuse curiosity but I wish to be enlightened on the	82.40352630615234
6642/28840	Because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and I choose to dispose of them as I	85.23133850097656
6643/28840	Allow meallow me sir said DArtagnan to observe you are in	40.44801712036133
6644/28840	The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them	91.31705474853516
6645/28840	You might have taken Lord Winterwho tis said was your uncleprisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I could have killed our prisonerswe preferred taking	72.04953002929688
6646/28840	Mordaunts very lips grew white with	5744.24853515625
6647/28840	DArtagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the	97.58797454833984
6648/28840	At the first beat Porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the	28.37306785583496
6649/28840	Sir he thus addressed DArtagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron Oliver Crom	87.81632232666016
6650/28840	These words struck DArtagnan like a thunder	34.77263641357422
6651/28840	The blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his	33.85709762573242
6652/28840	As for Porthos he looked inquiringly at DArtagn	8.799020767211914
6653/28840	This look of Porthoss made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly	80.76936340332031
6654/28840	Violence he said to himself would spoil all DArtagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he	72.56491088867188
6655/28840	Why did you not say so at once my dear sir all England is with Cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners I bend sir to your	73.69805145263672
6656/28840	Mordaunt delighted advanced Porthos looking at DArtagnan with openmouthed aston	109.00023651123047
6657/28840	Then DArtagnan trod on his foot and Porthos began to understand that this was merely	32.59469985961914
6658/28840	Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow	52.92851257324219
6659/28840	But pardon said DArtagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious General Oliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in	46.371517181396484
6660/28840	He has given you some little writing for methe least bit of paper which may show that you come in his	115.29139709472656
6661/28840	Be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that I may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my country	101.48119354248047
6662/28840	Otherwise you see although I am sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad	53.03449249267578
6663/28840	Mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at DArtagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human count	106.85823822021484
6664/28840	When I tell you a thing sir said Mordaunt you insult me by doubting	53.31483459472656
6665/28840	I cried DArtagnan I doubt what you say God keep me from it my dear Monsieur Mordaunt On the contrary I take you to be a worthy and accomplished	28.494842529296875
6666/28840	And then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued DArtagnan with his frank	32.20518493652344
6667/28840	Monsieur du Vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about	44.13885498046875
6668/28840	I do not speak for him but for	27.939353942871094
6669/28840	Well sir What more   WellIIm not	115.7235336303711

6672/28840	is the king of the Spaniards never had a penny in his	41.29136276245117
6673/28840	Go on sir I see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what I think that stops you I can obviate the	85.77486419677734
6674/28840	Ah I knew well said the Gascon that you were a man of	26.87898826599121
6675/28840	Well heres the case heres where the saddle hurts me as we French	208.47476196289062
6676/28840	I am an officer of fortune nothing else I have nothing but what my sword brings me inthat is to say more blows than bank	61.55946731567383
6677/28840	Now on taking prisoners this morning two Frenchmen who seemed to me of high birthin short two knights of the GarterI said to myself my fortune is	157.59298706054688
6678/28840	I say two because in such circumstances Monsieur du Vallon who is rich always gives me his	61.19874572753906
6679/28840	No replied DArtagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour I am a man of order sir let us do things in	39.45145034790039
6680/28840	Nevertheless replied Mordaunt I could compel you I command	131.13101196289062
6681/28840	Ah sir said DArtagnan I see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know	20.85444450378418
6682/28840	We are gentlemen we are both of us able to kill you and your eight menwe two	130.93667602539062
6683/28840	For Heavens sake dont be obstinate for when others are obstinate I am obstinate likewise and then I become ferocious and headstrong and theres my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than	75.13581085205078
6684/28840	Ask him then for the written	246.8199005126953
6685/28840	What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt   Yes the written order said Porthos who now began to comprehend what DArtagnan was aiming at we ask only for	36.725990295410156
6686/28840	However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons DArtagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the	59.428531646728516
6687/28840	He decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the	85.1210708618164
6688/28840	He therefore mounted his horse and	118.236572265625
6689/28840	Good thought DArtagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we	26.00200843811035
6690/28840	Go to the stable you will find Mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my	75.72962188720703
6691/28840	Porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his	50.295413970947266
6692/28840	I go he said only shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are   No it is not worth	49.75550842285156
6693/28840	Well do me the kindness to take my purse which I left on the mantel	51.77399444580078
6694/28840	He then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great	61.64242172241211
6695/28840	At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with	30.80274200439453
6696/28840	DArtagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos went	27.347692489624023
6697/28840	My dear Athos I have reflected on your arguments and I am	43.18509292602539
6698/28840	I am sorry to have had anything to do with this	29.069311141967773

6702/28840	Well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he	95.21809387207031

6706/28840	That will be the signal when I call outJesus Seigneur   But give us your word that you will come too DArtagnan said Ath	28.02989959716797
6707/28840	Tis settled said Aramis at the cry Jesus Seigneur we go out upset all that stands in our way run to our horses jump into our saddles spur them is that all  	78.39219665527344
6708/28840	See Aramis as I have told you DArtagnan is first amongst us all said Ath	25.30912971496582
6709/28840	Very true replied the Gascon but I always run away from	69.50885772705078
6710/28840	Dont forget the signal Jesus Seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the selfsame	43.70457458496094
6711/28840	The soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm On the rivers of	160.273681640625
6712/28840	My dear friend General Cromwell has sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch	29.308237075805664
6713/28840	Guard the prisoners well I beg of	114.05143737792969
6714/28840	The sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand French and DArtagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and	35.88588333129883
6715/28840	Then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the	71.3079833984375
6716/28840	Each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to Porthos and Mousqueton turn to the left so that Athos and Aramis may see you clearly from the	31.383211135864258
6717/28840	You didnt forget my purse   No be	87.4069595336914
6718/28840	Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their	35.257511138916016
6719/28840	Then DArtagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the	32.638343811035156
6720/28840	There caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his	80.16443634033203
6721/28840	It was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been	57.07794952392578
6722/28840	The soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran	137.08267211914062
6723/28840	Help help cried DArtagnan stopmy horse has the stag	85.98748779296875
6724/28840	In an instant the horses eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with	89.8398208618164
6725/28840	What will you let me be killed Jesus Seigneur   No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed	23.647689819335938
6726/28840	The coast owing to the Gascons stratagem was	59.500755310058594
6727/28840	The prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the	242.31710815429688
6728/28840	Stop stop cried DArtagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several	69.24417114257812
6729/28840	Stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their	394.0863952636719
6730/28840	But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest	62.787899017333984
6731/28840	In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois who were coming to find their	28.53498649597168
6732/28840	With one wave of his hand Athos made Grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind DArtagnan still directing them from behind with his	81.4871597290039
6733/28840	They passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open	107.5407943725586
6734/28840	All this time the soldiers were calling out Stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of	60.35371780395508
6735/28840	Whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen	128.13124084472656
6736/28840	It was Mordaunt with the order in his	61.420196533203125
6737/28840	The prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his	99.50261688232422
6738/28840	The sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty	109.07832336425781
6739/28840	Mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone	148.1168670654297
6740/28840	Noble Natures never lose Courage nor good Stomachs their Appet	307.0965881347656
6741/28840	The little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be	122.48664855957031
6742/28840	At last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its	44.857215881347656
6743/28840	As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council	79.39315032958984
6744/28840	The two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and Grimaud was posted as sent	61.36664962768555
6745/28840	Come first of all said Athos to DArtagnan my friend that I may shake hands with youyou our rescueryou the true hero of us	63.13893127441406
6746/28840	Athos is rightyou have my adoration said Aramis in his turn pressing his	47.53776168823242
6747/28840	The two friends recalled by DArtagnan to what was also due to Porthos pressed his hand in their	32.447776794433594
6748/28840	And now said Athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our	81.18724060058594
6749/28840	What shall we do   What are we going to do ifaith It is not very difficult to	23.292831420898438
6750/28840	We are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to	125.92562103271484
6751/28840	As for me I will give my last sou for	48.461814880371094
6752/28840	Life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a	141.58285522460938
6753/28840	What do you say to this Du Vallon   I said Porthos I am entirely of DArtagnans opinion this is a beastly country this	34.29541015625
6754/28840	You are quite decided then to leave it asked Athos of DArtagn	32.42428207397461
6755/28840	Egad I dont see what is to keep me	74.69122314453125
6756/28840	A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aram	64.94145965576172
6757/28840	Go then my friends said the former sigh	109.0958023071289
6758/28840	Let us go you mean   No my friend said Athos you must leave	33.134090423583984
6759/28840	Leave you cried DArtagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected	16.718564987182617
6760/28840	Bah said Porthos why separate since we are all together   Because you can and ought to return to France your mission is accomplished but ours is	64.03141021728516
6761/28840	Your mission is not accomplished exclaimed DArtagnan looking in astonishment at Ath	28.219985961914062
6762/28840	Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his	31.887847900390625
6763/28840	DArtagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with mad	36.94129180908203
6764/28840	You cannot be speaking seriously Athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to	74.47705078125
6765/28840	This army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcherit matters littleColonel	94.0767822265625
6766/28840	His majesty I can assure you will be tried on his arrival in London I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to	74.6110610961914
6767/28840	A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aram	62.921485900878906
6768/28840	And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued DArtagn	67.47538757324219
6769/28840	And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked Ath	56.59615707397461
6770/28840	The penalty of death I greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill	67.83308410644531
6771/28840	Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned   What did he say asked Porth	30.63962745666504
6772/28840	Princes must be knocked on the	159.8216552734375
6773/28840	And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king   On the contrary I am certain he will do	44.916019439697266
6774/28840	But then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so	81.6054458618164
6775/28840	No my friend Athos gently replied but De Winter sought us out in France and introduced us Monsieur dHerblay and myself to Madame Henri	51.96651077270508
6776/28840	Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her	139.3223114013672
6777/28840	We engaged our word our word included	1193.512939453125
6778/28840	It was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we	460.5368347167969
6779/28840	It remains now for us to keep our	99.7640609741211
6780/28840	Is that your opinion DHerblay   Yes said Aramis we have	23.532320022583008
6781/28840	Then continued Athos we have another reason it is thislisten In France at this moment everything is poor and palt	67.8169174194336
6782/28840	I have served them without enthusiasmGod knows that I estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteembut on	102.92153930664062
6783/28840	Today I am engaged in a different	69.70132446289062
6784/28840	I have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a European misfortune I attach myself to	178.63619995117188
6785/28840	If we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be	71.97549438476562
6786/28840	So you know beforehand you must perish said DArtagn	33.10896301269531
6787/28840	We fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of	96.73960876464844
6788/28840	What will you do in a foreign land an enemys country   I traveled in England when I was young I speak English like an Englishman and Aramis too knows something of the	68.62979888916016
6789/28840	In Heavens name my dear Athos do not make a useless	44.52031707763672
6790/28840	When I see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak I seem to have to do with a mad	75.73045349121094
6791/28840	Come Porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business   Nothing good replied Porth	33.85914611816406
6792/28840	Come continued DArtagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my	36.93986511230469
6793/28840	Well then believe me Athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to France with	86.48681640625
6794/28840	Friend said Athos our resolution is irrevoc	39.78335952758789
6795/28840	Only reflect my good fellow said Athos it is but dying rather	98.43025970458984
6796/28840	Pooh a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling	125.23460388183594
6797/28840	If I am astonished at anything remarked Porthos sententiously it is that it has not already	81.67423248291016
6798/28840	Oh it will happen you may be sure said DArtagn	21.057212829589844
6799/28840	So it is agreed and if Porthos makes no objection   I said Porthos I will do whatever you please and besides I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is very	24.202524185180664
6800/28840	But your future career DArtagnanyour ambition Porthos   Our future our ambition replied DArtagnan with feverish volub	35.24879455566406
6801/28840	Or he will forget us added DArtagn	60.999725341796875
6802/28840	It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for Charles	69.01984405517578
6803/28840	but none the less Anne of Austria has forgotten us for twenty	92.31829833984375
6804/28840	Well in spite of that DArtagnan said Athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her   No indeed said DArtagnan I admit even that in my darkest moments I find consolation in that	28.479764938354492
6805/28840	You see then DArtagnan though princes often are ungrateful God never	94.37862396240234
6806/28840	Athos said DArtagnan I believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to	41.839534759521484
6807/28840	So then said Athos offering his hand to DArtagn	10.86166763305664
6808/28840	I find England a charming country and I staybut on one condition	179.6156463623047
6809/28840	What is it   That I am not forced to learn	38.624351501464844
6810/28840	Well now said Athos triumphantly I swear to you my friend by the God who hears usI believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see France	65.42387390136719
6811/28840	So be it said DArtagnan but II confess I have a contrary	60.76565170288086
6812/28840	Our good DArtagnan said Aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does a	137.39175415039062
6813/28840	But in the meantime saves the country added Ath	55.24415969848633
6814/28840	Well now that everything is decided cried Porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always d	59.02434539794922
6815/28840	Oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink	154.4928436279297
6816/28840	What the devil did you come to such a country for Athos But I forgot added the Gascon smiling pardon I forgot you are no longer Athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner Porth	56.565185546875
6817/28840	My plan   Yes have you a plan   No I am hungry that is	40.758026123046875
6818/28840	Mouston appeared with a most piteous	132.1865692138672
6819/28840	What is the matter my dear	26.421764373779297
6820/28840	Are you ill   Sir I am very hungry replied M	36.74344253540039
6821/28840	Well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good	71.69557189941406
6822/28840	Could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel Faith I do not remember the name of the	61.95906448364258
6823/28840	At the hotel of said Porthos by my faithnor do I remember it	64.95901489257812
6824/28840	How is there a house in the neighborhood asked DArtagn	33.11880874633789
6825/28840	Well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that	81.19537353515625
6826/28840	What is your opinion gentlemen and does not	97.22174835205078
6827/28840	But if he should be a cavalier said Porth	16.792207717895508
6828/28840	In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowl	61.092437744140625
6829/28840	You are very happy exclaimed Athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible Gascon for you see the bright side of	66.77363586425781
6830/28840	I come from a land where there is not a cloud in the	68.78195190429688
6831/28840	It is not like this then said Porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of	64.20984649658203
6832/28840	Come come said DArtagnan more reason why we should start on our	41.7603645324707
6833/28840	Well Grimaud my friend have you seen anything asked the Gas	31.517147064208984
6834/28840	Those idiots cried Porthos they have not even pursued	84.42193603515625
6835/28840	Oh if we had been in their place   Yes they are wrong said DArtagn	21.079002380371094
6836/28840	I would willingly have said two words to Mordaunt in this little	85.76152801513672
6837/28840	It is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper	190.3483123779297
6838/28840	I think decidedly observed Aramis gentlemen that the son hasnt his mothers	189.01377868652344
6839/28840	What my good fellow replied Athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we	81.3716812133789
6840/28840	We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France if we are not poisoned or killed before	64.10128021240234
6841/28840	Ifaith yes said Athos for I am	45.97627639770508
6842/28840	Look out for the black fowls cried Aram	65.39982604980469
6843/28840	And the four friends guided by Mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as Athos had said all four once more united and of single	84.27252197265625
6844/28840	As our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded	66.0699691772461
6845/28840	Before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted	329.19708251953125
6846/28840	Egad cried DArtagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by	54.353004455566406
6847/28840	The devil said Porthos in that case they have eaten	46.34360885620117
6848/28840	Bah said DArtagnan they will have left a chicken at	27.731843948364258
6849/28840	He dismounted and knocked on the	63.47333908081055
6850/28840	He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and	70.80746459960938
6851/28840	Aha   What   Blood   At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and	33.13557434082031
6852/28840	DArtagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary	36.10759735107422
6853/28840	The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of	51.4350471496582
6854/28840	It was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do	38.68280029296875
6855/28840	Athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to	64.9056396484375
6856/28840	Well if he is dead said Athos he has not been so long for he is still	29.752796173095703
6857/28840	Ho there my friend   The wounded man heaved a	43.975433349609375
6858/28840	DArtagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his	23.107290267944336
6859/28840	The man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back	39.43007278442383
6860/28840	The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing cop	77.78826141357422
6861/28840	Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the g	114.32133483886719
6862/28840	Again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity	63.73699188232422
6863/28840	You are among friends said Athos in English so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened   The king muttered the wounded man the king is a	33.15201187133789
6864/28840	You have seen him asked Aramis in the same	32.95815658569336
6865/28840	Make your mind easy resumed Athos we are all faithful servants of his	66.82854461669922
6866/28840	Is what you tell me true asked the wounded	47.09718322753906
6867/28840	I am brother to Parry his majestys lac	48.40544128417969
6868/28840	Athos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings	41.69790267944336
6869/28840	We know him said Athos he never left the	43.335227966308594
6870/28840	Well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was	55.1270866394043
6871/28840	They brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and	94.53108215332031
6872/28840	Parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at	140.97360229492188
6873/28840	He knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the or	49.02159881591797
6874/28840	He made a sign which I understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and held themselves on	91.45506286621094
6875/28840	I went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow	46.93648147583008
6876/28840	But Parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he	51.300071716308594
6877/28840	The king was a few steps behind me when suddenly I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge	117.31029510498047
6878/28840	I wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment I felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell ins	57.17533493041992
6879/28840	When I came to myself again I was stretched in the same	69.27729797363281
6880/28840	I dragged myself as far as the	77.49844360351562
6881/28840	The king and his escort were no longer	89.15185546875
6882/28840	I spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and I fainted	171.79620361328125
6883/28840	And now how are you feeling   Very ill replied the wounded	80.54080200195312
6884/28840	Can we do anything for you asked Ath	37.94430160522461
6885/28840	Help to put me on the bed I think I shall feel better	80.81914520263672
6886/28840	Have you any one to depend on for assistance   My wife is at Durham and may return at any	96.24466705322266
6887/28840	But youis there nothing that you want   We came here with the intention of asking for something to	80.59342956542969
6888/28840	Alas they have taken everything there isnt a morsel of bread in the	130.9129638671875
6889/28840	You hear DArtagnan said Athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our	28.98069190979004
6890/28840	It is all one to me now said DArtagnan I am no longer	32.44847106933594
6891/28840	They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the	119.22529602050781
6892/28840	In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a	75.93356323242188
6893/28840	In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel	69.13121032714844
6894/28840	Now said Aramis we know how the matter	83.93272399902344
6895/28840	The king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh   Athos did not reply he	80.37046813964844
6896/28840	Yes said Porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of	42.98409652709961
6897/28840	What a confounded country this England is This is the first time I have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best	89.66366577148438
6898/28840	What do you think DArtagnan asked Ath	8.302264213562012
6899/28840	Do you agree with Aramis   Not at all said DArtagnan I am precisely of the contrary	26.661746978759766
6900/28840	What you would follow the escort exclaimed Porthos in	88.45034790039062
6901/28840	Let DArtagnan speak said Athos you know he always has wise advice to	54.0591926574707
6902/28840	Clearly said DArtagnan we must go where they will not look for	17.497228622436523
6903/28840	Now they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans therefore with the Puritans we must	97.0313949584961
6904/28840	I was about to give it when you anticipated	47.432777404785156
6905/28840	That then is your opinion asked Aram	51.365230560302734
6906/28840	They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach London with the	78.50924682617188
6907/28840	Once in London we shall be hard to findwithout considering continued Athos throwing a glance at Aramis the chances that may come to us on the	62.353248596191406
6908/28840	I however do not understand said Porth	22.85386848449707
6909/28840	But no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of DArtagnan and of Athos it must be the	25.00454330444336
6910/28840	But said Aramis shall we not be suspected by Colonel Harrison   Egad cried DArtagnan hes just the man I count	40.21405029296875
6911/28840	Colonel Harrison is one of our	68.89187622070312
6912/28840	We have met him twice at General Cromwell	42.9876708984375
6913/28840	He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin he will consider us as	55.907997131347656
6914/28840	Besides is he not a butchers son Well then Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the	94.98124694824219
6915/28840	You are the best companion that I know DArtagnan he said offering his hand to the Gascon and I am very happy in having found you again my dear	29.201383590698242
6916/28840	This was as we have seen the term which Athos applied to DArtagnan in his more expansive mood	33.01779556274414
6917/28840	He had stanched the wound and the man was	114.13331604003906
6918/28840	The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his	72.58367156982422
6919/28840	Tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me	95.1013412475586
6920/28840	However insignificant I am I am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my	65.33609008789062
6921/28840	Be easy said DArtagnan he will know all before	60.72203063964844
6922/28840	The little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league	75.93269348144531
6923/28840	My dear friends said DArtagnan give your swords to Monsieur Mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our	37.04054641723633
6924/28840	It was not long before they joined the	182.1459503173828
6925/28840	The king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale	52.59611129760742
6926/28840	DArtagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of Porthos went straight to Harrison who recognized him as having met him at Cromwells and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition	39.45694351196289
6927/28840	It turned out as DArtagnan had fore	31.922000885009766
6928/28840	The colonel neither had nor could have any	379.0910949707031
6929/28840	They halted for the king to d	70.9282455444336
6930/28840	This time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at	286.41058349609375
6931/28840	In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the	63.720794677734375
6932/28840	Will you dine with me asked Harrison of DArtagn	45.881675720214844
6933/28840	Gad I should be very happy but I have my companion Monsieur du Vallon and the two prisoners whom I cannot	28.00667953491211
6934/28840	Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from	173.3606414794922
6935/28840	The matter was arranged as DArtagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where Parry waited on him Harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his	71.09388732910156
6936/28840	The table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention Harrison sat with his back to the	169.37843322753906
6937/28840	The king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of	115.19176483154297
6938/28840	They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on	84.49547576904297
6939/28840	The officers table and that of the king were opposite to	86.15937042236328
6940/28840	Ifaith colonel said DArtagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without	88.14791870117188
6941/28840	My friend here Monsieur du Vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly	68.03739929199219
6942/28840	And I am so still said Porthos bowing to	56.68071746826172
6943/28840	And how said Harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you   In a very simple manner colonel said DArtagn	59.052467346191406
6944/28840	I was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone	44.064903259277344
6945/28840	Yes said Harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his	108.73097229003906
6946/28840	When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing theres no need to go over the ground a second	84.34487915039062
6947/28840	Ah it was this gentleman said DArtagnan bowing to the	16.946308135986328
6948/28840	I am sorry he does not speak French that I might tender him my	111.88164520263672
6949/28840	I am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good French for I resided three years in	96.6144027709961
6950/28840	Then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your	69.27558135986328
6951/28840	Nearly I thought I had quite said Gros	66.84452056884766
6952/28840	It was a very near thing but he is not	86.73444366455078
6953/28840	As he said this DArtagnan gave a glance at Parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for	27.148706436157227
6954/28840	The king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed	258.0702209472656
6955/28840	Hang it said Groslow I thought I had succeeded	112.32537078857422
6956/28840	If it were not so far from here to the house I would return and finish	57.910152435302734
6957/28840	And you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a	83.21735382080078
6958/28840	And DArtagnan threw a second glance toward Parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to him	42.73786163330078
6959/28840	Parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it	237.92677307128906
6960/28840	Ive a great desire to drink the kings health said Ath	66.51146697998047
6961/28840	Let me propose it then said DArtagn	35.299522399902344
6962/28840	Porthos looked at DArtagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions Gascon sharpness continually supplied	53.644500732421875
6963/28840	DArtagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and	54.08438491821289
6964/28840	Gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the rep	95.01073455810547
6965/28840	Heres to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as London and	106.95856475830078
6966/28840	And as DArtagnan as he spoke looked at Harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for	86.83421325683594
6967/28840	He arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on Charles while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest mis	72.4067153930664
6968/28840	The king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and	76.6932144165039
6969/28840	Come gentlemen cried Harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be	92.34374237060547
6970/28840	Where do we sleep colonel   At Thirsk replied	103.32637786865234
6971/28840	Parry said the king rising too my horse I desire to go to Thir	173.72830200195312
6972/28840	Egad said DArtagnan to Athos your king has thoroughly taken me and I am quite at his	36.335262298583984
6973/28840	If what you say is sincere replied Athos he will never reach	51.112220764160156
6974/28840	How so   Because before then we shall have carried him	72.05073547363281
6975/28840	Well this time Athos said DArtagnan upon my word you are	23.150976181030273
6976/28840	Have you some plan in your head then asked Aram	76.9351806640625
6977/28840	Ay said Porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good	55.79584503173828
6978/28840	I have none said Athos but DArtagnan will discover	23.74561882019043

6981/28840	The four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the	95.39305877685547
6982/28840	They withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an	118.25411224365234
6983/28840	The lackeys were sent to their several posts except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the	66.23143768310547
6984/28840	DArtagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loqu	38.817970275878906
6985/28840	Porthos who could never see anything that was not selfevident talked to him as	63.7535285949707
6986/28840	He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one	42.83259582519531
6987/28840	Next morning DArtagnan was the first to	28.45261001586914
6988/28840	He had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and Porthos sn	43.63596725463867
6989/28840	At eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that DArtagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Gros	34.09191131591797
6990/28840	Groslow whom DArtagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious	50.55012893676758
6991/28840	Really sir DArtagnan said to him I am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor	46.99840545654297
6992/28840	My friend Monsieur du Vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all	59.32728576660156
6993/28840	As for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for	104.82129669189453
6994/28840	The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the Stuart for whom I hope youre preparing a pretty	108.46573638916016
6995/28840	Why said Groslow that is just what we are taking him to London	37.20198440551758
6996/28840	And you never by any chance lose sight of him I presume   I should think not	52.231529235839844
6997/28840	You see he has a truly royal	460.7652893066406
6998/28840	Ay theres no fear in the daytime but at night   We redouble our	140.1627655029297
6999/28840	And what method of surveillance do you employ   Eight men remain constantly in his	130.5250701904297
7000/28840	The deuce he is well guarded	108.99461364746094
7001/28840	But besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside   Oh no Just	256.9005126953125

7004/28840	Under pretense that hes a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without	309.4287414550781
7005/28840	Really captain said DArtagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more I listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak	53.59119415283203
7006/28840	You have lived three years in Paris May I ask what you were doing there   My father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in	81.68549346923828
7007/28840	Were you pleased with Paris sir   Yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our ownnot against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an Italian the queens	100.92806243896484
7008/28840	Ah I am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorrupt	65.16327667236328
7009/28840	But said the officer I thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Crom	27.83728790283203
7010/28840	That is to say I am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to England I solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three	56.8826789855957
7011/28840	So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England you see how we snapped up the	106.65065002441406
7012/28840	Yes I know that you charged by the side of Mord	40.17367935180664
7013/28840	Ah theres another brave and excellent young	154.6704864501953
7014/28840	Do you know him asked the	51.255706787109375
7015/28840	Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from France with	34.70960998535156
7016/28840	It appears too you kept him waiting a long time at Boulog	85.78414916992188
7017/28840	What would you have I was like you and had a king in	90.6303939819336
7018/28840	Aha said Groslow what king   Our own to be sure the little oneLouis	102.42816925048828
7019/28840	And how long had you to take care of him   Three nights and by my troth I shall always remember those three nights with a certain	73.10688781738281
7020/28840	How do you mean   I mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking d	79.95660400390625
7021/28840	Ah true said the Englishman with a sigh you Frenchmen are born boon	67.2261734008789
7022/28840	And dont you play too when you are on guard   Never said the English	46.43656921386719
7023/28840	In that case you must be horribly bored and have my	79.8154296875
7024/28840	The fact is I look to my turn for keeping guard with	322.45782470703125
7025/28840	Its tiresome work to keep awake a whole	353.1866760253906
7026/28840	Yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a	59.32756805419922
7027/28840	You dont like playing then   On the contrary I	31.495325088500977
7028/28840	Lansquenet for instance   Devoted to	137.3798828125
7029/28840	I used to play almost every night in	167.6337127685547
7030/28840	And since your return to England   I have not handled a card or dice	77.31507110595703
7031/28840	I sincerely pity you said DArtagnan with an air of profound	26.752470016479492
7032/28840	Well   Tomorrow I am on	57.25868225097656
7033/28840	In Stuarts room   Yes come and pass the night with	101.2793197631836
7034/28840	Impossible   Impossible why so   I play with Monsieur du Vallon every	37.173770904541016
7035/28840	Sometimes we dont go to bed at all   Well what of that   Why he would be annoyed if I did not play with	39.737674713134766
7036/28840	Does he play well   I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled	130.51734924316406
7037/28840	But how about our prisoners   Let your servants guard	185.74005126953125
7038/28840	Yes and give them a chance of escaping said DArtagn	19.648235321044922
7039/28840	Why one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta of noble	70.07215881347656
7040/28840	We have arranged the ransom of each of them2000 on arriving in	89.40937042236328
7041/28840	We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be	107.55982208251953
7042/28840	It is true we plundered them a little when we took them and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly	61.19635009765625
7043/28840	Still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their	116.84430694580078
7044/28840	We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon	49.46487045288086
7045/28840	You see then why I must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or	164.32093811035156
7046/28840	Ah said Groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at	43.074459075927734
7047/28840	But come resumed the Englishman are these men of yours dangerous   In what respect   Are they capable of attempting violence   DArtagnan burst out laughing at the	58.547760009765625
7048/28840	Well then said Groslow bring them with	57.34568405151367
7049/28840	I have eight men on guard you	126.68635559082031
7050/28840	Four of them can guard the king and the other four your	109.10667419433594
7051/28840	Ill manage it somehow you will	139.1275177001953
7052/28840	But said DArtagnan now I think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight   Nothing at all said Gros	25.785648345947266
7053/28840	Come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your	169.46478271484375
7054/28840	Capital This evening with you tomorrow at Stuarts the next day with	146.22352600097656
7055/28840	You see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said DArtagn	69.7084732055664
7056/28840	Yes with Frenchmen and Frenchmen like	111.99341583251953
7057/28840	And Monsieur du Vallon added the	21.154102325439453
7058/28840	You will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed Mazarin between two	71.7549819946289
7059/28840	They employ him because they are afraid of	113.45418548583984
7060/28840	Ah there he is calling me	221.98915100097656
7061/28840	They exchanged bows and DArtagnan returned to his	33.91067123413086
7062/28840	What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed Porth	35.135093688964844
7063/28840	My dear fellow dont speak like that of Monsieur Gros	27.811986923217773
7064/28840	Hes one of my most intimate	91.97649383544922
7065/28840	One of your friends cried Porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers   Hush my dear Porth	25.85842514038086
7066/28840	Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and	123.56993865966797
7067/28840	Porthos opened his eyes in amazement Athos and Aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew DArtagnan and knew that he did nothing without a	28.169816970825195
7068/28840	But continued DArtagnan you shall judge of him for	29.086040496826172
7069/28840	He is coming to play with us this	75.1800308227539
7070/28840	Oho said Porthos his eyes glistening at the	30.24542999267578
7071/28840	Is he rich   Hes the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in	88.66706848144531
7072/28840	And knows lansquenet   Adores	369.3802490234375
7073/28840	Good said Porthos we shall pass an agreeable	56.039390563964844
7074/28840	The more so as it will be the prelude to a	73.93782806396484
7075/28840	How so   We invite him to play tonight he has invited us in return	87.89730072021484
7076/28840	Tonight we stop at Derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let Mousqueton buy	49.05479431152344
7077/28840	It will be well to prepare a light supper of which you Athos and Aramis are not to partakeAthos because I told him you had a fever Aramis because you are a knight of Malta and wont mix with fellows like	75.86949920654297
7078/28840	Do you understand   Thats no doubt very fine said Porthos but deuce take me if I understand at	37.995784759521484
7079/28840	Porthos my friend you know I am descended on the fathers side from the Prophets and on the mothers from the Sybils and that I only speak in parables and r	83.98837280273438
7080/28840	Let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see I can tell you nothing more at	106.59701538085938
7081/28840	Go ahead my friend said Athos I am sure that whatever you do is well	57.79773712158203
7082/28840	And you Aramis are you of that opinion   Entirely so my dear DArtagn	22.218488693237305
7083/28840	Very good said DArtagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving Porthos who must see and touch before he will	52.556636810302734
7084/28840	The fact is said Porthos with an air of finesse I am rather incred	31.620750427246094
7085/28840	DArtagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended	37.26175308227539
7086/28840	At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed	120.21656036376953
7087/28840	In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome	72.29786682128906
7088/28840	It was there a lodging was prepared for	139.38064575195312
7089/28840	At the hour agreed upon Groslow	62.95977783203125
7090/28840	DArtagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years	25.440282821655273
7091/28840	Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to Parrys brother he was not nearly so strong as	45.782596588134766
7092/28840	Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and	89.59362030029297
7093/28840	In short Groslow seemed to be pleased with his	59.66044616699219
7094/28840	Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their	77.6170883178711
7095/28840	At midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly	125.42475891113281
7096/28840	Furthermore DArtagnan went with them leaving Porthos at play with Gros	25.004411697387695
7097/28840	Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to	35.942771911621094
7098/28840	As to Groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from DArtagnan what he had lost to Porthos and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his	40.84434127807617
7099/28840	The next day was spent as	340.3943786621094
7100/28840	DArtagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his	23.23106575012207
7101/28840	To any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto Athos and Aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gay	59.90612030029297
7102/28840	Porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole	37.949405670166016
7103/28840	Arrived at Ryston DArtagnan assembled his	54.60465621948242
7104/28840	His face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole	141.21022033691406
7105/28840	The moment is at hand he	171.3988494873047
7106/28840	Yes returned DArtagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the	48.75851821899414
7107/28840	DArtagnan said Athos this is no joke I trust It would quite cut me	63.258296966552734
7108/28840	You are a very odd man Athos he replied to doubt me	123.61083984375
7109/28840	Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friends heart and a kings life I have told you and I repeat it that tonight we rescue Charles	67.65596771240234
7110/28840	You left it to me to discover the means and I have done	45.57867431640625
7111/28840	Porthos looked at DArtagnan with an expression of profound	7.735272407531738
7112/28840	Athos was pale and trembled in every	73.6404037475586
7113/28840	We are invited replied DArtagnan to pass the night with	40.26197814941406
7114/28840	But do you know where  	24.677534103393555
7115/28840	Groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him	97.63321685791016
7116/28840	Pardieu certainly all four we couldnt leave our prisoners could we   Ah ah said Aram	53.94388961791992
7117/28840	Tell us about it said Athos palpit	90.02983856201172
7118/28840	We are going then we two with our swords you with dag	223.74281311035156
7119/28840	We four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid	434.02703857421875
7120/28840	Monsieur Porthos what do you say to that   I say it is easy enough answered Porth	15.780070304870605
7121/28840	We dress the king in Groslows	259.5609130859375
7122/28840	Mousqueton Grimaud and Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first	22.236055374145508
7123/28840	We mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues	149.15518188476562
7124/28840	Athos placed his two hands on DArtagnans shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad	41.41822814941406
7125/28840	I declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in	63.32819366455078
7126/28840	Whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldnt share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in	254.83407592773438
7127/28840	I repeat it DArtagnan you are the best one among us I bless and love you my dear	42.26131820678711
7128/28840	And to think that I couldnt find that out said Porthos scratching his head it is so	50.60317611694336
7129/28840	But said Aramis if I understand rightly we are to kill them all eh   Athos shuddered and turned	24.9110107421875
7130/28840	Mordioux answered DArtagnan I believe we	36.87543869018555
7131/28840	I confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory	109.06553649902344
7132/28840	Let us see said Aramis how are we to act   I have arranged two	61.36664962768555
7133/28840	Firstly at a given signal which shall be the words At last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to	132.92047119140625
7134/28840	We on our side do the	114.83129119873047
7135/28840	We shall then be matched four against the remaining	304.0897521972656
7136/28840	If these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill	151.0382080078125
7137/28840	If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only Porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of	136.28421020507812
7138/28840	It will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper	91.81098937988281
7139/28840	But if you yourselves should be struck said Ath	90.20271301269531
7140/28840	Impossible said DArtagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and	57.34073257446289
7141/28840	Besides you will strike at the throat Porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all	107.23509979248047
7142/28840	Very good said Porthos it will be a nice little throat	71.82221221923828
7143/28840	Nonsense said DArtagnan you would do as much	38.33652114868164
7144/28840	But if you think the kings life is not worth what it must cost theres an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am	56.07895278930664
7145/28840	At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting for	58.17039108276367
7146/28840	In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch Pur	35.02131271362305
7147/28840	Good replied Athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are	106.75251007080078
7148/28840	The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was	48.332176208496094
7149/28840	It was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an	25.606225967407227
7150/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos armed with their swords and Athos and Aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was Charles Stuarts	68.29590606689453
7151/28840	The two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without	241.8404998779297
7152/28840	Ods bodikins said Groslow as the four friends entered I had almost given you	95.07772064208984
7153/28840	DArtagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear   The fact is we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I hesitated a	17.440855026245117
7154/28840	And why   DArtagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aram	11.62225341796875
7155/28840	Aha said Groslow on account of political opinions No	104.39605712890625
7156/28840	On the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their Stuart they shall see	87.09870147705078
7157/28840	Are we to pass the night in the kings room asked DArtagn	23.668533325195312
7158/28840	No but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same	90.11256408691406
7159/28840	Have you provided yourself with money I assure you I intend to play the devils game	183.84153747558594
7160/28840	DArtagnan rattled the gold in his	29.873945236206055
7161/28840	Very good said Groslow and opened the door of the	27.46219253540039
7162/28840	I will show you the way and he went in	60.55134963989258
7163/28840	DArtagnan turned to look at his	13.6149263381958
7164/28840	Porthos was perfectly indifferent Athos pale but resolute Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his	49.06787109375
7165/28840	The eight guards were at their	403.2593688964844
7166/28840	Four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had	50.716094970703125
7167/28840	Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good	97.55535888671875
7168/28840	A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less	147.440673828125
7169/28840	From time to time Parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but Charles would open his eyes and say with a smile   Go on my good Parry I am	74.23475646972656
7170/28840	Capital cried the Gascon you would make a distinguished	79.73444366455078
7171/28840	And do you think asked Groslow that Stuart will ever escape while I am on guard   No to be sure replied DArtagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon	63.661842346191406
7172/28840	It is impossible to say whether Charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of DArtagnans voice his eyelids rose in spite of	56.55714416503906
7173/28840	What are you thinking about said the king go on my good Parry unless you are	68.85400390625
7174/28840	On a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two diceboxes and	107.96308898925781
7175/28840	Gentlemen said Groslow I beg you will take your	81.04869079589844
7176/28840	I will sit facing Stuart whom I like so much to see especially where he now is and you Monsieur dArtagnan opposite to	58.934322357177734
7177/28840	Thats it said DArtagnan you Monsieur le Comte de la Fere to the right of Monsieur Gros	9.933425903320312
7178/28840	Youll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur Gros	49.914520263671875
7179/28840	By this arrangement DArtagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aram	26.988101959228516
7180/28840	At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier dHerblay Charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the	26.45857048034668
7181/28840	At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah   God said Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom I have sent unto	60.489131927490234
7182/28840	The words that Parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real	115.2585220336914
7183/28840	You asked me just now if I was in funds said DArtagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the	39.54610061645508
7184/28840	Well in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear Monsieur Groslow for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of	33.038516998291016
7185/28840	Not without my defending it said Gros	105.44046020507812
7186/28840	You know or you dont know that that is what we ask of	56.69974899291992
7187/28840	Oh yes said Groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and	93.948974609375
7188/28840	Charles had heard and understood it	137.55438232421875
7189/28840	A slight color mounted to his	159.35585021972656
7190/28840	The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered	180.45877075195312
7191/28840	Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes	52.88405990600586
7192/28840	The luck had turned and Groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible	124.8468017578125
7193/28840	Porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned DArtagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the	54.72662353515625
7194/28840	Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiring	24.3763484954834
7195/28840	They heard the guard going its	1589.4810791015625
7196/28840	How many rounds do they make a night asked DArtagnan drawing more pistoles from his	64.82039642333984
7197/28840	Five answered Groslow one every two	160.53036499023438
7198/28840	DArtagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to Porthoss nudge of the knee by a nudge	18.219331741333008
7199/28840	Those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the	89.52720642089844
7200/28840	The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the	65.74695587158203
7201/28840	Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment	318.799560546875
7202/28840	With his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pew	106.64337921142578
7203/28840	Aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poni	102.78264617919922
7204/28840	Porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his	219.92576599121094
7205/28840	DArtagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to	47.23283004760742
7206/28840	DArtagnan saw that the moment was	25.109464645385742
7207/28840	He darted a preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for	64.34519958496094
7208/28840	He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabb	28.75919532775879
7209/28840	Hang it cried DArtagnan another twenty pistoles	119.40422821044922
7210/28840	Really Captain Groslow you are too much in fortunes	83.1952133178711
7211/28840	This cant last and he drew another twenty from his	231.57125854492188
7212/28840	One more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throwonly one the	638.1104125976562
7213/28840	And he turned up two cards as usual a king for DArtagnan and an ace for	60.75093078613281
7214/28840	A king said DArtagnan its a good omen Master Groslowlook out for the	75.08248901367188
7215/28840	And in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the Gascons voice which made his partner	50.58549118041992
7216/28840	Groslow began turning the cards one after	300.37188720703125
7217/28840	If he turned up an ace first he won if a king he	227.23492431640625
7218/28840	At this word Athos and Aramis jumped	31.305871963500977
7219/28840	Daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large	62.63825988769531
7220/28840	Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen	49.999847412109375
7221/28840	Groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and	136.9250946044922
7222/28840	But Harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the kings room followed by his companion   Charles Stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to London without stopping day or	70.36929321289062
7223/28840	Prepare yourself then to start at	410.9620361328125
7224/28840	And by whom is this order given asked the	192.69496154785156
7225/28840	Mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its	363.03277587890625
7226/28840	Mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging	1023.98486328125
7227/28840	DArtagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in his huge	39.569210052490234
7228/28840	Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind	51.58122253417969
7229/28840	At this movement Mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage	105.48294830322266
7230/28840	Im afraid we are prisoners whispered DArtagnan to his	49.1320686340332
7231/28840	Colonel colonel cried Mordaunt you are	154.96400451660156
7232/28840	These four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the	79.6546401977539
7233/28840	Ah my young man said DArtagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than	76.54444122314453
7234/28840	Fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around	181.9810028076172
7235/28840	The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their musk	48.23019790649414
7236/28840	Porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the	105.08965301513672
7237/28840	Fire cried Mordaunt fire upon them   Three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and	66.39897155761719
7238/28840	The horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their sadd	68.71654510498047
7239/28840	Forward cried DArtagnan and spur for your dear lives   They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward	52.942054748535156
7240/28840	A few hundred yards beyond the town DArtagnan drew	82.9300765991211
7241/28840	Halt he cried this time we shall be	175.5988006591797
7242/28840	We must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite	69.80087280273438
7243/28840	There was a stream close by and a bridge across	336.13262939453125
7244/28840	DArtagnan led his horse under the arch of the	38.59229278564453
7245/28840	Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horse	47.09419250488281
7246/28840	A few minutes more and the troop passed over their	79.68168640136719
7247/28840	As soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance DArtagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward	37.28269958496094
7248/28840	This time said DArtagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot I think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach	45.07745361328125
7249/28840	What do you say Athos to that proposition Isnt it reasonable   Yes dear friend Athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonableit was noble and	65.79032897949219
7250/28840	You said Let us die here I recall to you that	84.03604888916016
7251/28840	Oh said Porthos death is nothing it isnt death that can disquiet us since we dont know what it	56.074832916259766
7252/28840	What troubles me is the idea of	132.03318786621094
7253/28840	As things are turning out I foresee that we must give battle to London to the provinces to all England and certainly in the end we cant fail to be	121.73175048828125
7254/28840	We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said Ath	108.40357971191406
7255/28840	Whatever happens let us not leave England before the	165.4838104248047
7256/28840	Dont you agree with me Aramis   Entirely my dear	21.6959285736084
7257/28840	Then too I confess I should not be sorry to come across Mordaunt	83.1732406616211
7258/28840	It appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at	50.478206634521484
7259/28840	Ah thats another thing said DArtagnan and I should not mind waiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in	70.85394287109375
7260/28840	Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for I imagine just now that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with	61.85226058959961
7261/28840	Athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin   I think I know what you want replied Ath	64.90860748291016
7262/28840	De Winter took us to the house of a Spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an Englishman by the guineas of his new compat	63.50615310668945
7263/28840	What do you say to it Aramis   Why the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part I agree to	37.74994659423828
7264/28840	You forget Aramis one precaution of considerable	269.504150390625
7265/28840	What is that   The precaution of changing our	82.92244720458984
7266/28840	I dont see why we are very comfortable in those we	110.15637969970703
7267/28840	Our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the Frenchman at first	174.6905059814453
7268/28840	Now I dont set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for change of scene to the	198.36830139160156
7269/28840	Ive remarked that your Puritans revel in that	172.43702697753906
7270/28840	But can you find your man said Aramis to Ath	48.24612045288086
7271/28840	He lives at the Bedford Tavern Greenhall	22.318342208862305
7272/28840	Besides I can find my way about the city with my eyes	153.37890625
7273/28840	I wish we were already there said DArtagnan and my advice is that we reach London before daybreak even if we kill our	40.01731491088867
7274/28840	Come on then said Athos for unless I am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to	50.57279586791992
7275/28840	The friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the	39.37993621826172
7276/28840	They were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but Athos replied in excellent English that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce to his colleague Monsieur Bridge the approach of the	66.52437591552734
7277/28840	That reply led to several questions about the kings capture and Athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished	191.0985107421875
7278/28840	The way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of Puritan	95.74760437011719
7279/28840	He went direct to the Bedford Tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising	72.32303619384766
7280/28840	Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the	130.79104614257812
7281/28840	The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously	349.1614990234375
7282/28840	The landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his	169.0441436767578
7283/28840	Athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable	95.5225601196289
7284/28840	Aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a military	86.78399658203125
7285/28840	Porthos was seduced by a winecolored doublet and seagreen bree	45.056636810302734
7286/28840	DArtagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar	73.29911041259766
7287/28840	Now said DArtagnan for the actual	29.884973526000977
7288/28840	We must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult	132.48251342773438
7289/28840	As we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the Pur	68.03866577148438
7290/28840	This as you know is the important point of distinction between the Covenanter and the Caval	111.20213317871094
7291/28840	After some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role of bar	109.46672058105469
7292/28840	And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent said Aram	42.38292694091797
7293/28840	My head feels actually cold said Porth	207.07908630371094
7294/28840	As for me I feel anxious to preach a sermon said DArtagn	27.441024780273438
7295/28840	Now said Athos that we cannot even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the kings	62.73067855834961
7296/28840	They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings	175.86561584472656
7297/28840	A carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic Porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage	58.3932991027832
7298/28840	DArtagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the	39.558387756347656
7299/28840	The next day Athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the Act of Parliament which summoned the exking Charles	85.92608642578125
7300/28840	Parliament can never have passed such an act as	154.84523010253906
7301/28840	At this moment the landlord came	100.73117065429688
7302/28840	Did parliament pass this act Athos asked of him in	368.16888427734375
7303/28840	As to Porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast	77.34066009521484
7304/28840	You were asking then said the host in	138.94302368164062
7305/28840	Oh the devil said Porthos I am sorry for that it would have been one language	31.66254425048828
7306/28840	When I speak of the pure parliament resumed the host I mean the one which Colonel Bridge has we	157.0004425048828
7307/28840	Ah really said DArtagnan these people are very	40.920867919921875
7308/28840	When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadj	54.03413009643555
7309/28840	One of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there wont be any parliament at	44.968624114990234
7310/28840	Now of two hundred and fiftyone members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninetyone who were in the way and might have upset his political	101.64256286621094
7311/28840	He took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the	62.367496490478516
7312/28840	Very   And all these one hundred and ninetyone were Royalists asked Ath	91.99816131591797
7313/28840	Without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the	42.12773132324219
7314/28840	To be sure said Porthos with majestic common sense they were in the	82.63796997070312
7315/28840	And you think said Aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal   He will be forced to do so smiled the Spani	53.049983978271484
7316/28840	But said Aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or	109.12217712402344
7317/28840	DArtagnan whistled a little air of incredul	19.77739715576172
7318/28840	We shall see said Athos for we shall go to the sittings I	63.486080169677734
7319/28840	You will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin	114.9577407836914
7320/28840	So then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken   Of course said DArtagnan they began the day he was	47.23731994628906
7321/28840	And you know said Aramis that it was our friend Mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overt	58.52082443237305
7322/28840	And you know added DArtagnan that whenever I catch him I will kill him this Mord	41.55815124511719
7323/28840	Touching unanimity cried DArtagnan which well becomes good citizens like	232.83428955078125
7324/28840	Let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little	92.5904769897461
7325/28840	Yes said Porthos twill be at least a little change from	41.97774124145508
7326/28840	was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge	188.58201599121094
7327/28840	All London was crowding to the doors of the	94.09607696533203
7328/28840	The throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their	186.0562286376953
7329/28840	The judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his	101.34791564941406
7330/28840	Charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over	81.7948226928711
7331/28840	Then when the officer was gone he sat down in the armchair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his	41.43856430053711
7332/28840	Parry who accompanied him stood behind	563.3646850585938
7333/28840	DArtagnan was looking at Athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his	47.35770034790039
7334/28840	This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos frightened	126.82657623291016
7335/28840	I hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this	72.04080200195312
7336/28840	Set your mind at rest replied Ath	85.51165771484375
7337/28840	Aha continued DArtagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being	55.84466552734375
7338/28840	They had only halberds before now they have musk	114.73151397705078
7339/28840	The halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for	54.085052490234375
7340/28840	Thirty forty fifty sixtyfive men said Porthos counting the	103.06301879882812
7341/28840	Ah said Aramis but you forget the	49.2547607421875
7342/28840	He recognized Mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the	78.5133285522461
7343/28840	Do you think they have recognized us said DArtagn	26.890384674072266
7344/28840	In that case I should beat a	69.29454040527344
7345/28840	I dont care to be shot in a	64.74418640136719
7346/28840	No said Aramis he has not seen	25.951824188232422
7347/28840	He sees no one but the	55.413509368896484
7348/28840	Mon Dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog Does he hate his majesty as much as he does us   Pardi answered Athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and	66.97126770019531
7349/28840	True said Aramis but silence the president is speaking to the	50.39139938354492
7350/28840	Stuart Bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to	166.96607971191406
7351/28840	The king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for	53.95443344116211
7352/28840	Bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of	88.93492889404297
7353/28840	Out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained	110.86280822753906
7354/28840	When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the	70.33238983154297
7355/28840	Fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be	105.27948760986328
7356/28840	A loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of	129.28750610351562
7357/28840	It is a womans voice cried Aramis faith I would give a good deal if she is young and	55.13938903808594
7358/28840	And he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of	80.86123657226562
7359/28840	By my soul said Aramis she is	57.10035705566406
7360/28840	Look DArtagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of Bradshaws gaze she has not turned	47.39268112182617
7361/28840	It is Lady Fairfax herself said DArtagn	65.22454833984375
7362/28840	Dont you remember Porthos we saw her at General Cromwells   The roll call	39.81635665893555
7363/28840	These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the Comte de la F	39.594791412353516
7364/28840	Is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him Ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look with	41.546451568603516
7365/28840	The king is really very handsome said Porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is	81.01719665527344
7366/28840	The feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pist	41.48108673095703
7367/28840	The roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of	331.34295654296875
7368/28840	A second time he was disappointed in his	115.25225830078125
7369/28840	Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in	416.4498291015625
7370/28840	I told you so Athos said DArtagnan shrugging his	10.15740966796875
7371/28840	Now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and	103.11601257324219
7372/28840	Never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly	459.60736083984375
7373/28840	Charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty	127.0613784790039
7374/28840	The fact is said DArtagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves	93.93643188476562
7375/28840	But it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard	47.04106140136719
7376/28840	In any case Aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is The king can do no	128.9430389404297
7377/28840	Meantime DArtagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the	44.63735580444336
7378/28840	I must speak to him about	33.04755783081055
7379/28840	At this moment the accuser concluded with these words The present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the English	129.28689575195312
7380/28840	At these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind DArtagn	59.25776290893555
7381/28840	Ninetenths of the English people are horrified at what you	63.81727600097656
7382/28840	This voice was that of Athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public	48.15837478637695
7383/28840	King judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were	119.16107177734375
7384/28840	Mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing pale and	234.35882568359375
7385/28840	He had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his	189.7443084716797
7386/28840	A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were Fire on that bench he	94.27800750732422
7387/28840	Charles also had recognized the four French	100.51636505126953
7388/28840	He put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful	63.39578628540039
7389/28840	Mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing	145.0075225830078
7390/28840	More than half an hour passed before any one could make himself	96.4778060913086
7391/28840	The judges were looking for a new outbreak from the	63.916072845458984
7392/28840	The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and	161.39759826660156
7393/28840	What have you to say in your defense asked Bradshaw of the	45.89093017578125
7394/28840	Then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner Charles	125.63311767578125
7395/28840	Before questioning me he said reply to my	165.66310119628906
7396/28840	I was free at Newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both	284.6246337890625
7397/28840	Instead of performing your part of this contract as I performed mine you bought me from the Scotch cheaply I know and that does honor to the economic talent of your	144.17816162109375
7398/28840	But because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king	65.30316162109375
7399/28840	To answer you would be to forget	76.62599182128906
7400/28840	I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question	47.345306396484375
7401/28840	To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and I only acknowledge you as my execution	82.6390380859375
7402/28840	And in the middle of a deathlike silence Charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm	64.29170989990234
7403/28840	Why are not my Frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when	80.15357971191406
7404/28840	Well said the president seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent so be	147.84568786621094
7405/28840	We will judge you in spite of your	67.77253723144531
7406/28840	You are accused of treason of abuse of power and	228.56027221679688
7407/28840	Go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in	172.2214813232422
7408/28840	Charles rose and turned toward Parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with	83.79444122314453
7409/28840	Well my dear Parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner   Oh my king said Parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the	33.379940032958984
7410/28840	And why Parry   Do not look I implore you my	59.25422668457031
7411/28840	But what is the matter Speak said Charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded	89.14033508300781
7412/28840	It isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the	106.01478576660156
7413/28840	Fools said Charles do they take me for a coward like themselves You have done well to warn	129.62213134765625
7414/28840	When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the	137.41226196289062
7415/28840	And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed	55.27277374267578
7416/28840	When he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening	75.6208267211914
7417/28840	How many people thought he and not one true	409.6095886230469
7418/28840	And as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said   Respect to fallen	159.11508178710938
7419/28840	The king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and	90.84257507324219
7420/28840	It was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final	101.26251220703125
7421/28840	But the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of swordhilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Gros	75.92107391357422
7422/28840	Alas said Charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling	96.01817321777344
7423/28840	He continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of Naz	81.81736755371094
7424/28840	Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose	285.9561462402344
7425/28840	The crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Ath	57.112606048583984
7426/28840	Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile Poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own	61.104530334472656
7427/28840	Athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr	128.43115234375
7428/28840	When the soldier saluted Charles Athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the French gentleman had slipped into his	141.7111358642578
7429/28840	But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his	114.1277084350586
7430/28840	But DArtagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried Wait   Athos	25.539640426635742
7431/28840	DArtagnan leaning on Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several	33.39928436279297
7432/28840	The man took his way toward the	79.44359588623047
7433/28840	The man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his	87.20696258544922
7434/28840	Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the Frenchmen passed some jests from one to	89.97773742675781
7435/28840	I dont know English Athos said DArtagnan but you know it and will interpret for	22.352636337280273
7436/28840	You have befouled the face of your	401.19525146484375
7437/28840	Athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of	130.474853515625
7438/28840	Aramis at this movement drew his	92.26254272460938
7439/28840	And seizing the butcher by the throat   Porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single	61.859989166259766
7440/28840	Porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed	96.67034912109375
7441/28840	The man fell like an ox beneath the pole	137.25352478027344
7442/28840	His companions horrorstruck could neither move nor cry	293.8740234375
7443/28840	Tell them this Athos resumed DArtagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the	148.20396423339844
7444/28840	The fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming	189.3949432373047
7445/28840	Justice is done said Porthos wiping his	38.28209686279297
7446/28840	And now said DArtagnan to Athos entertain no further doubts about me I undertake all that concerns the	66.2825927734375
7447/28840	The parliament condemned Charles to death as might have been fore	180.0314178466797
7448/28840	Political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the	164.6171417236328
7449/28840	Such is the atrocious logic of	112.44391632080078
7450/28840	Although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with	149.0574188232422
7451/28840	DArtagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody	68.55198669433594
7452/28840	But by what means As yet he could form no definite plan all must depend on	326.0739440917969
7453/28840	Meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following daythe day appointed by the	67.04808044433594
7454/28840	The only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the London execution	96.01950073242188
7455/28840	The headsman out of the way the sentence could not be	84.75574493408203
7456/28840	True they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the	69.68762969970703
7457/28840	DArtagnan took upon himself that more than difficult	78.66780090332031
7458/28840	Another thing not less essential was to warn Charles Stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their	77.06681060791016
7459/28840	Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit	84.66708374023438
7460/28840	Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cromwells	138.93751525878906
7461/28840	Aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishops place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at White	97.62679290771484
7462/28840	Finally Athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving Englandin case either of failure or of	225.81365966796875
7463/28840	The night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven oclock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous	117.59855651855469
7464/28840	The palace of Whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of Cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents	151.91709899902344
7465/28840	Alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of y	158.62010192871094

7467/28840	Charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he was waiting first for Juxon then for martyr	57.402339935302734
7468/28840	At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in	100.73847961425781
7469/28840	In fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a	61.25959014892578
7470/28840	He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the	33.634857177734375
7471/28840	He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was	86.38900756835938
7472/28840	Charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and	70.25453186035156
7473/28840	But I shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune I have ruined by my	99.28379821777344
7474/28840	He will speak to me of God and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public	100.38391876220703
7475/28840	And he raised the medallion to his	69.95491027832031
7476/28840	A neighboring church clock slowly struck the	2703.454345703125
7477/28840	The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty	323.2457580566406
7478/28840	These were the ancestors of Charles standing back dimly in their tarnished	157.25286865234375
7479/28840	An awful sadness enveloped the heart of	194.4932861328125
7480/28840	That king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered	70.80256652832031
7481/28840	Suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious	59.29829406738281
7482/28840	The guards retired the room resumed its	842.5110473632812
7483/28840	Juxon cried Charles Juxon thank you my last friend you come at a fitting	136.43922424316406

7486/28840	If its Parry said the bishop I have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who I am and for what I am	61.50642395019531
7487/28840	At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out when Aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of	46.97419738769531
7488/28840	Yes sire interrupted Aramis raising his voice Bishop Juxon the faithful knight of Christ obedient to your majestys	44.206085205078125
7489/28840	Charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a	71.52388763427734
7490/28840	You he said you how did you penetrate hither If they recognize you you are	126.56964111328125

7494/28840	Do you know that I die tomorrow at ten oclock   Something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution	58.05876922607422
7495/28840	The king looked at Aramis with aston	32.35434341430664
7496/28840	At this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the	52.33107376098633
7497/28840	I hear said Aramis but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of	81.90511322021484
7498/28840	I know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily	71.87743377685547

7502/28840	I am condemned leave me to my	77.21393585205078
7503/28840	My king said Aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they cannot make an execution	73.4510726928711
7504/28840	What do you mean asked the	17.44171905517578
7505/28840	I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or	48.03266143798828
7506/28840	The scaffold will be ready by tomorrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after	46.980712890625
7507/28840	How can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of	46.36800003051758
7508/28840	Oh sir cried Parry may you and yours be blessed   How can it be repeated the	80.7337875366211

7510/28840	I know nothing about it continued Aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when I left him Tell the king that tomorrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him	59.715179443359375
7511/28840	He has said it and will do	84.18363952636719

7517/28840	Oh chevalier cried the king what can I say to you There is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my	62.68406677246094
7518/28840	If you succeed I do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as I am royalty I assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his	72.66629791259766

7520/28840	Aramis stooped to kiss the kings hand but Charles clasped his and pressed it to his	64.3240966796875
7521/28840	At this moment a man entered without even knocking at the	55.771480560302734
7522/28840	Aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held	65.63009643554688
7523/28840	The man was one of those Puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around Crom	91.74071502685547
7524/28840	What do you want sir said the	18.96519660949707
7525/28840	I desire to know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end said the	45.623695373535156
7526/28840	And what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same	49.624874114990234

7530/28840	After my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man I shall hear you with pleasure	63.52653884887695
7531/28840	The man retired but not before examining the supposed Juxon with an attention which did not escape the	106.02777862548828
7532/28840	Chevalier said the king when the door was closed I believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil	47.20990753173828
7533/28840	Take care that no misfortune befalls you when you	154.3609619140625
7534/28840	I thank your majesty said Aramis but under these robes I have a coat of mail a pistol and a	76.576904296875
7535/28840	Go then sir and God keep you   The king accompanied him to the door where Aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the anterooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops	39.582401275634766
7536/28840	Everything has succeeded as I expected spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless	129.1278076171875
7537/28840	May God protect you my son for your example has given me at the same time hope and	78.88220977783203
7538/28840	Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to	38.48491668701172
7539/28840	He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large	25.992977142333984
7540/28840	He placed his hand on his dagger and	47.667076110839844

7542/28840	Have you seen the king   Yes and all goes	53.9610481262207
7543/28840	We are to meet our friends at the hotel at	100.9852066040039
7544/28840	It was then striking halfpast ten by	130.8817596435547
7545/28840	Arrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos	98.21315002441406
7546/28840	Alls well he cried as he entered I have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any	123.76458740234375
7547/28840	It is waiting for us at Greenwich opposite the Isle of Dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive	61.960426330566406

7552/28840	The sum was collected in a	311.049072265625
7553/28840	DArtagnan ran out and returned directly	55.354488372802734
7554/28840	Ough and not without a deal of trouble	262.60626220703125
7555/28840	Has the executioner left London asked Ath	216.0729522705078
7556/28840	Ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by	137.43072509765625

7560/28840	Bravo said Aramis how did you manage it   Like everything else with money but it cost me	76.7967758178711
7561/28840	And where did you get so much money said Ath	54.42814636230469
7562/28840	Had you then that sum   The queens famous diamond answered DArtagnan with a	47.172733306884766
7563/28840	You bought it back then from Monsieur des Essarts asked Porth	31.011049270629883
7564/28840	Yes but it was fated that I should not keep	35.26557540893555
7565/28840	So then we are all right as regards the executioner said Athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call	73.34554290771484
7566/28840	And this one had his said DArtagnan but as good luck would have it just as I thought I should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken	82.37071990966797
7567/28840	In the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the kings window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke	59.06052017211914
7568/28840	Ah cried Aramis that accounts for the cry I	142.52297973632812

7572/28840	The letter from the executioners assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he	183.1868133544922
7573/28840	Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his	588.411865234375
7574/28840	It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saw	119.72293090820312
7575/28840	Lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his	82.9699935913086
7576/28840	He could not endure it and sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their	69.96338653564453
7577/28840	The sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed Parry to	92.54876708984375
7578/28840	Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black ser	111.98503112792969
7579/28840	Raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower	82.03175354003906
7580/28840	Parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron	106.25801086425781
7581/28840	My friends said Parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly The king wishes to get a	162.26016235351562
7582/28840	One of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of	92.6153335571289
7583/28840	The face of the first was lost to Parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amaz	46.20443344116211
7584/28840	Very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent	218.08998107910156
7585/28840	Tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow	227.02362060546875
7586/28840	These blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of	160.1002197265625
7587/28840	But Parry withdrew thinking he was	220.4187774658203
7588/28840	At the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was	44.883766174316406

7592/28840	The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in	52.60987091064453
7593/28840	It was Athos he had recognized and Porthos who was boring a hole through the	38.73270797729492
7594/28840	This hole communicated with a kind of loftthe space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below	67.74861907958984
7595/28840	Their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the kings room so as to form a kind of trap	55.77225112915039
7596/28840	Day gilded the tops of the	87.69296264648438
7597/28840	The aperture was finished and Athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the kings	82.2341079711914
7598/28840	He had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to	66.73365020751953
7599/28840	DArtagnan returned to change his workmans clothes for his chestnutcolored suit and Porthos to put on his red double	46.56587600708008
7600/28840	As for Aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the kings	38.168113708496094
7601/28840	All three agreed to meet at noon in Whitehall Place to see how things went	259.69091796875
7602/28840	Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the	39.31678771972656
7603/28840	Adieu then and be of good courage said Ath	132.43067932128906
7604/28840	Report to the king the condition of	86.60409545898438
7605/28840	Say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then I can continue my work in	103.65904235839844

7614/28840	The trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has	90.49583435058594
7615/28840	In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be	43.77436828613281

7617/28840	Your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other	56.193626403808594
7618/28840	Athos put his arm around Aramiss neck and embraced	132.66761779785156
7619/28840	Now if I die say to DArtagnan that I love him as a son and embrace him for	37.08790969848633
7620/28840	Embrace also our good and brave Porth	268.7845458984375
7621/28840	I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the	38.86897277832031
7622/28840	Aramis parted from Athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of Crom	37.0578498840332
7623/28840	He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold	88.14749908447266
7624/28840	Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians DArtagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious	47.292415618896484
7625/28840	Aramis related what had been agreed	90.92565155029297
7626/28840	DArtagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his	21.285261154174805
7627/28840	Bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the	87.87446594238281
7628/28840	What with DArtagnan Grimaud and Mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of	53.06742858886719
7629/28840	I say nothing about Blaisois for he is only fit to hold the	45.89788818359375
7630/28840	Two minutes a man makes four	656.19140625

7632/28840	Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his	53.3123664855957
7633/28840	Now said he Im off to the	186.6289825439453
7634/28840	Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar	183.37576293945312
7635/28840	I pass my life upon my	135.36383056640625
7636/28840	Aramis again presented himself at the	69.92229461669922
7637/28840	Juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to	78.2226333618164
7638/28840	Dressed as Aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacons dress got in by his	83.16963195800781
7639/28840	The carriage stopped at the door of the	25.734397888183594
7640/28840	It was about nine oclock in the	16.25312042236328
7641/28840	The anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by	204.18841552734375
7642/28840	The king was already sanguine but when he perceived Aramis his hope turned to	124.125
7643/28840	He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aram	39.10570526123047
7644/28840	The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous	91.84518432617188
7645/28840	The king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same	274.3091735839844
7646/28840	Juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the	137.37203979492188
7647/28840	As soon as the door was closed   Sire said Aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the London executioner has	38.76412582397461
7648/28840	His assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we heard was hisand there is no executioner nearer at hand than	283.845703125
7649/28840	But the Comte de la Fere asked the	8.66877555847168
7650/28840	Two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the	180.15345764160156
7651/28840	The king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the	138.53404235839844
7652/28840	So said Charles he who knocks down there   Is the Comte de la Fere sire said Aram	18.82615089416504
7653/28840	He is preparing a way for your majesty to	68.19821166992188
7654/28840	Parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be	394.08544921875
7655/28840	Sire replied Juxon you shall be ob	86.19906616210938
7656/28840	Meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the	141.94410705566406
7657/28840	Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and	98.20630645751953
7658/28840	It was that of a number of men steadily	92.1640396118164
7659/28840	All eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemn	32.48685073852539
7660/28840	A parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their	247.93521118164062
7661/28840	What is this said Aramis to Jux	29.666379928588867
7662/28840	Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about	72.71073150634766
7663/28840	Then it is for today asked the	103.71205139160156
7664/28840	Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning   Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London executioner   The London executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services	61.673439025878906
7665/28840	The execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal	130.40774536132812
7666/28840	A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles evinced as he learned these tid	73.25802612304688
7667/28840	His heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the	129.97305297851562
7668/28840	Charles perceived it and took his	54.206546783447266
7669/28840	There is but little reason why I should delay	91.46412658691406
7670/28840	Firstly I wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last	79.4640884399414
7671/28840	Will this be permitted me   Certainly replied the officer and left the	68.46170043945312
7672/28840	Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned	107.5291519165039
7673/28840	Oh my lord bishop he cried seizing Juxons hands where is Providence where is Providence   My son replied the bishop with firmness you see Him not because the passions of the world conceal	97.77195739746094
7674/28840	My son said the king to Aramis do not take it so to	81.9155044555664
7675/28840	God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their	103.81095886230469
7676/28840	Ascribe to men then what is happening and not to	345.30218505859375
7677/28840	It is men who drive me to death it is men who make you	118.05156707763672
7678/28840	Yes sire said Aramis yes you are	17.82921028137207
7679/28840	It is men whom I should hold responsible and I will hold them	127.73958587646484
7680/28840	Be seated Juxon said the king falling upon his	83.95205688476562
7681/28840	I have now to confess to	41.4169807434082
7682/28840	Remain sir he added to Aramis who had moved to leave the	94.939453125
7683/28840	I have nothing to say that cannot be said before	48.25455856323242
7684/28840	Juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his	144.63931274414062
7685/28840	Remember     The mob had already assembled when the confession	49.50627136230469
7686/28840	The kings children next arrivedthe Princess Charlotte a beautiful fairhaired child with tears in her eyes and the Duke of Gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing	161.68992614746094
7687/28840	He had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the	160.08189392089844
7688/28840	Charless heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of	51.532814025878906
7689/28840	He turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and	96.89047241210938
7690/28840	Then he took the boy upon his	171.75877380371094
7691/28840	My son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came	55.68456268310547
7692/28840	These men are going to behead your	112.0809326171875
7693/28840	Perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York your elder	77.3148193359375
7694/28840	But you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are	59.30406188964844
7695/28840	Swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the	108.69728088378906
7696/28840	For one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as I	84.27613067626953
7697/28840	The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said I swear to your	47.05034637451172
7698/28840	Henry said Charles call me your	454.619873046875
7699/28840	Father replied the child I swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me	62.02989196777344
7700/28840	Now kiss me and you too	256.7795104980469
7701/28840	Oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers	276.60198974609375
7702/28840	Take them away Juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to	147.0913848876953
7703/28840	Juxon led them away and this time the doors were left	128.83352661132812
7704/28840	Meanwhile Athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his	101.10103607177734
7705/28840	Two long hours he waited in terrible	428.33660888671875
7706/28840	A deathlike silence reigned in the room	95.55239868164062
7707/28840	At last he determined to discover the cause of this still	77.93215942382812
7708/28840	He crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaff	63.21870422363281
7709/28840	Peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the	41.91698455810547
7710/28840	What is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed cloth he was holding	118.93212890625
7711/28840	The people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators I see DArtagn	49.97003173828125
7712/28840	What is he waiting for What is he looking at Good God have they allowed the headsman to escape   Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the	106.83072662353516
7713/28840	The sound of heavy steps was heard above his	213.09828186035156
7714/28840	The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then	67.62281036376953
7715/28840	At the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words   Colonel I want to speak to the	50.332542419433594
7716/28840	It was the king speaking on the scaff	114.21907043457031
7717/28840	In fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread Charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for	100.64470672607422
7718/28840	Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the execution	83.64840698242188
7719/28840	He approached the block and laid his axe upon	151.59805297851562
7720/28840	Behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was Charles Stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaff	87.21469116210938
7721/28840	The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged	140.12974548339844
7722/28840	Every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following	110.84351348876953
7723/28840	But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his	57.955787658691406
7724/28840	The kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of Athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the	108.49112701416016
7725/28840	Do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his	150.38473510742188
7726/28840	At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the	101.55816650390625
7727/28840	Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Jux	44.01252746582031
7728/28840	Then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of Henrietta	64.89366149902344
7729/28840	Sir said he to the priest I shall keep this cross in my hand till the last	59.88115692138672
7730/28840	Take it from me when I am	111.4688491821289
7731/28840	Yes sire said a voice which Athos recognized as that of Aram	30.177961349487305
7732/28840	He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the	30.758893966674805
7733/28840	One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his	56.49660873413086
7734/28840	Then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to	72.07389068603516
7735/28840	All the preparations were made with a frightful calm	116.21148681640625
7736/28840	One would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his	65.82547760009766
7737/28840	Will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied	105.3926010131836
7738/28840	Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown heads	53.533485412597656
7739/28840	His calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his	218.3782196044922
7740/28840	But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aram	40.4343376159668
7741/28840	The king seeing that he did not reply repeated his	116.82498168945312
7742/28840	It will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the	52.611289978027344
7743/28840	The king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said   This block is very low is there no other to be had   It is the usual block answered the man in the	53.495182037353516
7744/28840	Do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the	56.635276794433594
7745/28840	There was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shudd	109.21759796142578
7746/28840	I do not wish to be taken by surprise added the	33.59442138671875
7747/28840	I shall kneel down to pray do not strike	150.72178649902344
7748/28840	When shall I strike   When I shall lay my head on the block and say Remember then strike	167.5457305908203
7749/28840	Gentlemen said the king to those around him I leave you to brave the tempest I go before you to a kingdom which knows no	136.15066528320312
7750/28840	He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his	28.4893798828125
7751/28840	Now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer I beseech	80.69803619384766
7752/28840	You also stand aside he said to the masked	157.81361389160156
7753/28840	It is only for a moment and I know that I belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till I give the	35.37045669555664
7754/28840	Then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in French Comte de la Fere are you there   Yes your majesty he answered	32.02736282348633
7755/28840	Faithful friend noble heart said the king I should not have been	128.19790649414062
7756/28840	I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God last of all I speak to	79.3777084350586
7757/28840	To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have lost the throne and my children their	172.980712890625
7758/28840	A million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of Newcastle	261.4456787109375
7759/28840	You only know that this money	92.30157470703125
7760/28840	Make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons	73.26193237304688
7761/28840	Farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped Athos chilled with	182.78440856933594
7762/28840	A moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed Remember   He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his	61.39372634887695
7763/28840	He reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson catar	98.04740905761719
7764/28840	Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or	85.9488296508789
7765/28840	At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred	61.762168884277344
7766/28840	Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the	43.37931823730469
7767/28840	Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarchs blood fell down ins	54.728214263916016
7768/28840	The snow was falling thick and	789.4373168945312
7769/28840	Aramis was the next to come in and to discover Athos almost ins	74.0981674194336
7770/28840	But at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had	28.13685417175293
7771/28840	Well said Aramis beaten by fate   Beaten said Ath	63.51591110229492
7772/28840	Noble and unhappy king   Are you wounded cried Aram	89.04186248779297
7773/28840	Where were you then   Where you left meunder the scaff	62.93942642211914
7774/28840	Did you see it all   No but I heard	27.811874389648438
7775/28840	God preserve me from another such hour as I have just	140.6755828857422
7776/28840	Then you know that I did not leave him   I heard your voice up to the last	40.744415283203125
7777/28840	Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the	70.28857421875
7778/28840	Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied Athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the kings	46.223175048828125
7779/28840	And what he continued has been done with the poor body   By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to	80.94822692871094
7780/28840	The doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted	85.44652557373047
7781/28840	Mockery muttered Athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered   Well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which Porthos had just	86.47633361816406
7782/28840	We are all mortal my poor	188.03427124023438
7783/28840	Yes there were some people on the way who delayed	146.4335479736328
7784/28840	I took one of them by the throat and threequarters throttled	35.80338668823242
7785/28840	Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so I took advantage of his silence to walk	106.3185806274414
7786/28840	Have you seen DArtagnan   We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him	49.534263610839844
7787/28840	Oh said Athos satirically I saw	37.258121490478516
7788/28840	He was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the	119.55657196044922
7789/28840	They were anxious about you here I simply told them where you	400.71246337890625
7790/28840	You didnt know King Charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love	65.12355041503906
7791/28840	So saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his	57.1246452331543
7792/28840	Ugh I am tired cried DArtagnan sitting	65.46285247802734
7793/28840	Drink a glass of port said Aramis it will refresh	174.390869140625
7794/28840	Yes let us drink said Athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with DArtagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful	32.71737289428711
7795/28840	The felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave tonight we have nothing more to do	38.673179626464844
7796/28840	You are in a hurry sir count said DArtagn	15.084426879882812
7797/28840	Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his	265.002197265625
7798/28840	Ah you remain in London said Porth	27.636756896972656
7799/28840	And you   Hang it said Porthos a little perplexed between the two I suppose as I came with you I must go away with	40.1182975769043
7800/28840	I cant leave you alone in this abominable	68.25101470947266
7801/28840	So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is	47.264617919921875
7802/28840	I want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the kings	76.60509490966797
7803/28840	A man in a mask cried Ath	74.63358306884766
7804/28840	You did not let the executioner escape then   The executioner is still in the cellar where I presume he has had an interview with mine hosts	59.281558990478516
7805/28840	Mousqueton   Sir answered a voice from the depths of the	28.67135238647461
7806/28840	But said Athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king   An amateur headsman replied Aramis who however does not handle the axe am	68.16793823242188
7807/28840	Did you not see his face asked Ath	60.642948150634766
7808/28840	But you Aramis who were close to him   I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the	41.232845306396484
7809/28840	Then it must be a man of a certain	51.883949279785156
7810/28840	When one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under	99.85742950439453
7811/28840	I am sorry I did not follow him said Porth	22.150110244750977
7812/28840	Well my dear Porthos said DArtagnan thats the very thing it came into my head to	25.699026107788086
7813/28840	I have distrusted God I could the more easily distrust	141.51402282714844
7814/28840	We will see about that presently said DArtagnan with a slight	31.414182662963867
7815/28840	I was looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black	91.37947082519531
7816/28840	Humph thought I that looks like my handiwork I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or	355.7394104003906
7817/28840	And in fact it was that unfortunate Scotchman Parrys brother you know on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his	70.36905670166016
7818/28840	Well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around I recognized the honest Grim	137.8883056640625
7819/28840	Grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the	114.38006591796875
7820/28840	Eh said he which meant Do you see him Parbleu I answered and we perfectly understood one	140.4800567626953
7821/28840	Well everything was finished as you	150.5308837890625
7822/28840	I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the	37.535675048828125
7823/28840	I saw the executioner return into the kings room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and	67.2425537109375
7824/28840	Five minutes later he came down the grand	111.38341522216797
7825/28840	I should think so but not without	76.15151977539062
7826/28840	Every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal	157.8008270263672
7827/28840	I might have gone up to him and killed	41.43848419189453
7828/28840	But I am not selfish and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the	53.33867263793945
7829/28840	So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hours time he stopped before a little isolated	62.79344177246094
7830/28840	The man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being	65.03364562988281
7831/28840	Grimaud and I got behind a tree and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the	84.77252197265625
7832/28840	Next moment the door opened and the man	48.7531623840332
7833/28840	While you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find	61.401222229003906
7834/28840	Come now Aramis said DArtagnan you must be taking me for some one	28.286815643310547
7835/28840	Nevertheless said Athos in your absence   Well in my absence havent I put in my place Grimaud and the Scotchman Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined the house on all	53.15346908569336
7836/28840	At one of the doors that by which he had entered I placed our Scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out	56.65888595581055
7837/28840	Then going around the house I placed Grimaud at the other exit and here I	112.19293975830078
7838/28840	Friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me I was wrong a hundred times	66.88701629638672
7839/28840	I ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us	55.3237190246582
7840/28840	Dont you think the executioner might be Master Cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself   Ah just	67.99996948242188
7841/28840	Cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than	341.36444091796875
7842/28840	Some condemned soldier perhaps suggested Athos whom they have pardoned at the price of reg	149.76565551757812
7843/28840	No no continued DArtagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horse	55.40592575073242
7844/28840	If I am not mistaken we have to do with a	25.2916316986084
7845/28840	Impossible It would be a dishonor to all the	97.9916000366211
7846/28840	Fine sport by Jove cried Porthos with a laugh that shook the	64.60421752929688
7847/28840	Fine sport   Are you still bent on departure Athos asked DArtagn	46.181358337402344
7848/28840	No I remain replied Athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was	80.59504699707031
7849/28840	Swords then cried Aramis swords let us not lose a	107.08441162109375
7850/28840	The four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their	75.00554656982422
7851/28840	The night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and	435.8489685058594
7852/28840	DArtagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in	32.292545318603516
7853/28840	For a moment DArtagnan thought that Parrys brother had disappeared but he was	31.214221954345703
7854/28840	The robust Scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover	116.67172241210938
7855/28840	Come said Athos heres another good	102.21018981933594
7856/28840	Really honest men are not so scarce as I	81.61248779296875
7857/28840	Dont be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotch	50.37593078613281
7858/28840	I believe the fellow is here on his own account for I have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the Tweed are very vind	53.605224609375
7859/28840	I should not like to be Groslow if he meets	39.318965911865234
7860/28840	Well said Athos to the man in	39.124263763427734
7861/28840	No one has come out he	146.7183074951172
7862/28840	Well has anybody come out   No but somebody has gone	82.87805938720703
7863/28840	A man or a woman   A	39.1124153137207
7864/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan there are two of them then   I wish there were four said Athos the two parties would then be	41.77113723754883
7865/28840	What do you mean   Other men may have entered before them and waited for	57.45384979248047
7866/28840	At the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light	36.36869812011719
7867/28840	That is true said DArtagnan let us call the	17.093942642211914
7868/28840	They returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aram	39.9218635559082
7869/28840	No but we are going to replied DArtagnan pointing to Grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the	23.567838668823242
7870/28840	Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when	186.1060028076172
7871/28840	Then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was	72.25051879882812
7872/28840	Grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread	376.94683837890625
7873/28840	Speak said Athos we cannot see your	125.67385864257812
7874/28840	How many are there  	136.3972625732422
7875/28840	One opposite to me the other with his back to	68.50627899169922
7876/28840	And the man opposite to you is   The man I saw go	94.4220199584961
7877/28840	Do you know him   I thought I recognized him and was not	25.754125595092773
7878/28840	Who is it they all asked together in a low	88.26433563232422
7879/28840	The four friends looked at one	73.95729064941406
7880/28840	The executioner said DArtagnan and Aramis at the same	11.507169723510742
7881/28840	I can see nothing but his back resumed Grim	64.50983428955078
7882/28840	He is moving and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to	35.05686950683594
7883/28840	Ah   And as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a gro	53.020347595214844
7884/28840	Did you see him they all	112.41936492919922
7885/28840	Yes said Grimaud with his hair standing on	46.271644592285156
7886/28840	The thin spare man  	122.52320861816406
7887/28840	Heheis murmured Grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his masters	94.2079086303711
7888/28840	DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of	5.5859375
7889/28840	Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his	50.44294738769531
7890/28840	It was in fact Mordaunt whom DArtagnan had followed without knowing	47.25885772705078
7891/28840	On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a	73.99263763427734
7892/28840	Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London unknown except to the most intimate of his	68.53362274169922
7893/28840	General I wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed	67.60578918457031
7894/28840	Ah I scarcely thought you were so curious as	70.47977447509766
7895/28840	I am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of	61.795223236083984
7896/28840	But you general were you not at Whitehall   No said Crom	47.32598114013672
7897/28840	Have you had any account of it  	63.09231185913086
7898/28840	I have been here since the	37.51477813720703
7899/28840	I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the	37.28577423095703
7900/28840	Four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich where a vessel was	86.60116577148438
7901/28840	And knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and	193.73577880859375
7902/28840	But who told you I was inactive   Butif the plot had succeeded   I wished it to do	69.95851135253906
7903/28840	I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles	113.99081420898438
7904/28840	as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of	120.16452026367188
7905/28840	Yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaff	117.53011322021484
7906/28840	Because it could have been said that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of	77.27460479736328
7907/28840	But if he had escaped   Impossible my precautions were	100.66226959228516
7908/28840	And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him   The four Frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by Mazarin to	56.257545471191406
7909/28840	And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done   It is	38.740657806396484
7910/28840	How so   Because they	124.08161926269531
7911/28840	Your honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for Charles	55.83342361450195
7912/28840	Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against England will your honor give me all four of them   Take them said Crom	71.10477447509766
7913/28840	Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant fer	157.6068878173828
7914/28840	Did the people shout at all Cromwell	190.77674865722656
7915/28840	Very little except Long live Cromwell   Where were you placed   Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew	61.430564880371094
7916/28840	But his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwell	51.79246139526367
7917/28840	I was so situated as to hear and see everything he	85.16593170166016
7918/28840	It was now Cromwells turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt and Mordaunt to make himself impenetr	44.066688537597656
7919/28840	It appears said Cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably	74.64529418945312
7920/28840	The blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters	166.57156372070312
7921/28840	Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or	102.50390625
7922/28840	In fact said Mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow suffic	31.490144729614258
7923/28840	Perhaps it was some one in that occupation said Crom	80.68052673339844
7924/28840	Do you think so sir He did not look like an execution	53.46665954589844
7925/28840	And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office   But said Mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this	60.09059524536133
7926/28840	And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action   It is not for me to	54.896507263183594
7927/28840	It rests between his conscience and his	315.3406677246094
7928/28840	But if your honor knew this man   I neither know nor wish to know	72.65742492675781
7929/28840	Provided Charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must	371.7779541015625
7930/28840	And yet without the man the king would have been	101.61295318603516
7931/28840	They would have carried him to Greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the	85.55016326904297
7932/28840	Once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest Mord	88.47380828857422
7933/28840	Yes they would have all been blown	77.29358673095703
7934/28840	The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to	128.14987182617188
7935/28840	Men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by	93.58934783935547
7936/28840	You see now why I did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions I could not thank him for what he has	64.93699645996094
7937/28840	Sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was	51.378814697265625
7938/28840	Say absurd since it has become	225.22427368164062
7939/28840	The only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear	423.6520690917969
7940/28840	So tonight Mordaunt go to Greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca	46.7416877746582
7941/28840	Oh my lord my lord   That title said Cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in	63.08308029174805
7942/28840	But your honor will soon be called so	222.98202514648438
7943/28840	I hope so at least said Cromwell rising and putting on his	46.122352600097656
7944/28840	You are going sir   Yes said Crom	19.67202377319336
7945/28840	I slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same	55.98068618774414
7946/28840	Then said Mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for tonight   And even for all day tomorrow if you want	80.7488784790039
7947/28840	Since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that I should give you	68.6766128540039
7948/28840	Thank you sir it will be well employed I	86.21340942382812
7949/28840	And no one waiting for you outside  	78.63438415527344
7950/28840	Then you had better come with	82.09268188476562
7951/28840	Thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to	60.680809020996094
7952/28840	Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered	50.30754089355469
7953/28840	It closed after him with a	87.18688201904297
7954/28840	This door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future	33.17695999145508
7955/28840	It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated	97.44071197509766
7956/28840	DArtagnan was the first to recover from his	19.991985321044922
7957/28840	Ah by Heaven it is God Himself who sent us	163.22288513183594
7958/28840	Yes said Porthos let us break the door in and fall upon	27.556570053100586
7959/28840	Now Grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to	59.325477600097656
7960/28840	If he comes out we shall catch	84.1701889038086
7961/28840	If he stays in we will break in the	141.9371337890625
7962/28840	It is easier and less noisy than the	114.46015930175781
7963/28840	Grimaud began to scale the wall	365.2633361816406
7964/28840	Keep guard at the other door Athos and Aram	20.949413299560547
7965/28840	We did not see his companion come	62.79008102416992
7966/28840	He may have gone by the other	90.66908264160156
7967/28840	What is he doing   Putting on his cloak and	59.113861083984375
7968/28840	Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabb	35.85758972167969
7969/28840	Put it up again my friend said DArtagn	33.08082962036133
7970/28840	We must proceed in an orderly	205.26116943359375
7971/28840	Hush said Grimaud he is coming	72.7684097290039
7972/28840	He has put out the lamp I can see nothing	122.03791809082031
7973/28840	The snow deadened the noise of his	226.85546875
7974/28840	Now go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch	41.176513671875
7975/28840	The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with DArtagn	30.222402572631836
7976/28840	Porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running	66.63008880615234
7977/28840	Mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for	321.31866455078125
7978/28840	DArtagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no	77.59073638916016
7979/28840	At last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before Mordaunt had been talking to Crom	73.22822570800781
7980/28840	Porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the	68.04457092285156
7981/28840	Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door behind	68.01557159423828
7982/28840	Oblige me by taking a seat said DArtagnan pushing a chair toward Mordaunt who sat down pale but	130.6820068359375
7983/28840	Aramis Porthos and DArtagnan drew their chairs near	30.553964614868164
7984/28840	Athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the	87.33322143554688
7985/28840	Porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impat	36.92449951171875
7986/28840	Aramis bit his lips till the blood	144.41912841796875
7987/28840	DArtagnan alone was calm at least in	46.82732009887695
7988/28840	Monsieur Mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you	65.8346176147461
7989/28840	Though Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of	108.30845642089844
7990/28840	His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right	107.05867004394531
7991/28840	DArtagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said	27.272005081176758
7992/28840	Aramis muttered to himself We shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace	112.83089447021484
7993/28840	Porthos sucked his mustache muttering A good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an add	298.84124755859375
7994/28840	Athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrel	117.14801788330078
7995/28840	The silence however could not last	585.4432373046875
7996/28840	Just now DArtagnan continued you were disguisedI mean to say attiredas a murderer and now   And now I look very much like a man who is going to be	47.19642639160156
7997/28840	Oh sir said DArtagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side   No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and dag	47.20728302001953
7998/28840	I had the honor of asking you why you altered your	96.46902465820312
7999/28840	The mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this	79.19452667236328
8000/28840	Why then have you laid it aside   Because remembering the scene at Armentieres I thought I should find four axes for one as I was to meet four execution	55.241764068603516
8001/28840	Sir replied DArtagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young I shall therefore overlook your frivolous	59.59366226196289
8002/28840	What took place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present	62.912750244140625
8003/28840	We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight	112.74833679199219
8004/28840	Aha It is a duel then cried Mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the	79.46268463134766
8005/28840	Porthos rose always ready for this kind of	144.95298767089844
8006/28840	Do not let us do things in a	75.84740447998047
8007/28840	We will arrange the matter rather	454.86920166015625
8008/28840	Confess Monsieur Mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of	41.37556838989258
8009/28840	Then my dear sir I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you	61.50084686279297
8010/28840	Of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof I can furnish is this   So saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French	65.1385498046875
8011/28840	My sword is shorter than yours its true but bah I think the arm will make up for the	225.79234313964844
8012/28840	He might have been taken for a	39.78806686401367
8013/28840	Even his breathing seemed to be	203.80972290039062
8014/28840	Gentlemen said DArtagnan you shall have your	59.094749450683594
8015/28840	Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you	57.77230453491211
8016/28840	You can see it in his	91.90924072265625
8017/28840	So pray keep your places like Athos whose calmness is entirely laud	100.480224609375
8018/28840	Besides we will have no words about	90.89031982421875
8019/28840	I have particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will	103.75211334228516
8020/28840	Porthos and Aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword DArtagnan turned to his adversary   Sir I am waiting for	19.000768661499023
8021/28840	And for my part gentlemen I admire	105.6753158569336
8022/28840	You are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the	68.56912231445312
8023/28840	I hate you all but not	194.50035095214844
8024/28840	I hope to kill all four of you but I am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the	67.00643157958984
8025/28840	I claim then the right to choose my	223.97637939453125
8026/28840	If you refuse this right you may kill me but I shall not	58.65430450439453
8027/28840	It is but fair said Porthos and Aramis hoping he would choose one of	35.321380615234375
8028/28840	Athos and DArtagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply	64.43912506103516
8029/28840	Well then said Mordaunt I choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called Comte de la Fere calls himself Ath	53.59825897216797
8030/28840	Athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends Monsieur Mordaunt a duel between us is	45.58403015136719
8031/28840	Ah said Mordaunt with a sneer theres one who is	39.44715881347656
8032/28840	Zounds exclaimed DArtagnan bounding toward him who says that Athos is afraid   Let him have his say DArtagnan said Athos with a smile of sadness and	38.218040466308594
8033/28840	Is it your decision Athos resumed the Gas	104.6769027709961
8034/28840	You hear sir said DArtagnan turning to Mord	14.750163078308105
8035/28840	The Comte de la Fere will not do you the honor of fighting with	14.282541275024414
8036/28840	Choose one of us to replace the Comte de la F	17.145294189453125
8037/28840	As long as I dont fight with him it is the same to me with whom I	58.280723571777344
8038/28840	Put your names into a hat and draw	252.376708984375
8039/28840	At least that will conciliate us all said Aram	55.8292236328125
8040/28840	I should never have thought of that said Porthos and yet it is very	19.943113327026367
8041/28840	Come Aramis said DArtagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of	62.242122650146484
8042/28840	Mordaunt sustained this new attack without win	925.9639892578125
8043/28840	He stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such	82.88038635253906
8044/28840	If he had not courage he had what is very like it namely	177.4268341064453
8045/28840	He then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to Mord	84.15365600585938
8046/28840	Mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading	98.7425537109375
8047/28840	Ah serpent muttered DArtagnan I would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my	50.13848876953125
8048/28840	Aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read DArtagn	56.25217819213867
8049/28840	The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt   I hope sir said he you have no objection to	19.9688720703125
8050/28840	None whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his	113.02651977539062
8051/28840	The moment that DArtagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquill	44.95829772949219
8052/28840	He turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him in a singular	58.75762939453125
8053/28840	Are you ready sir he said at	74.8106689453125
8054/28840	I was waiting for you sir said Mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to	35.580833435058594
8055/28840	Well then said the Gascon take care of yourself for I am not a bad hand at the rap	39.269412994384766
8056/28840	So much the better that sets my mind at	88.87723541259766
8057/28840	Give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the	82.37162780761719
8058/28840	Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper   No but to set my mind at rest as you observed just	60.17512512207031
8059/28840	It is for something else than that I imagine muttered DArtagnan shaking his head doubt	44.664554595947266
8060/28840	On the honor of gentlemen said Aramis and Porth	22.52939224243164
8061/28840	In that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample	125.10740661621094
8062/28840	Yes gentlemen said DArtagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect I fancy he is anxious still to	67.80805969238281
8063/28840	This new attack made no impression on Mord	91.31448364257812
8064/28840	The space was cleared the two lamps placed on Cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords	92.9189224243164
8065/28840	DArtagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his	36.01407241821289
8066/28840	He made a rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt par	121.02909851074219
8067/28840	Aha he cried with a smile of	69.75968170166016
8068/28840	And without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding	131.1609649658203
8069/28840	This time it was Mordaunt who	77.94286346435547
8070/28840	Ah sir said DArtagnan you have a wicked	18.80638885498047
8071/28840	Ah you lose ground you are turning Well as you please I even gain something by it for I no longer see that wicked smile of	165.4005889892578
8072/28840	You have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are	113.416748046875
8073/28840	Look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown youa frank and honorable count	123.77043914794922
8074/28840	To this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of DArtagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponents attention Mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with DArtagn	73.96476745605469
8075/28840	He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon	70.34550476074219
8076/28840	Come come cried DArtagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a	85.56505584716797
8077/28840	However as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever Mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left	75.7021484375
8078/28840	Ah this time you cannot lose ground my fine friend exclaimed DArtagn	60.52239990234375
8079/28840	Gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall	196.56890869140625
8080/28840	Well then you shall see it	99.86138916015625
8081/28840	In a second DArtagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked	90.10783386230469
8082/28840	The three friends looked on panting and	197.35630798339844
8083/28840	DArtagnan sprang back the wall had closed	44.56908416748047
8084/28840	Mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which Cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and	110.12061309814453
8085/28840	The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron	38.77362823486328
8086/28840	Help me gentlemen cried DArtagnan we must break in this	48.008663177490234
8087/28840	It is the devil in person said Aramis hastening	94.38447570800781
8088/28840	He escapes us growled Porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in	100.8744125366211
8089/28840	I thought as much said DArtagnan wasting his strength in useless	81.408935546875
8090/28840	Zounds I thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the	226.80809020996094
8091/28840	I thought he was up to	133.46807861328125
8092/28840	Its a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said Aram	57.11620330810547
8093/28840	Its a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven said Athos evidently much	113.001953125
8094/28840	Really said DArtagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts Athos I cannot imagine how you can talk to us in that	54.93576431274414
8095/28840	You cannot understand the position we are	65.74103546142578
8096/28840	In this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be	169.98468017578125
8097/28840	This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred ironsided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this	112.84832763671875
8098/28840	If we stay here five minutes more theres an end of	111.67169952392578
8099/28840	But where shall we go asked Porth	26.786508560180664
8100/28840	To the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please God to France where at least I understand the architecture of the	95.172607421875
8101/28840	So suiting the action to the word DArtagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the	34.292823791503906
8102/28840	DArtagnan had judged correctly Mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost	32.848934173583984

8104/28840	This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of	66.06404876708984
8105/28840	After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take	68.36405944824219
8106/28840	Good he said nothing almost nothingscratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the	172.03024291992188
8107/28840	The wounds that I make are better than thatwitness the executioner of Bethune my uncle and King	72.49968719482422
8108/28840	Now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save	230.31576538085938
8109/28840	They must diedie all togetherkilled at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of	219.2517547607422
8110/28840	I will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they	95.79930114746094
8111/28840	Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league	115.5224609375
8112/28840	He made that quarter of a league in four or five	47.60913848876953
8113/28840	Arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high	107.1458511352539
8114/28840	A quarter of an hour later he was at	35.376976013183594
8115/28840	That dark point yonder is the Isle of	195.01158142089844
8116/28840	Good I am half an hour in advance of them an hour	70.24846649169922
8117/28840	Fool that I was I have almost killed myself by my needless	197.72999572753906
8118/28840	Now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which I wonder is the Lightning   At this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward	51.13346481323242
8119/28840	Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to	65.73564147949219
8120/28840	He was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his	67.052978515625
8121/28840	Do you wish to go on the water sir said the	57.4725341796875
8122/28840	And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than	178.6887664794922
8123/28840	You would like one that sails as rapidly as   Lightning interrupted Mord	171.0574951171875
8124/28840	Then mine is the boat you want	235.44735717773438
8125/28840	I begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain	62.851402282714844
8126/28840	Here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each	43.33644104003906
8127/28840	Good quite right cried Mordaunt springing off his	101.41956329345703
8128/28840	Theres not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your	128.59788513183594
8129/28840	But asked the sailor where are your companions I thought there were four of	111.3525619506836
8130/28840	Im not the man you take me for you are in Captain Rogerss post are you not under orders from General Crom	73.91403198242188
8131/28840	Mine also are from him   Indeed sir I recognize you you are Captain Mord	71.0645751953125
8132/28840	Oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his	135.17735290527344
8133/28840	The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this	79.04380798339844
8134/28840	Is there anything new in the wind  	126.74532318115234
8135/28840	I thought perhaps that the kings death   Has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be	63.71162033081055
8136/28840	What have you come for then   To embark with	48.12021255493164
8137/28840	Ah ah the general doubted my fidelity   No but I wish to have a share in my	76.58365631103516
8138/28840	Havent you some one who will relieve me of my horse   Groslow whistled and a sailor	61.61885452270508
8139/28840	Patrick said Groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest	39.45161437988281
8140/28840	If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish	106.46107482910156
8141/28840	Now said Mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you   There is no danger dressed as I am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as	58.61874008178711
8142/28840	Besides even you didnt recognize me they will be much less likely	104.05413818359375
8143/28840	That is true said Mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of	35.043052673339844
8144/28840	Everything is ready is it not  	47.61963653564453
8145/28840	The cargo on board  	33.2271842956543
8146/28840	Five full casks   And fifty empty	199.73031616210938
8147/28840	We are carrying port wine to An	573.3020629882812
8148/28840	Now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be	83.15110778808594
8149/28840	It is important that none of your crew should see	166.2965850830078
8150/28840	I have but one man on board and I am as sure of him as I am of	31.869619369506836
8151/28840	Besides he doesnt know you like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our	127.61727905273438
8152/28840	They then went down to the	137.9461212158203
8153/28840	A boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a	105.23673248291016
8154/28840	Groslow jumped in followed by Mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of London and Mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of	84.52396392822266
8155/28840	When they reached the side of this felucca Mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among lands	66.2324447631836
8156/28840	He went with Groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the	41.30419921875
8157/28840	They will have nothing to do then at this end said Mord	65.32754516601562
8158/28840	Return to Greenwich and bring them	214.68197631835938
8159/28840	I shall hide myself in your	75.05624389648438
8160/28840	You have a longboat   That in which we	52.15729904174805
8161/28840	Fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the	81.3363037109375
8162/28840	Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves	79.41211700439453
8163/28840	Do you wish to see the powderroom  	36.613792419433594
8164/28840	When you return I will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by	122.9471664428711
8165/28840	Groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached	117.3495101928711
8166/28840	The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved	58.376399993896484
8167/28840	These horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of DArtagnan and Ath	52.25872039794922
8168/28840	As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they	44.658748626708984
8169/28840	Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst DArtagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watch	55.94468688964844
8170/28840	On seeing the appointed signal Groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the	70.3904037475586
8171/28840	What do you want with us he asked of Gros	33.54362869262695
8172/28840	I wish to inform you my lord replied Groslow with an Irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find	27.097013473510742
8173/28840	He fell down this morning and broke his	150.08013916015625
8174/28840	Was that all he said inquired Ath	97.33000946044922
8175/28840	No my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port you choose in	69.36405944824219
8176/28840	What do you think of all this said Athos in a low tone to DArtagnan after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in	29.318126678466797
8177/28840	It seems a likely story to	314.2222900390625
8178/28840	Besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the Gascon and you Athos you know something of everything and can be our	88.97938537597656
8179/28840	I dare say you know how to navigate should he fail	71.952880859375
8180/28840	My father meant me for the navy and I have some vague notions about	138.3385772705078
8181/28840	Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and	110.35852813720703
8182/28840	Parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to France but he had straightway	347.4739990234375
8183/28840	It is very simple Mousqueton had said he is thinking of Gros	61.99668502807617
8184/28840	It was Captain Groslow the reader will remember who had broken Parrys	93.25867462158203
8185/28840	DArtagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with	104.13822937011719
8186/28840	He found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too	294.0464782714844
8187/28840	He had reported to Aramis what had taken place and Aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his	50.37959289550781
8188/28840	A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascons uneas	69.95357513427734
8189/28840	We have no time now for suspicions said Ath	73.69755554199219
8190/28840	The boat is waiting for us	106.04916381835938
8191/28840	Besides said Aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time We can watch the sk	78.88085174560547
8192/28840	And if he doesnt go straight I will crush him thats	134.64031982421875
8193/28840	You first Mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the	65.37491607666016
8194/28840	Athos followed them then Porthos then Aram	76.61079406738281
8195/28840	DArtagnan went last still shaking his	53.615413665771484
8196/28840	What in the devil is the matter with you my friend said Porth	14.972493171691895
8197/28840	Upon my word you would make Caesar	131.59083557128906
8198/28840	The matter is replied DArtagnan that I can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor excis	84.05668640136719
8199/28840	And you complain of that said Porth	30.300052642822266
8200/28840	Everything goes as if in flowery	141.47488403320312
8201/28840	But no matter we must trust in	191.91122436523438
8202/28840	As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boathook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were	60.94213104248047
8203/28840	The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to	103.60498046875
8204/28840	As soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more	91.93111419677734
8205/28840	At last we are off exclaimed Porth	64.20271301269531
8206/28840	Yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a	106.17819213867188
8207/28840	We are not yet at our destination observed the prudent DArtagnan beware of misad	51.25344467163086
8208/28840	Ah my friend cried Porthos like the crows you always bring bad om	98.31524658203125
8209/28840	Who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one   Yes but tomorrow morning   Tomorrow we shall be at Boulog	49.97612762451172
8210/28840	I hope so with all my heart said the Gascon and I confess my	35.888057708740234
8211/28840	Yes Athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush	51.6717643737793
8212/28840	But said Porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the	47.189640045166016
8213/28840	You dont imagine he would consider a little thing like that   At any rate said Porthos I am glad to hear DArtagnan admit that he is	25.54902458190918
8214/28840	I not only confess it but am proud of it returned the Gascon Im not such a rhinoceros as you	64.5285415649414
8215/28840	Oho whats that   The Lightning answered the captain our felu	64.05559539794922
8216/28840	They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for thema cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some	78.66614532470703
8217/28840	Stop a moment cried DArtagnan pray how many men have you on board captain   I dont understand was the	49.76871109008789
8218/28840	Groslow on the question being interpreted answered Three without counting	380.3493347167969
8219/28840	DArtagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three	106.34053802490234
8220/28840	Oh he exclaimed I begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves I shall make the round of the	160.87120056152344
8221/28840	As for me said Porthos I will see to the	30.09913444519043
8222/28840	A very good idea Porthos said the Gas	39.5423583984375
8223/28840	Athos lend me Grimaud who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little English and can act as my	96.26114654541016
8224/28840	DArtagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in English Come being with the classic English oath the only English words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower	74.68681335449219
8225/28840	Oho cried DArtagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of Ali Bab	42.52658462524414
8226/28840	What is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the cas	70.2780532836914
8227/28840	The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered   Port	201.31773376464844
8228/28840	Ah port wine tis a comfort said the Gascon since we shall not die of	67.59721374511719
8229/28840	Are they all full   Grimaud translated the question and Groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered   Some full others	81.32373809814453
8230/28840	Stop said the Englishman I have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing	35.877838134765625
8231/28840	Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third	115.95536041259766
8232/28840	This was the room appropriated to the	67.69165802001953
8233/28840	Two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire	179.9834442138672
8234/28840	DArtagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the	52.110923767089844
8235/28840	And this room he asked pointing to the captains	123.58785247802734
8236/28840	DArtagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed   Good he	40.7962646484375
8237/28840	If there is an army on board it is not here that it is	57.971126556396484
8238/28840	Let us see what Porthos has found for	70.2544937133789
8239/28840	And thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends	181.18406677246094
8240/28840	Porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over	145.27931213378906
8241/28840	He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when DArtagnan	33.7950439453125
8242/28840	Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in	110.13311004638672

8245/28840	Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a val	83.819091796875
8246/28840	On a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three	104.70630645751953
8247/28840	I know it will serve me as it did when we came	63.71793746948242
8248/28840	And to think said Mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop	72.63148498535156
8249/28840	Pah   But where is your wicker flask Monsieur Mousqueton Have you lost it asked Blais	25.243316650390625
8250/28840	And you Grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with DArtagnan are you thirsty   As thirsty as a Scotchman was Grimauds laconic	56.685096740722656
8251/28840	And he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he	89.20530700683594
8252/28840	Oh lackadaisy Im beginning to feel queer cried Blais	201.58544921875

8254/28840	Do you call that nourishment said Blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the	73.19168090820312
8255/28840	Blaisois replied Mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a Frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask Grim	85.5764389038086
8256/28840	Yes but beer asked Blaisois sharply is that their true drink   As to that answered Mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the	71.95861053466797
8257/28840	What Monsieur Mousqueton The Englishdo they dislike wine   They hate	73.98223114013672
8258/28840	But I have seen them drink	93.99504089355469

8263/28840	How asked Blaisois I can Explain	72.94910430908203
8264/28840	Grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the	183.04083251953125
8265/28840	Port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by DArtagnan and	24.280357360839844
8266/28840	Eh eh ah Those barrels I saw through the door   Port replied Grimaud beginning a fresh	169.5076904296875
8267/28840	I have heard said Blaisois that port is a very good	47.510772705078125
8268/28840	Excellent there is port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracie	27.057830810546875
8269/28840	Suppose we ask these Englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest Blais	167.25311279296875
8270/28840	Sell cried Mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character	197.26156616210938
8271/28840	One may well perceive young man that you are	291.4982604980469
8272/28840	Why buy what one can take   Take said Blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor That is forbidden it seems to	80.9427490234375
8273/28840	In the commandments of God or of the church I dont know	77.0121078491211
8274/28840	I only know it says Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his	178.41188049316406
8275/28840	That is a childs reason Monsieur Blaisois said Mousqueton in his most patronizing	28.77676773071289
8276/28840	Yes you talk like a childI repeat the	108.4916000366211
8277/28840	Where have you read in the Scriptures I ask you that the English are your neighbors   Where that is true said Blaisois at least I cant now recall	43.755733489990234
8278/28840	A childs reasonI repeat it continued Mousqu	79.3243179321289
8279/28840	If you had been ten years engaged in war as Grimaud and I have been my dear Blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of	50.12681198120117
8280/28840	Now an Englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the English therefore it belongs to	110.3294906616211
8281/28840	And our masters asked Blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion   Mousqueton smiled disdain	40.9387321472168
8282/28840	I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say Gentlemen your servant Mousqueton is	62.71548843383789
8283/28840	What does Monsieur Bracieux care think you whether I am thirsty or not   Tis a very expensive wine said Blaisois shaking his	33.83573532104492
8284/28840	Were it liquid gold Monsieur Blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this	223.4439697265625
8285/28840	Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every	34.92774963378906
8286/28840	His manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine	86.01971435546875
8287/28840	Ah locked he exclaimed these devils of English how suspicious they are   Locked said Blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more	88.23194122314453
8288/28840	Perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in	108.21501922607422
8289/28840	I cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move with a packthread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred	84.64960479736328
8290/28840	No but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered Blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gim	37.656272888183594
8291/28840	Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him	65.25736999511719
8292/28840	Tis true he said but where can I get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask   Trousers said Grimaud still squaring his	57.84069061279297
8293/28840	Grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate	83.81758117675781
8294/28840	Mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his	81.29357147216797
8295/28840	In a few minutes he had extracted three	59.683807373046875
8296/28840	He tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get	78.14427185058594
8297/28840	He sighed and set to work	314.799072265625
8298/28840	That is true said Mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will pass	56.508758544921875
8299/28840	And he knows the full casks said Blaisois for he has already been in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier dArtagn	21.308034896850586
8300/28840	Let Monsieur Grimaud go in Monsieur M	19.79043960571289
8301/28840	I could go in as well as Grimaud said Mousqueton a little piqu	38.01731872558594
8302/28840	Yes but that would take too much time and I am	60.99681854248047
8303/28840	I am getting more and more seas	43.4510498046875
8304/28840	Go in then Grimaud said Mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gim	70.239990234375
8305/28840	Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and	72.43585968017578
8306/28840	Blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstas	36.85283660888672
8307/28840	Of all the exploits performed since their arrival in England by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most	116.43323516845703
8308/28840	You are about to see said Mousqueton looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see Blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are	33.88175964355469
8309/28840	My cloak said Grimaud from the bottom of the	90.02632141113281
8310/28840	My cloakstop up the aperture with	134.26443481445312
8311/28840	Simpleton exclaimed Mousqueton suppose any one came into the	93.95103454589844
8312/28840	Ah true cried Blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the	57.87114715576172
8313/28840	Grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered Mousqu	300.1911926269531
8314/28840	As for me when I have no candle I cant take two steps without knocking against	108.37438201904297
8315/28840	Thats because you havent served said Mousqu	103.80481719970703
8316/28840	Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed	65.75824737548828
8317/28840	But hark I think some one is	165.39230346679688
8318/28840	Mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his	44.2575569152832
8319/28840	The door of their cabin was	181.97276306152344
8320/28840	Two men wrapped in their cloaks	78.5053939819336
8321/28840	Oho said they not in bed at a quarter past	175.11984252929688
8322/28840	In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and sn	55.01629638671875
8323/28840	These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after	100.08582305908203
8324/28840	Ah cried Blaisois he is lost   Grimauds a cunning fellow murmured Mousqu	27.203197479248047
8325/28840	They said a quarter of an	54.5776252746582
8326/28840	We still have five minutes replied Mousqu	50.806766510009766
8327/28840	We should have heard the blow	116.4920425415039
8328/28840	But if he doesnt return   Here he	29.15346908569336
8329/28840	At that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around	80.23709106445312
8330/28840	Both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gun	49.89590835571289
8331/28840	Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine Grimaud hastened to awake DArtagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken	46.294986724853516
8332/28840	Imposing silence Grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it p	120.68568420410156
8333/28840	This was the gist of his strange story   The first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was	78.95111083984375
8334/28840	He passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently	245.85447692871094
8335/28840	He was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing	85.75343322753906
8336/28840	His face was hidden under the wide brim of his	68.17076873779297
8337/28840	Grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great	74.25528717041016
8338/28840	Have you the wick asked the one who carried the	156.5048065185547
8339/28840	At the voice of this last speaker Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very	91.18582153320312
8340/28840	He rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of Mord	69.9312973022461
8341/28840	How long will this fuse burn asked this	853.7423706054688
8342/28840	That voice also was known to Grim	132.37977600097656
8343/28840	He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he recognized Gros	54.67805480957031
8344/28840	Then tell the men to be in readinessdont tell them why	184.01019287109375
8345/28840	When the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your	795.8630981445312
8346/28840	That is when I have lighted the match   I will undertake	38.95081329345703
8347/28840	I wish to be sure of my	25.71579360961914
8348/28840	Are the oars in the boat   Everything is	44.86507797241211
8349/28840	Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the	64.014404296875
8350/28840	You hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty	305.5257263183594
8351/28840	Grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood	110.40911102294922
8352/28840	But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the	182.77943420410156
8353/28840	He had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen Mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which Mordaunt had given in	41.289451599121094
8354/28840	Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and Mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse	53.1695556640625
8355/28840	At the door he stopped to	128.6710662841797
8356/28840	Do you hear how they sleep he	213.98834228515625
8357/28840	In fact Porthos could be heard snoring through the	100.33467864990234
8358/28840	Tis God who gives them into our hands answered Gros	98.65072631835938
8359/28840	This time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined Mord	155.25364685058594
8360/28840	Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent	66.53074645996094
8361/28840	DArtagnan pressing his hand repeated his	52.37358856201172
8362/28840	Athos is near you said DArtagnan warn him as I have warned	45.2743034362793
8363/28840	Aramis easily aroused Athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized	86.05705261230469
8364/28840	But there was more difficulty in arousing Porth	34.878822326660156
8365/28840	He was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when DArtagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his	61.89268112182617
8366/28840	Then our Gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one	107.29682922363281
8367/28840	Friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead	116.168212890625
8368/28840	Bah said Athos are you still afraid   Do you know who is captain of this vessel  	25.919384002685547
8369/28840	The shudder of the three musketeers showed to DArtagnan that his words began to make some impression on	31.921667098999023
8370/28840	Groslow said Aramis the devil   Who is this Groslow asked Porth	26.68407440185547
8371/28840	Groslow is the man who broke Parrys head and is now getting ready to break	113.89529418945312
8372/28840	Oh oh   And do you know who is his lieutenant   His lieutenant There is none said Ath	42.29351043701172
8373/28840	They dont have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of	57.52303695678711
8374/28840	Yes but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mord	25.67383575439453
8375/28840	This time the musketeers did more than shudderthey almost cried	107.0465316772461
8376/28840	Those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with	170.01492309570312
8377/28840	We must seize the felucca said Aram	33.37199020385742
8378/28840	Those casks which I took for casks of port wine are filled with	114.0284423828125
8379/28840	When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to	156.8675537109375
8380/28840	You have some plan then asked Ath	63.84025573730469
8381/28840	What is it   Have you confidence in me   Give your orders said the three musket	24.360538482666016
8382/28840	DArtagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man	73.95940399169922
8383/28840	He turned it gently on its	135.70913696289062
8384/28840	The deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said Aram	38.87006378173828
8385/28840	Stay here if you like but I warn you twill be rather too warm	158.5966033935547
8386/28840	But we cannot swim to the	108.89149475097656
8387/28840	The longboat is yonder lashed to the felu	38.892696380615234
8388/28840	We will take possession of it and cut the	73.56073760986328
8389/28840	A moments delay said Athos our servants   Here we are they	62.9848518371582
8390/28840	Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which DArtagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the	58.5178108215332
8391/28840	Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry	97.39849090576172
8392/28840	Gracious Heaven we are hesitating cried DArtagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do   I do not hesitate you know said Grim	45.80884552001953
8393/28840	Sir interposed Blaisois I warn you that I can only swim in	26.49745750427246
8394/28840	And I not at all said Mousqu	44.025230407714844
8395/28840	But DArtagnan had now slipped through the	22.667476654052734
8396/28840	Yes the Gascon answered Athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over	176.98297119140625
8397/28840	Porthos kill every one who stands in your	91.0299072265625
8398/28840	And after pressing the hand of Athos DArtagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his	44.534423828125
8399/28840	Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the	73.3616714477539
8400/28840	DArtagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of	69.12682342529297
8401/28840	Then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of Aramis and Grim	64.47966766357422
8402/28840	I am uneasy about Blaisois said Athos he can he says only swim in	83.67605590820312
8403/28840	When people can swim at all they can swim	312.5063171386719
8404/28840	To the boat to the boat   But Porthos I do not see	23.411890029907227
8405/28840	But monsieur said Mousqueton I cant swim let me stay	23.3193416595459
8406/28840	I assure you I shall be very much in the way in that little boat said Mousqu	23.751590728759766
8407/28840	And I know I shall drown before reaching it continued Blais	143.1663055419922
8408/28840	Come along I shall strangle you both if you dont get out said Porthos at last seizing Mousqueton by the	57.35002899169922
8409/28840	A sublime action at all events for Mousqueton looked upon himself as	115.83373260498047
8410/28840	Ah have you your sword Athos cried DArtagn	29.333003997802734
8411/28840	Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the	67.81889343261719
8412/28840	The felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing	68.09001159667969
8413/28840	Come Athos said DArtagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the Gas	20.045061111450195
8414/28840	Scarcely had DArtagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the	29.63599395751953
8415/28840	That you may be sure said the Gascon means	49.973304748535156
8416/28840	They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind	102.21685791015625
8417/28840	Shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walk	150.7655029296875
8418/28840	In the midst of these screams they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in	45.579681396484375
8419/28840	The agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of Groslow who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the	118.23003387451172
8420/28840	Mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep sl	66.22644805908203
8421/28840	Then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom God blinds he had set fire to the wick of nit	85.32735443115234
8422/28840	All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on	67.19566345214844
8423/28840	Haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said Gros	120.32862091064453
8424/28840	One of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least	96.06946563720703
8425/28840	The cable is cut he cried no boat   How no boat exclaimed Groslow it is	136.6677703857422
8426/28840	Tis true however answered the sailor theres nothing in the wake of the ship besides heres the end of the	76.20993041992188
8427/28840	Whats the matter cried Mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his	87.7413101196289
8428/28840	Only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the	120.80660247802734
8429/28840	Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the	182.09104919433594
8430/28840	Empty he exclaimed the infernal demons   We must pursue them said Groslow they cant be gone far and we will sink them passing over	59.81178283691406
8431/28840	Yes but the fire ejaculated Mordaunt I have lighted	43.146026611328125
8432/28840	Ten thousand devils cried Groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save	56.25459289550781
8433/28840	Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after	229.8512420654297
8434/28840	The instant Groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a	82.18766021728516
8435/28840	Onlythe felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were	29.917953491210938
8436/28840	The four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped	95.27432250976562
8437/28840	Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around themthen at last the volcano was extinguishedthen all was dark and stillthe floating bark and heaving	200.99659729003906
8438/28840	By Heaven at last said Athos the first to speak by this time I think all must be	68.00729370117188
8439/28840	Here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the	106.70711517333984
8440/28840	Tis he it is his voice   All still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the	53.478633880615234
8441/28840	After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming	48.28211212158203
8442/28840	Athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his	109.28411865234375
8443/28840	Yes yes I see him well enough said DArtagn	15.438167572021484
8444/28840	Heagain cried Porthos who was breathing like a blacksmiths bellows why he is made of	77.42918395996094
8445/28840	Aramis and DArtagnan whispered to each	16.759750366210938
8446/28840	Mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves Pity pity on me gentlemen in Heavens name my strength is failing me I am	181.03199768066406
8447/28840	The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Ath	109.86995697021484
8448/28840	Indeed said DArtagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your	34.99241256713867
8449/28840	Does he think we are going to take him in Row Porthos	72.19035339355469
8450/28840	And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms	189.41021728515625
8451/28840	Oh you will not abandon me You will not leave me to perish You will not be pitiless cried Mord	42.89604187011719
8452/28840	Ah ah said Porthos to Mordaunt I think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of	57.9621467590332
8453/28840	Oh Porthos murmured the Comte de la F	6.584003925323486
8454/28840	Oh pray for mercys sake dont fly from	102.11918640136719
8455/28840	For pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters	95.48799133300781
8456/28840	DArtagnan however who had consulted with Aramis spoke to the poor w	32.70307159423828
8457/28840	Go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire	271.8826599121094
8458/28840	See the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed Monsieur Groslow and his	58.865203857421875
8459/28840	Sir replied Mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is	75.09262084960938
8460/28840	Gentlemen I am young scarcely twentythree years	274.1075744628906
8461/28840	I was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my	63.04158020019531
8462/28840	You would have done what I	32.299598693847656
8463/28840	Mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural	114.44766235351562
8464/28840	Alas he said I am then to die You are going to kill the son as you killed the mother Surely if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon I ought to be	63.24617004394531
8465/28840	Then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his	60.78382110595703
8466/28840	Oh this is torture to me cried Ath	56.362098693847656
8467/28840	DArtagnan DArtagnan cried Athos my son I entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save	35.69725036621094
8468/28840	I cannot resist doing so he must	84.74398803710938
8469/28840	Aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he sw	52.74092102050781
8470/28840	If he lays his hand on the boats edge I will cut it off regicide that he	84.74629211425781
8471/28840	What are you going to do asked Aram	13.655728340148926
8472/28840	Throw myself in the water and strangle	60.557586669921875
8473/28840	Oh gentlemen cried Athos be men be Christians See death is depicted on his face Ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse Grant me this poor wretchs	115.81837463378906
8474/28840	I will bless youI   I am dying cried Mordaunt come to me come to me   DArtagnan began to be	23.21465301513672
8475/28840	The boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Ath	93.64086151123047
8476/28840	Mordaunt made a last effortroseseized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of	121.48332977294922
8477/28840	Thats right said Athos put your other hand	176.68844604492188
8478/28840	And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been	129.29588317871094
8479/28840	Now sir said the count you are safecalm	44.759132385253906
8480/28840	Mute with horror the three friends had remained openmouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was	68.14405822753906
8481/28840	Porthos was the first who came to	33.211822509765625
8482/28840	In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbe	45.25503921508789
8483/28840	Mordaunt Mordaunt cried the three friends tis Mordaunt   But Athos exclaimed DArtagn	46.83474349975586
8484/28840	Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld Athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the	51.703765869140625
8485/28840	Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly Athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with	69.03199005126953
8486/28840	No replied Athos and he   Oh he now we may say at last thank Heaven he is really	57.19881057739258
8487/28840	Look and DArtagnan obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal	82.80364227294922
8488/28840	Athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were	90.3800048828125
8489/28840	Bravo Athos cried Aramis with an emotion very rare in	130.1962432861328
8490/28840	A capital blow you gave cried Porth	230.81654357910156
8491/28840	In short said DArtagnan this has been the will of	34.68109893798828
8492/28840	It was not I who killed him said Athos in a soft low tone twas	57.06399154663086
8493/28840	How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being	62.73439025878906
8494/28840	A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene	102.76779174804688
8495/28840	I have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what I have just	90.23918914794922
8496/28840	Nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation I protest that I feel	142.89682006835938
8497/28840	I have a hundred pounds weight less upon my	275.67144775390625
8498/28840	In fact Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful	100.00939178466797
8499/28840	For my part observed Aramis I cannot say the same as you do Porth	47.20744323730469
8500/28840	I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe my	64.3038558959961
8501/28840	I look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his	69.5325927734375
8502/28840	The poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his	63.49431610107422
8503/28840	I do not reproach you Athos for what you have	18.68021011352539
8504/28840	On the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to	102.93582153320312
8505/28840	So now I breathe againI am happy   Dont be in haste to celebrate a victory Porthos interposed DArtagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now	53.72979736328125
8506/28840	Men may subdue menthey cannot overcome the	114.85955047607422
8507/28840	We are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are	114.05850982666016
8508/28840	You are ungrateful DArtagnan said Athos yes ungrateful to Providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous	26.712438583374023
8509/28840	Let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to Calais or Boulog	73.20584869384766
8510/28840	Should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by	188.01141357421875
8511/28840	Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover and Calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us	83.5597915649414
8512/28840	But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north   That said Athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the	64.64643859863281
8513/28840	Which implies that we may die of hunger said Aram	56.43374252319336
8514/28840	Tis more than possible answered the Comte de la F	17.675996780395508
8515/28840	Mousqueton sighed again more deeply than	109.1768798828125
8516/28840	What is the matter what ails you asked Porth	16.894569396972656
8517/28840	Impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold	89.32146453857422
8518/28840	Ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me sh	96.14984893798828
8519/28840	How is that Mousqueton   Alas your honor in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of	37.646507263183594
8520/28840	What then   Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry	85.26740264892578
8521/28840	Yes sir answered Mousqueton but permit me to say I see nothing laughable in	34.40501403808594
8522/28840	However he added turning to Porthos I should not regret dying sir were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to	51.46147918701172
8523/28840	Mouston replied Porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the	100.37056732177734
8524/28840	And you should call it Devotion added Aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your	63.70648193359375
8525/28840	Chevalier said DArtagnan laughing you could eat a piece of Mouston couldnt you especially after two or three days of fasting   Oh no replied Aramis I should much prefer Blaisois we havent known him so	43.834083557128906
8526/28840	One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of Grimaud were not	63.795005798339844
8527/28840	Suddenly Mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted	58.99192810058594
8528/28840	Oh sir he cried passing the bottle to Porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with	92.61524963378906
8529/28840	This intelligence restored every one save Athos to gay	299.2265319824219
8530/28840	Zounds exclaimed Porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the	292.11199951171875
8531/28840	And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and	100.6891098022461
8532/28840	Now said Athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and I will	96.15283203125
8533/28840	After some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Ath	98.9389419555664
8534/28840	It was in fact a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulog	49.51067352294922
8535/28840	A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all	96.12385559082031
8536/28840	Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine oclock in the morning having a fair wind our Frenchmen set foot on their native	82.13629150390625
8537/28840	Egad how strong one feels here said Porthos almost burying his large feet in the	135.91273498535156
8538/28840	Zounds I could defy a nation   Be quiet Porthos said DArtagnan we are	45.48897933959961
8539/28840	These people who are looking at us are only merchants said Athos and are looking more at the cargo than at	109.11213684082031
8540/28840	I shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and I shall make for the Dunes as soon as	44.97016525268555
8541/28840	Sandy hills about Dunkirk from which it derives its	274.2831726074219
8542/28840	The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unob	90.72746276855469
8543/28840	Here after a short conference they proposed to	194.14683532714844
8544/28840	Because answered the Gascon we were sent Porthos and I by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell instead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles	55.33406066894531
8545/28840	not the same thing by any	50.02009201049805
8546/28840	In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur dHerblay our crime would be	16.383913040161133
8547/28840	We have circumvented Cromwell Mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Maz	64.84831237792969
8548/28840	You forget replied Athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered	138.9083709716797
8549/28840	Truly Athos interrupted DArtagnan I am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed	77.899169921875
8550/28840	Come Athos and Aramis go to the right Porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into Normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach	89.42494201660156
8551/28840	He then gave his friends minute directions as to their	295.4624938964844
8552/28840	Ah my dear friend exclaimed Athos how I should admire the resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your	60.793006896972656
8553/28840	Isnt this fox a genius Athos asked the Gas	134.32777404785156
8554/28840	No he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night thats	97.61119842529297
8555/28840	Well is all said  	110.08617401123047
8556/28840	Then lets count our money and divide	363.45819091796875
8557/28840	Ah hurrah theres the sun A merry morning to you	259.3533020019531
8558/28840	Tis a long time since I saw thee   Come come DArtagnan said Athos do not affect to be strongminded there are tears in your	28.982067108154297
8559/28840	Let us be open with each other and	118.8228988647461
8560/28840	What cried the Gascon do you think Athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and Aramis   No answered Athos embrace me my	47.38212966918945
8561/28840	Zounds said Porthos sobbing I believe Im crying but how foolish all this is   Then they	99.47776794433594
8562/28840	At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the Dunes	87.59517669677734
8563/28840	At last they lost sight of each	36.44749450683594
8564/28840	Sacrebleu DArtagnan said Porthos I must out with it at once for I cant keep to myself anything I have against you I havent been able to recognize you in this	55.25577926635742
8565/28840	Why not said DArtagnan with his wise	23.080202102661133
8566/28840	Because if as you say Athos and Aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon	48.219783782958984
8567/28840	For my part I confess to you that I was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the Mazarins in the	34.664127349853516
8568/28840	Really said Porthos opening his eyes in aston	18.412059783935547
8569/28840	If they are arrested they will only be put in the Bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the Place de Gre	47.98577880859375
8570/28840	Oh oh said Porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me DArtagn	41.11936950683594
8571/28840	Bah perhaps not so great as you think Porthos you know the proverb All roads lead to	80.9871826171875
8572/28840	But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and Aramis asked Porth	39.71064376831055
8573/28840	we very nearly succeeded in saving	155.0591278076172
8574/28840	We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin and then   The devil said Porthos what can we say to Mazarin   Leave that to meI have my	27.028095245361328
8575/28840	Cromwell is mighty Mazarin is tricky but I would rather have to do with them than with the late Monsieur Mord	48.034366607666016
8576/28840	Ah said Porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late Monsieur Mord	18.2557315826416
8577/28840	The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris followed by Mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too	62.21823501586914
8578/28840	The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint Germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves	93.85525512695312
8579/28840	This threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was	124.505615234375
8580/28840	Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack Paris by the citizens to defend	257.1811828613281
8581/28840	The latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the Prince de Conti the brother of the Prince de Condé and the Duc de Longueville his brotherin	24.368961334228516
8582/28840	This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of	79.06198120117188
8583/28840	As for the Duc de Beaufort he arrived from Vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the market	46.881866455078125
8584/28840	The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as	153.6861572265625
8585/28840	On the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious	232.50088500976562
8586/28840	They carried a banner on which could be read this strange device We are seeking our	213.15823364257812
8587/28840	The next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three	100.3956527709961
8588/28840	That was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of	121.81925201416016
8589/28840	On the first day of that month our four companions had landed at Boulogne and in two parties had set out for	54.297088623046875
8590/28840	Toward the end of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens	112.78651428222656
8591/28840	On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in	45.92222213745117
8592/28840	The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his	111.60877990722656
8593/28840	The sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said   Who are you gentlemen   Two	68.73650360107422
8594/28840	And where do you come from   From	70.87837219238281
8595/28840	And what are you going to do in Paris   We are going with a mission to Her Majesty the Queen of	20.96682357788086
8596/28840	Ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of	47.63870620727539
8597/28840	We have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her	94.22209930419922
8598/28840	Where are your passports   We have none we left England ignorant of the state of politics here having left Paris before the departure of the	62.863094329833984
8599/28840	Ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are Mazarinists who are sent as	64.19481658935547
8600/28840	My dear friend here Athos spoke rest assured if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of	154.21705627441406
8601/28840	In your situation distrust those who are well provided with every form	132.80618286132812
8602/28840	Enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the	95.18685913085938
8603/28840	The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some	426.739501953125
8604/28840	In a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded Athos and Aramis and an officer was examining their	82.61082458496094
8605/28840	The first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each	71.70049285888672
8606/28840	The first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the	89.81878662109375
8607/28840	When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to	60.07280349731445
8608/28840	Be it so said Athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible	54.3823356628418
8609/28840	There seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England and if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to	41.48448944091797
8610/28840	On hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than	68.46512603759766
8611/28840	Merciful goodness whispered Aramis to Athos did you see   What asked Ath	47.477230072021484
8612/28840	The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen  	53.32439422607422
8613/28840	At this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said   The passports are in order let these three gentlemen	72.96621704101562
8614/28840	The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this	54.02705764770508
8615/28840	Aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of Ath	48.17744827270508
8616/28840	What is the matter with you my friend asked the	24.06028938293457
8617/28840	I havedoubtless I am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out   Only by their passports they are three Frondists who are gone to rejoin the Duc de Longue	33.09787368774414
8618/28840	Tis strange said Aramis almost involuntarily I fancied that I recognized Mazarin	41.638248443603516
8619/28840	The sergeant burst into a fit of	77.51097869873047
8620/28840	He he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung Not so foolish as all	208.13746643066406
8621/28840	Ah muttered Athos I may be mistaken I havent the unerring eye of DArtagn	34.06973648071289
8622/28840	Who is speaking of Monsieur DArtagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the	23.13591194152832
8623/28840	What cried Aramis and Athos what Planchet   Planchet added Grimaud Planchet with a gorget indeed   Ah gentlemen cried Planchet so you are back again in	24.875530242919922
8624/28840	No sir I am sure he hasnt yet	75.57778930664062
8625/28840	But then he may have stopped at Saint Germ	54.77048110961914
8626/28840	I dont think so we appointed to meet at La Chev	57.32649230957031
8627/28840	And had the pretty Madeleine no news asked Aramis	80.38778686523438
8628/28840	No sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very	81.18425750732422
8629/28840	In fact said Aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey	89.55068969726562
8630/28840	Permit me then my dear Athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to	85.15918731689453
8631/28840	Ah monsieur le chevalier said Planchet b	7.467756271362305
8632/28840	Lieutenant with a promise of becoming	449.27899169921875
8633/28840	So owing to your popularity   No thanks to something	82.93074798583984
8634/28840	You know gentlemen that I served the Piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant  	43.3415412902832
8635/28840	Well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left I succeeded I did in making them all begin with the same foot and I was made lieutenant on the	136.08349609375
8636/28840	So I presume said Athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you  	37.04755783081055
8637/28840	There are the Prince de Conti the Duc de Longueville the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon the Marechal de la Mothe the Marquis de Sevigne and I dont know who for my	14.32729721069336
8638/28840	And the Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne inquired Athos in a tremulous	15.471027374267578
8639/28840	DArtagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in	38.28874206542969
8640/28840	Yes count nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant	69.4803237915039
8641/28840	Then said Athos in a tone of delight he is well no accident has happened to him   None	30.294246673583984
8642/28840	And he lives   Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlem	41.9228401184082
8643/28840	And passes his time   Sometimes with the queen of England sometimes with Madame de Chevre	73.32910919189453
8644/28840	He and the Count de Guiche are like each others	50.48635482788086
8645/28840	Thanks Planchet thanks cried Athos extending his hand to the	25.981172561645508
8646/28840	Oh sir Planchet only touched the tips of the counts	69.40595245361328
8647/28840	Well what are you doing countto a former lackey   My friend said Athos he has given me news of Ra	38.28176498413086
8648/28840	And now gentlemen said Planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do   Reenter Paris if you will let us my good Planc	33.533145904541016
8649/28840	Let you sir Now as ever I am nothing but your	124.57337188720703
8650/28840	Then turning to his men   Allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the Duc de Beau	38.084259033203125
8651/28840	Long live the Duc de Beaufort cried the sentin	22.08440589904785
8652/28840	Take notice captain he continued giving Planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these	133.5308380126953
8653/28840	And I said Planchet with dignity I know them and I answer for	52.23573684692383
8654/28840	As he said this he pressed Grimauds hand who seemed honored by the	116.79756927490234
8655/28840	Farewell till we meet again said Aramis as they took leave of Planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for	52.02509689331055
8656/28840	Sir said Planchet I am in all things at your	22.503612518310547
8657/28840	That fellow is no fool said Aramis as he got on his	66.03608703613281
8658/28840	How should he be replied Athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your	258.4781188964844
8659/28840	The two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the Lou	87.23831939697266
8660/28840	They reached the queens apartments but were compelled to stop in the antechamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from	97.95291900634766
8661/28840	We too said Athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from England but have just come from	77.2490005493164
8662/28840	What then are your names gentlemen   The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay said Aram	9.44360637664795
8663/28840	Ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a	53.46398162841797
8664/28840	Please follow me and he went on before followed by Athos and Aram	33.890724182128906
8665/28840	On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen	60.87495803833008
8666/28840	Oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the	61.23345184326172
8667/28840	The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other	110.55155944824219
8668/28840	Come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door	452.9530334472656
8669/28840	All these gentlemen had been noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low	30.318002700805664
8670/28840	Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens	41.05352020263672
8671/28840	Go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the Duc de Chat	38.629886627197266
8672/28840	You said that His Majesty King Charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects   Yes madame Chatillon stammered	44.14729309082031
8673/28840	Athos and Aramis were more and more	43.39723587036133
8674/28840	And that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant	71.83642578125
8675/28840	Just so madame replied Chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this	50.93244934082031
8676/28840	The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with	71.39249420166016
8677/28840	Now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said Chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of Ath	77.53248596191406
8678/28840	One momentI begfor here are the Chevalier dHerblay and the Comte de la Fere just arrived from London and they can give you as eyewitnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal	38.600887298583984
8679/28840	Speak gentlemen speakI am listening conceal nothing gloss over	922.1007080078125
8680/28840	Since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to	50.38395309448242
8681/28840	Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his	49.44060516357422
8682/28840	Well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his pal	79.28044891357422
8683/28840	Speak sir I beg you to do	49.425140380859375
8684/28840	I beg you to excuse me madame I wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been	47.35459518432617
8685/28840	Mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then   Sir interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the	41.67890167236328
8686/28840	I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be to accuse Her Majesty Queen Anne of	64.52291107177734
8687/28840	With the queen sir replied Athos in his calm vibrating	70.9695816040039
8688/28840	Explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every	330.7066955566406
8689/28840	On your brow I read despairyour lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidingsyour hands trem	200.49891662597656
8690/28840	Oh my God my God what has happened   Lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us   Sir said Chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the	41.47894287109375
8691/28840	Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch	113.58930206298828
8692/28840	We ought not therefore I think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier	151.71817016601562
8693/28840	Queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy	250.53237915039062
8694/28840	Athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which Charles	71.60762786865234
8695/28840	before his death had placed in the hands of Aram	30.83919906616211
8696/28840	Since the moment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted with	83.01593780517578
8697/28840	He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent	86.67862701416016
8698/28840	The queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lipsand without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her	47.889862060546875
8699/28840	Now chevalier he added turning to Aramis let us	18.752281188964844
8700/28840	said Aramis we have still a word to say to these	46.90730285644531
8701/28840	And turning to Chatillon Sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I cannot say before the	60.378562927246094
8702/28840	Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground	53.43766784667969
8703/28840	Sir said Aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary	51.085575103759766
8704/28840	That would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a	71.95892333984375
8705/28840	You know well that I dont like to leave things half	164.40455627441406
8706/28840	Conclude then sir answered De Chatillon with as much hauteur as Aram	77.99577331542969
8707/28840	Gentlemen resumed Aramis any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrestedfor we have friends in Parisbut we are contented with another	67.79205322265625
8708/28840	Come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terr	129.13827514648438
8709/28840	I know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept	44.57442855834961
8710/28840	And why not said Aramis in his tone of ra	39.082069396972656
8711/28840	Is it Mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent   Oh you hear that Flamarens said Chat	45.106529235839844
8712/28840	Not to reply would be a blot on my name and my	74.2713623046875
8713/28840	You will not reply however and these gentlemen I am sure will presently be of my	86.33028411865234
8714/28840	Aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insol	26.953937530517578
8715/28840	Chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his	79.45108795166016
8716/28840	Duke said Flamarens you forget that tomorrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the	74.0838623046875
8717/28840	Until tomorrow evening you are not at your own	59.421592712402344
8718/28840	Let it be then the day after tomorrow said Aram	50.56098937988281
8719/28840	Tomorrow rather said De Chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of Charent	35.73015213012695
8720/28840	How can you doubt it sir For the pleasure of a meeting with you I would go to the end of the	39.03281784057617
8721/28840	Are you going to rejoin your cardinal Swear first on your honor not to inform him of our	52.5662727355957
8722/28840	Conditions   Why not   Because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors	49.071590423583984
8723/28840	Then let us draw on the	47.40146255493164
8724/28840	It is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows	284.9896545410156
8725/28840	Chatillon and Flamarens looked at each	39.18514633178711
8726/28840	For what reason is all this fume and fury asked Ath	100.42356872558594
8727/28840	What have they done to you   Theydid you not see what they did  	38.555301666259766
8728/28840	They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in	210.4718475341797
8729/28840	Now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the	93.39448547363281

8733/28840	These undertakings do not suit me as you know Aram	57.574546813964844
8734/28840	Why   Because it is taking people unaw	67.5366439819336
8735/28840	Really Athos you would make a singular	110.30323791503906
8736/28840	You would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the	197.63385009765625
8737/28840	You know one cannot change his nature he	142.7956085205078
8738/28840	Besides do you know what is our situation and whether Mazarins arrest wouldnt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage   Say at once you disapprove of my	88.20645141601562
8739/28840	I think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in	60.205806732177734
8740/28840	I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite	203.78387451171875
8741/28840	Where   Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon and to tell them about	25.758956909179688
8742/28840	Yes but on one conditionthat we begin by the coadj	38.58119583129883
8743/28840	He is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him	96.79788208007812
8744/28840	It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon as his house came first but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne to see Ra	44.57101821899414
8745/28840	They reentered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois they went on foot to the Rue Gueneg	28.660608291625977
8746/28840	But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlem	10.469569206237793
8747/28840	He had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received	41.1336555480957
8748/28840	The night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of	106.5101318359375
8749/28840	On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood	45.5931396484375
8750/28840	Oh cried Aramis do you see count   Yes said Ath	18.65871238708496
8751/28840	Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be   What do you think Aramis   Why they are our	28.34069061279297
8752/28840	You are not mistaken I recognize Monsieur de Flamaren	14.391976356506348
8753/28840	As to the cavalier in the brown cloak   It is the	36.12834167480469
8754/28840	How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon   Athos smiled but did not	41.51151657104492
8755/28840	Five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes	96.25852966308594
8756/28840	This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Contis	48.567848205566406
8757/28840	He was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of	44.95703125
8758/28840	Everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to	60.52935028076172
8759/28840	Meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his	54.690155029296875
8760/28840	Ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the	58.479122161865234
8761/28840	But I as you see am nailed to my bedah this demon goutthis demon gout   My lord said Athos we are just arrived from England and our first concern is to inquire after your	58.17089080810547
8762/28840	Thanks gentlemen thanks As you see my health is but	577.37744140625
8763/28840	And King Charles is well as I have just heard   He is dead my lord said Aram	30.104631423950195
8764/28840	Pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it	62.3962287902832
8765/28840	Dead on the scaffold condemned by	120.9975357055664
8766/28840	Impossible   And executed in our	225.54022216796875
8767/28840	What then has Monsieur de Flamarens been telling me   Monsieur de Flamarens   Yes he has just gone	12.707362174987793
8768/28840	With two companions yes replied the d	144.9214630126953
8769/28840	Then he added with a certain uneasiness Did you meet them   Why yes I think soin the street said Athos and he looked smilingly at Aramis who looked at him with an expression of	29.72455596923828
8770/28840	The devil take this gout cried Monsieur de Bouillon evidently ill at	66.62440490722656
8771/28840	My lord said Athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much	68.24665069580078
8772/28840	One must replied Monsieur de Bouillon sacrifice ones comfort to the public good but I confess to you I am now almost	74.40482330322266
8773/28840	My spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout oercrows	181.83050537109375
8774/28840	Accept it my lord accept it said Aram	91.83642578125
8775/28840	I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall	53.80337905883789
8776/28840	Go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your	78.90304565429688
8777/28840	Poor King Charles But after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve	82.20596313476562
8778/28840	Oh as to that said Aramis we are	60.21418762207031
8779/28840	Mazarin especially   Yes do you know I am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly	99.06985473632812
8780/28840	Oh the devil take this gout   Athos and Aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the	33.325801849365234
8781/28840	When they reached the street Aramis said   Well Athos what do you think   Of whom   Pardieu of Monsieur de Bou	15.739078521728516
8782/28840	My friend I think that he is much troubled with g	75.52659606933594
8783/28840	You noticed that I didnt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit   You did well you would have caused him an access of his	74.51826477050781
8784/28840	Let us go to Monsieur de Beau	11.444726943969727
8785/28840	The two friends went to the Hotel de Vend	25.766542434692383
8786/28840	It was ten oclock when they	36.85063552856445
8787/28840	The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the Hotel de Bouillon and presented as warlike an	67.76790618896484
8788/28840	There were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses sadd	50.30715560913086
8789/28840	Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to	48.691497802734375
8790/28840	Ah ah gentlemen said Aramis decidedly it is a night for	94.05830383300781
8791/28840	We shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting	164.76942443847656
8792/28840	Oh as to that sir replied Chatillon for it was he who with Flamarens was leaving the Duc de Beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing	57.78026580810547
8793/28840	I hope that is true said Aram	18.20773696899414
8794/28840	As for me I am sure of it said the d	15.915681838989258
8795/28840	De Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and Aramis dis	19.196374893188477
8796/28840	Comte de la Fere the man cried out Chevalier dHerblay How does it happen that you are in Paris   Rochefort cried the two	14.875457763671875
8797/28840	Yes we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois as you know and we are going to give Mazarin something to	33.29051208496094
8798/28840	You are still with us I presume   More than	40.73447036743164
8799/28840	And the duke   Furious against the	86.74949645996094
8800/28840	You know his successour dear duke He is really king of Paris he cant go out without being mobbed by his admire	225.7837371826172
8801/28840	Ah so much the better Can we have the honor of seeing his highness   I shall be proud to present you and Rochefort walked	32.62093734741211
8802/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends	52.38688659667969
8803/28840	Ah he cried by Jove youre welcome sir	142.66786193847656
8804/28840	You are coming to sup with me are you not Boisgoli tell Noirmont that I have two	71.32036590576172
8805/28840	You know Noirmont do you not The successor of Father Marteau who makes the excellent pies you know	38.060768127441406
8806/28840	Boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for La Rame	75.85424041748047
8807/28840	Thank God we dont want either rope ladders or gagpears	578.3125610351562
8808/28840	My lord said Athos do not let us disturb	34.55500793457031
8809/28840	We came merely to inquire after your health and to take your	94.76124572753906
8810/28840	My lord said Athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordships service and his most faithful	47.45994567871094
8811/28840	My most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved	136.51763916015625
8812/28840	And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to you I hope that I remain your friend as well as that ofwhat the devil are their namesDArtagnan and Porthos   DArtagnan and Porth	25.323984146118164
8813/28840	You understand then Comte de la Fere you understand Chevalier dHerblay that I am altogether and always at your	19.995819091796875
8814/28840	Athos and Aramis bowed and went	33.51858139038086
8815/28840	Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said Aram	31.756834030151367
8816/28840	They directed their horses to the	117.56693267822266
8817/28840	On arriving at the cradle from which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a	92.43282318115234
8818/28840	The palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in Paris but in	76.21996307373047
8819/28840	Some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with	64.05755615234375
8820/28840	The friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their	108.046630859375
8821/28840	The palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the	92.43629455566406
8822/28840	Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the antechamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in	44.08848190307617
8823/28840	Good heavens said Aramis to Athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his antechamber   My dear friend we must take people as we find	52.68606185913086
8824/28840	The coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of Paris and has a	59.537109375
8825/28840	Let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of	63.67231750488281
8826/28840	Let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left	69.05928039550781
8827/28840	Ah if Im not mistaken heres Baz	187.36257934570312
8828/28840	Bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing	67.59982299804688
8829/28840	A truce to compliments said Aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in	53.59298324584961
8830/28840	Certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the antechamber only just now he has a secret conference with Monsieur de Bru	48.1773796081543
8831/28840	De Bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said Aramis so we give it	55.65153884887695
8832/28840	And they hastened to quit the palace followed by Bazin who was lavish of bows and	69.33390808105469
8833/28840	Well said Athos when Aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin   You are wisdom incarnate Athos Aramis	36.91720199584961
8834/28840	What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England which they thought should have arrested the attention of all	70.98951721191406
8835/28840	In fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre no one appeared to be aware that Charles	54.875648498535156
8836/28840	had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaff	45.105194091796875
8837/28840	The two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter	52.65284729003906
8838/28840	At ten oclock the next day they met	38.23658752441406
8839/28840	Athos had been out since six o	112.23773956298828
8840/28840	Well have you any news Athos	106.63905334472656
8841/28840	No one has seen DArtagnan and Porthos has not	21.861717224121094
8842/28840	In fact said Athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we	116.44295501708984
8843/28840	Add to that DArtagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting	44.02576446533203
8844/28840	He expected you will remember to be here on the	83.61044311523438
8845/28840	And here we are at the	97.29121398925781
8846/28840	This evening the margin of possible delay	347.095947265625
8847/28840	What do you think should be done asked Athos if we have no news of them tonight   Pardieu we must go and look for	23.813232421875
8848/28840	A light cloud passed over the counts	246.22625732421875
8849/28840	Raoul gives me much uneasiness he	126.77996063232422
8850/28840	He received yesterday a message from the Prince de Condé he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not	50.62078094482422
8851/28840	Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse   She was not at	24.93442153930664
8852/28840	And you Aramis you were going I think to visit Madame de Longue	52.171653747558594
8853/28840	Well   She was no longer there but she had left her new	47.79156494140625
8854/28840	Where was she   Guess I give you a thousand	64.36769104003906
8855/28840	How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists was at midnight for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit	57.59434509277344
8856/28840	At the Hotel de Ville my dear	44.190818786621094
8857/28840	You didnt tell me of that Aram	57.6082649230957
8858/28840	Really It was my forgetfulness then pardon	176.875244140625
8859/28840	Now asked Athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening Here we are without occupation it seems to	85.8233413696289
8860/28840	You forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of Charenton I hope to see Monsieur de Chatillon whom Ive hated for a long time	30.667530059814453
8861/28840	Why have you hated him   Because he is the brother of Colign	31.67886734008789
8862/28840	Ah true he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished that ought to satisfy	95.77896881103516
8863/28840	Yes but it does not I am rancorousthe only stigma that proves me to be a church	67.50782775878906
8864/28840	Do you understand You understand that you are in no way obliged to go with	58.16944122314453
8865/28840	Come now said Athos you are	49.5397834777832
8866/28840	I supposed said Athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike	194.5085906982422
8867/28840	No doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the	232.73648071289062
8868/28840	Come come dear Athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this	66.45655822753906
8869/28840	Well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with DArtagnan Porthos and possibly even Ra	45.24522018432617
8870/28840	Stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by Jupiter and their captainsee he has the true military	199.38137817382812

8872/28840	Question him about the fight said Ath	119.65792083740234
8873/28840	This day will be a warm one said Planchet in a warlike	50.13820266723633
8874/28840	No doubt said Aramis but it is far from here to the	42.531028747558594
8875/28840	Sir the distance will be diminished said a	193.19740295410156
8876/28840	Aramis saluted then turning toward Athos   I dont care to camp on the Place Royale with all these people he	40.658138275146484
8877/28840	Shall we go forward We shall see better what is going	112.04827880859375
8878/28840	And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for	19.239940643310547
8879/28840	Come then my friend we will go	91.70777130126953
8880/28840	Havent you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own account   My friend said Athos I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely	33.556793212890625
8881/28840	And how long ago was that   When I last drew my poni	69.08213806152344
8882/28840	Ah Good another souvenir of Monsieur Mord	56.11367416381836

8884/28840	Hush said Athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of Mordauntit will bring bad	61.89064407348633
8885/28840	And Athos set forward toward Charenton followed closely by Aram	100.56938934326172
8886/28840	As Athos and Aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of	42.89595031738281
8887/28840	There is now a truce and a	128.07656860351562
8888/28840	The prince Monsieur de Retz the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon are talking over public	26.337385177612305
8889/28840	Now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet	90.17669677734375
8890/28840	Sir said Aramis you speak to the	40.97300720214844
8891/28840	Allow me to ask you a question Where are the plenipotentiaries   At Charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of	39.1379508972168
8892/28840	And was this conference arranged beforehand   No gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Paris	74.49790954589844
8893/28840	Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made	53.8852424621582
8894/28840	And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked Athos belongs to   To Monsieur de Chanleu who commands your troops at Charent	39.18775177001953
8895/28840	I say your troops for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs   Yes almost said Aram	38.08476638793945

8897/28840	We must understand each other said the d	24.973764419555664
8898/28840	The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Condé although I must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one	85.59966278076172
8899/28840	Sir since you command the cavalry   Pardon me I am commanderinch	40.53781509399414
8900/28840	You must know all your officersI mean those more	255.90750122070312

8903/28840	I can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon the substitute for Monsieur dArtagnan still holds his	30.358009338378906
8904/28840	The two friends looked at each	28.728069305419922
8905/28840	It is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the	67.18284606933594
8906/28840	If we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must	44.90885925292969
8907/28840	Yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte   Yes sir answered Athos agitated so much so that I wish to see him if	24.282272338867188
8908/28840	Quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to	67.67871856689453
8909/28840	Halloo there cried Aramis turning around what a noise behind us   A body of cavaliers is coming toward us said Chat	90.38742065429688
8910/28840	I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist	51.42680740356445
8911/28840	And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich	54.31397247314453
8912/28840	They are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them   They are beating the rappel cried Chatillon we must discover what is going	108.50049591064453
8913/28840	In fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the Duc de Beaufort drew his	70.54090118408203
8914/28840	On his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops ran to	85.49356079101562
8915/28840	Farewell till the next time we meet cried Chatillon and he set off full gall	101.25653076171875
8916/28840	Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the Duc de Beau	25.839548110961914
8917/28840	As to the Duc de Bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to Paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the Duc dElbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a	56.1285514831543
8918/28840	Meantime between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the	87.83345031738281
8919/28840	Gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar theres the enemy	84.37545776367188
8920/28840	Let us save them half of their	308.1258544921875
8921/28840	And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the	83.76990509033203
8922/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort sent his cavalry toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sort	61.71744918823242
8923/28840	The battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of val	88.49359130859375
8924/28840	His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against	90.08738708496094
8925/28840	Chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in	83.83604431152344
8926/28840	This charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that Chanleu was almost	162.0912628173828
8927/28840	He commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally	123.23271942138672
8928/28840	Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pelemele the intrenchments with the fug	116.09964752197266
8929/28840	Aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with	92.35386657714844
8930/28840	His bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise	107.65387725830078
8931/28840	On the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in	73.28265380859375
8932/28840	The cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted	59.7371940612793
8933/28840	Ah tis you Monsieur de Chatillon cried the chevalier welcome to youI expected	39.64653015136719
8934/28840	I hope I have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here I	41.43817138671875
8935/28840	Monsieur de Chatillon cried Aramis taking from his saddlebags a second pistol I think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead	43.9377326965332
8936/28840	Thank God sir they are not   And the duke pointing his pistol at Aramis	56.097137451171875
8937/28840	But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the dukes finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching	57.62508010864258
8938/28840	Oh youve missed me cried Aramis but I swear to Heaven I will not miss	57.24314880371094
8939/28840	If I give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn	61.15058517456055
8940/28840	Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and Athos who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out Fire fire then when the shot was	40.1849365234375
8941/28840	De Chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his	23.980770111083984
8942/28840	The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuir	93.69378662109375
8943/28840	I am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the	30.65624237060547
8944/28840	I told you this I am now grieved I have kept my	49.671295166015625
8945/28840	Can I be of any use to you   Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the	39.309627532958984
8946/28840	He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming Raoul   Raoul cried Ath	41.91006851196289
8947/28840	The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the Chevalier dHerblay two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul but Aramis protected him with his	34.30633544921875
8948/28840	Athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the	61.67488098144531
8949/28840	At this crisis of the battle the prince who had been seconding De Chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the	95.52223205566406
8950/28840	On seeing him the regiment of Corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the Parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered Charenton	28.58643341064453
8951/28840	The coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by Athos Raoul and Aram	96.23062896728516
8952/28840	Aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when Athos stopped	75.10095977783203
8953/28840	On on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the Fronde	91.11180114746094
8954/28840	The three cavaliers continued their road on full gall	77.68558502197266
8955/28840	It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la F	30.382518768310547
8956/28840	What you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier   I did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir said Raoul blushing though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in	40.3050651550293
8957/28840	Thank you for the compliment my young friend replied Aramis we can see from whom you learned	91.40361785888672
8958/28840	Then you were going to Rueil   Yes I have a despatch from the prince to his em	26.426456451416016
8959/28840	You must still deliver it said Ath	71.48200988769531
8960/28840	No false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very desp	102.21924591064453
8961/28840	This young man must not however fail in his duty said Ath	69.64969635009766
8962/28840	In the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget	114.62494659423828
8963/28840	What I propose to do is fair in war the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of	180.595458984375
8964/28840	The young man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of	70.57555389404297
8965/28840	Give him the despatch Raoul you are the chevaliers	115.60028076171875
8966/28840	Raoul gave it up reluctantly Aramis instantly seized and read	223.12539672851562
8967/28840	You he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to	70.12637329101562
8968/28840	Athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about DArtagnan conquered his unwillingness to read	61.870880126953125
8969/28840	My lord I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges the ten men you	44.21030044555664
8970/28840	They are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful	160.12326049804688
8971/28840	Yes let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has yet heard from his former	70.23104858398438
8972/28840	That poor Planchet You speak of him very much at your ease Aramis he has probably been	56.171173095703125
8973/28840	All those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massac	160.15611267089844
8974/28840	On leaving Paris Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of	56.93757629394531
8975/28840	Besides they felt that the _dénouement_ of this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to	50.709312438964844
8976/28840	Besides there was no tranquillity in Paris	66.17300415039062
8977/28840	Provisions began to fail and whenever one of the Prince de Contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his	107.0661849975586
8978/28840	In one of these risings the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and library of Mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw	42.41478729248047
8979/28840	Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coupdetat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charent	35.922462463378906
8980/28840	They quitted Paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by	421.38189697265625
8981/28840	Having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to Boulogne at Abbeville and followed it step by step examining every	133.8128204345703
8982/28840	Nevertheless they were still in a state of	67.09854888916016
8983/28840	Several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at Montreuil Athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate	155.90505981445312
8984/28840	He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife  	87.8408203125
8985/28840	This is capital said Athos to Aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push	70.83863830566406
8986/28840	There the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed   Trust me said Aramis do not expect to find anything in Abbe	87.80668640136719
8987/28840	If we had only been looking for Porthos Porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced	28.939369201660156
8988/28840	But DArtagnan is devoid of such	31.057130813598633
8989/28840	Porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere	65.73934173583984
8990/28840	His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon	175.93792724609375
8991/28840	They had not looked carefully enough for their lost	254.46156311035156
8992/28840	They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their	229.8616485595703
8993/28840	Oh exclaimed Athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was DArtagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in	88.06889343261719
8994/28840	Had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken	111.01045227050781
8995/28840	You are right Aramis let us travel	41.44865417480469
8996/28840	To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be	87.9721908569336
8997/28840	Uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of Athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aram	112.7523193359375
8998/28840	They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the	57.71162033081055
8999/28840	All at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous	106.01392364501953
9000/28840	It had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant	560.259765625
9001/28840	Oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either Hercules or Porth	53.222442626953125
9002/28840	Let us get down count and examine this	417.8641052246094
9003/28840	The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it	165.19509887695312
9004/28840	With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone	105.5575180053711
9005/28840	Upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words   Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing	80.5977783203125
9006/28840	If we reach Compiegne we shall stop at the Peac	30.368906021118164
9007/28840	It is kept by a friend of	120.03474426269531
9008/28840	At last we have something definite said Athos let us go to the Peac	25.529237747192383
9009/28840	Yes answered Aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost brokenwind	47.48085403442383
9010/28840	Aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off	85.93751525878906
9011/28840	The men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported	464.11724853515625
9012/28840	In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peac	27.55354118347168
9013/28840	The host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a Chin	62.520782470703125
9014/28840	They asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rap	54.920570373535156
9015/28840	Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the	151.8331756591797
9016/28840	I see that you are the friends of these	29.27670669555664
9017/28840	Well what has happened to them   They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the	35.18287658691406
9018/28840	Eight said Aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and DArtagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight	44.09703063964844
9019/28840	The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by	111.73636627197266
9020/28840	Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said Aram	80.9443359375
9021/28840	Toward the town of Louvres was the	122.3670883178711
9022/28840	The two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to Louv	63.07952880859375
9023/28840	Here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that	95.56105041503906
9024/28840	DArtagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of	52.54999542236328
9025/28840	They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counteras their friends must have done before	90.1292724609375
9026/28840	The counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin Rue	109.09002685546875
9027/28840	Let us go to Rueil said Ath	41.777183532714844
9028/28840	It is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said Aram	82.22321319580078
9029/28840	Had I been as great a friend of Jonah as I am of DArtagnan I should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself and you would have done the same Aram	52.09788131713867
9030/28840	Certainlybut you make me out better than I am dear	96.37059020996094
9031/28840	Had I been alone I should scarcely have gone to Rueil without great	145.25811767578125
9032/28840	Here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was	78.19783782958984
9033/28840	The two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented	33.60749816894531
9034/28840	They expected to hear some mention made of DArtagnan or of Porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and	54.7700080871582
9035/28840	It was the advice of Athos to go straight to the	43.067779541015625
9036/28840	My friend said Aramis take care our safety lies in our	145.16969299316406
9037/28840	If we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us	73.15741729736328

9080/28840	The greatest possible gayety prevailed at	292.2428283691406

9125/28840	He waited then in the antechamber with impatience till he should be conducted to	39.11897659301758
9126/28840	He walked to the window and looked into the	46.49845886230469

9140/28840	To the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive	53.74348449707031

9167/28840	Must we then asked Anne of Austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times   Mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal	108.44768524169922

9197/28840	In military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome	117.03746795654297
9198/28840	In the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach and reached the Seine at Chat	44.662296295166016
9199/28840	The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queens generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at	157.14703369140625
9200/28840	Athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by Comminges followed the cardinal in	107.08451080322266
9201/28840	Grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near Aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had	71.01541900634766
9202/28840	Grimaud had indeed during twentytwo years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than Athoss imminent death was likely to make him	112.7435531616211
9203/28840	At the branching off of the road toward Paris Aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned	73.4131088256836
9204/28840	Mazarin went to the right hand and Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the	112.17497253417969
9205/28840	Athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back	140.65505981445312
9206/28840	The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow Athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his	61.013370513916016
9207/28840	Ten minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at Rueil as he alighted Comminges approached	41.383480072021484
9208/28840	My lord he asked where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la Fere to be lodged   In the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard	28.644411087036133
9209/28840	I wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the	60.22297668457031
9210/28840	My lord answered Comminges he begs to be taken to the place where Monsieur dArtagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orang	31.80531883239746
9211/28840	Tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in the Fr	158.68048095703125
9212/28840	If we put these three men together Monsieur Comminges said Mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodig	49.576881408691406
9213/28840	Comminges smiled Mazarin read and construed that	462.6141357421875
9214/28840	You do not know these men Monsieur Comminges but I know them first personally also by hears	63.276248931884766
9215/28840	I sent them to carry aid to King Charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among	101.75030517578125
9216/28840	But since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison   In prison said Mazarin and when has Rueil been a prison   Ever since there were prisoners in it answered Comm	82.7976303100586
9217/28840	These gentlemen Comminges are not prisoners returned Mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my	110.98023223876953
9218/28840	Well while taking my walk I will call on him and we will	119.47222137451172
9219/28840	Although he professes to be my enemy I have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange	84.27360534667969
9220/28840	Comminges bowed and returned to Athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the	53.66459655761719
9221/28840	Sir replied Comminges it seems that it is	22.86760902404785
9222/28840	Monsieur de Comminges said Athos I have been a soldier all my life and I know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render	49.675724029541016
9223/28840	I am entirely at your service except only for my	59.672767639160156
9224/28840	Thank you sir what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any	61.08702087402344
9225/28840	If it should even compromise me a little said Monsieur de Comminges with a smile still make your	47.21705627441406
9226/28840	I dont like Mazarin any better than you	72.59519958496094
9227/28840	I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but I serve the one with joy and the other against my	77.91444396972656
9228/28840	Speak then I beg of you I wait and	154.62033081054688
9229/28840	Since there is no harm said Athos in my knowing that DArtagnan is here I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am	37.441619873046875
9230/28840	I have received no orders on that	75.8604965209961
9231/28840	Well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that I am his	71.14530181884766
9232/28840	Which cannot last interrupted Comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison	115.3553466796875
9233/28840	But there are oubliettes replied Athos	56.7900390625
9234/28840	Oh thats a different thing yes I know there are traditions of that sort said Comm	85.37577819824219
9235/28840	It was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our Mazarinimpossible an Italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as	52.98833465576172
9236/28840	Oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such as he is would not have recourse to	72.2809066772461
9237/28840	Your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of France would demand an explanation of your	72.54363250732422
9238/28840	No no be easy on that	78.45872497558594
9239/28840	I will however inform Monsieur dArtagnan of your arrival	26.870338439941406
9240/28840	Comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orang	23.126689910888672
9241/28840	They passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and court	93.53938293457031
9242/28840	From the ends of these two wings extended the	196.6588134765625
9243/28840	Athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by Comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where DArtagnan was	63.69069290161133
9244/28840	For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears and I chose the latter at any rate it is a French	78.13040924072266
9245/28840	Poor DArtagnan said Athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he	50.9306640625
9246/28840	You have two unruly prisoners there	467.3030090332031
9247/28840	Unruly Comminges smiled you wish to terrify me I	190.2054901123047
9248/28840	When he came here Monsieur DArtagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order I suppose to have his sword	64.7449951171875
9249/28840	That mood lasted some time but now hes as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon songs which make one die of	279.2310485839844
9250/28840	Ah hes quite another sort of persona formidable gentleman	505.7506408691406
9251/28840	The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left	69.43110656738281
9252/28840	But his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about	106.05032348632812
9253/28840	Do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked Comminges who putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the Comte de la Fere had said began to feel a degree of uneas	41.81473159790039
9254/28840	Athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by DArtagn	92.303466796875
9255/28840	Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied They They are two hotheadsthe one a Gascon the other from Picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down	230.52099609375
9256/28840	You have had a proof of that in what you have just related to	34.9334602355957
9257/28840	This too was the opinion of Comminges who withdrew somewhat	105.69673156738281
9258/28840	Athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a noble	87.44881439208984
9259/28840	He awaited Mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present	182.8655548095703
9260/28840	Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting	58.027931213378906
9261/28840	At the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of Ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of	111.74825286865234
9262/28840	It was in this pavilion on the ground floor that DArtagnan and Porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different	48.05720138549805
9263/28840	DArtagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servants	58.52107620239258
9264/28840	Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just	75.4725570678711
9265/28840	The one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was med	103.4359130859375
9266/28840	The other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half	64.95805358886719
9267/28840	But his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes sn	68.12479400634766
9268/28840	We have been in this place nearly eightythree	59.58218002319336

9270/28840	Did you hear eternal sleeper cried DArtagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the	53.633644104003906
9271/28840	I say we have been here eightythree	57.98027801513672
9272/28840	How my fault   Yes I offered you	117.91963195800781
9273/28840	By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door  	136.10763549804688
9274/28840	Porthos men like us cant go out from here purely and	151.4513702392578
9275/28840	Faith said Porthos as for me I could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too	44.7958984375
9276/28840	And besides he said going out of this chamber isnt	125.94219970703125
9277/28840	Dear friend said Porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than you were	66.75035858154297
9278/28840	Explain to me why going out of this chamber isnt	200.2869873046875
9279/28840	Because having neither arms nor password we shouldnt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sent	94.84058380126953
9280/28840	Very well said Porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his	32.39326477050781
9281/28840	Lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this	186.8321075439453
9282/28840	Ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time I did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study Rue	48.652610778808594
9283/28840	What difference does that make said Porth	77.73101806640625
9284/28840	We shall go out all the	55.25298309326172
9285/28840	Do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands   No said Porthos but I should be glad to be	32.644107818603516
9286/28840	It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly	158.58131408691406
9287/28840	What then   Why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed	48.496395111083984
9288/28840	And what have master pastrycooks to do with us   We ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at	68.71687316894531
9289/28840	In England lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our	223.08380126953125
9290/28840	By whom then were we beaten asked Porth	106.24559783935547
9291/28840	Yes but we have drowned Monsieur Mord	29.120872497558594
9292/28840	That is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at	69.90409088134766
9293/28840	But listen Porthos though Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised Mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning	44.47693634033203
9294/28840	We must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know	110.66194915771484
9295/28840	That is true said Porthos echoing DArtagnans	17.533178329467773
9296/28840	Well Porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good	139.1726531982422
9297/28840	But dont sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like	485.020751953125
9298/28840	As to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first	122.1378173828125
9299/28840	How well you reason said Porthos admiring	95.39938354492188
9300/28840	Well yes pretty well replied DArtagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us	73.33480834960938
9301/28840	Well it is impossible but that Master Aramis that keenscented bloodhound and Athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our	85.4359359741211
9302/28840	Then believe me it will be time to	50.03981018066406
9303/28840	We can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at	72.23897552490234
9304/28840	What is that   Did you observe DArtagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton   No but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it so never	39.351802825927734
9305/28840	And then I feel the loss of my house tis a long time since I visited my	60.00271987915039
9306/28840	Forget them for a time we shall return to them unless Mazarin razes them to the	60.868770599365234
9307/28840	Do you think that likely   No the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk	88.7278060913086
9308/28840	Well then assume a cheerful manner as I do we must joke with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we cant corrupt	104.20005798339844
9309/28840	Try Porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our	48.52650451660156
9310/28840	Thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is Porthos the less attractive it	106.21089935302734
9311/28840	Ah I would give much to have five hundred louis	55.69563293457031
9312/28840	So would I said Porthos unwilling to be behind DArtagnan in generosity I would give as much as a hundred pist	35.24607467651367
9313/28840	The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when Comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and	79.81424713134766
9314/28840	I declare said Porthos I shall eat nothing if they do not take it	31.4505558013916
9315/28840	Remove the mutton cried Comminges I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup well more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his	53.471351623535156
9316/28840	No I am sorry to tell you he is perfectly	27.202438354492188
9317/28840	News in prison is a fruit so rare that I trust Monsieur de Comminges you will excuse my impatiencethe more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is	63.23721694946289

9321/28840	A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos If Athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long Athos will	144.73976135253906
9322/28840	Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea he	55.185264587402344
9323/28840	Do you say asked the Gascon timidly that the Comte de la Fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and myself   Yes	13.912381172180176
9324/28840	Then you have seen him   Certainly I	20.872404098510742

9327/28840	He is wandering about the environs of the castle thought DArtagn	34.07676315307617

9331/28840	Suppose there were a window in this	131.73648071289062
9332/28840	Well   From that window you would see Monsieur de la Fere at	21.566635131835938
9333/28840	The count then is in the chateau  	26.67464828491211
9334/28840	For what reason   The same as	70.69037628173828
9335/28840	Athosa prisoner   You know well replied De Comminges that there are no prisoners at Rueil because there is no	61.869667053222656
9336/28840	Dont let us play upon words	182.2852325439453

9338/28840	The arms of DArtagnan fell powerless by his	36.65167999267578
9339/28840	One might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared	119.5844497680664
9340/28840	Suddenly DArtagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than	38.6855583190918
9341/28840	Come come said Comminges who since DArtagnan on the day of Broussels arrest had saved him from the hands of the Parisians had entertained a real affection for him dont be unhappy I never thought of bringing you bad	51.36318588256836

9343/28840	But DArtagnan was still in a desponding	17.160371780395508
9344/28840	And how did he look asked Porthos who perceiving that DArtagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or	40.607601165771484
9345/28840	A great favor Zounds Monsieur the Comte de la Fere whose family is allied to the Montmorency and the Rohan is easily the equal of Monsieur de Maz	22.008312225341797

9347/28840	On reflection my dear Du Vallon it is a great honor for the Comte de la Fere and gives good reason to	22.388437271118164

9349/28840	What I am mistaken   Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit	10.313079833984375
9350/28840	No no no said Comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were I clearly understood what the cardinal said to	85.18128967285156
9351/28840	He will come and visit the Comte de la F	13.717899322509766
9352/28840	DArtagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether Porthos understood the importance of that visit but Porthos did not even look toward	27.611417770385742
9353/28840	It is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked DArtagn	43.138710021972656
9354/28840	Every evening he shuts himself in	402.0052795410156
9355/28840	That it seems is where he meditates on state	247.4894256591797
9356/28840	In that case said DArtagnan I begin to believe that Monsieur de la Fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an	21.242345809936523
9357/28840	And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers   The soldiers are Swiss who understand only	233.9624481201172
9358/28840	Besides according to all probability they will wait at the	49.500675201416016
9359/28840	DArtagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too	33.881595611572266
9360/28840	Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la Fere said DArtagnan for the count must be	18.474323272705078
9361/28840	Oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi The count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his	82.65049743652344
9362/28840	Two soldiers said DArtagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my	128.8199462890625
9363/28840	That is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for Bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes	50.170654296875
9364/28840	Finelooking men upon my word said DArtagn	38.33281326293945
9365/28840	They belong to the regiment that was at Lens which the prince assigned to the	72.92024230957031
9366/28840	Ah monsieur said DArtagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur de la Fere our	29.75506591796875
9367/28840	I wish it with all my heart said Comm	31.619461059570312
9368/28840	Then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it   Not at	44.06196212768555
9369/28840	This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascons	95.905517578125
9370/28840	Now said DArtagnan Ive one last favor to ask of you Monsieur de Comm	22.76205062866211
9371/28840	You will see the count again   Tomorrow	51.667171478271484
9372/28840	Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained   You want the cardinal to come here   No I know my place and am not so presumpt	61.70150375366211
9373/28840	Let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all I	38.20777893066406
9374/28840	Oh muttered Porthos shaking his head never should I have thought this of him How misfortune humbles a man   I promise you it shall be done answered De Comm	56.866241455078125
9375/28840	Tell the count that I am well that you found me sad but	161.6788330078125
9376/28840	I am pleased sir to hear	68.23184204101562
9377/28840	And the same also for Monsieur du Vallon   Not for me cried Porthos I am not by any means	26.94194221496582
9378/28840	But you will be resigned my	91.13752746582031
9379/28840	Never   He will become so monsieur I know him better than he knows	30.97098731994629
9380/28840	Be silent dear Du Vallon and resign	120.16239166259766
9381/28840	Adieu gentlemen said De Comminges sleep well   We will	85.44681549072266
9382/28840	De Comminges went away DArtagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be	32.16395568847656
9383/28840	Oh cried Porthos whats the matter now Have you gone mad my dear friend   What is the matter returned DArtagnan we are saved   I dont see that at all answered Porth	20.81475067138672
9384/28840	I think we are all taken prisoners except Aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarins mouset	109.36727905273438
9385/28840	Which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned DArtagn	65.34262084960938
9386/28840	Never mind lets sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the	135.84898376464844
9387/28840	What are we to do then tonight   To travel	46.147891998291016
9388/28840	But   Sit down dear friend to	86.60755920410156
9389/28840	When one is eating ideas flow	2655.757568359375
9390/28840	After supper when they are perfected I will communicate my plans to	81.09758758544922
9391/28840	So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by DArtagnans inventive	54.15675735473633
9392/28840	Supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of DArtagn	46.697479248046875
9393/28840	Not a scintilla of these was lost on Porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his	52.34131622314453
9394/28840	At dessert DArtagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his	54.64500427246094
9395/28840	Porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at DArtagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfell	26.728038787841797
9396/28840	You were saying my dear friend   No I said	24.898832321166992
9397/28840	Yes you were saying you wished to leave this	59.18115234375
9398/28840	Ah indeed the will was never	197.67295837402344
9399/28840	To get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a	210.11988830566406
9400/28840	Tis trueI said so and I say it	116.63768005371094
9401/28840	And I answered you Porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldnt go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend	56.74729919433594
9402/28840	That is true we should need clothes and	479.90484619140625
9403/28840	Well said DArtagnan rising we have them friend Porthos and even something	42.0904541015625
9404/28840	Useless to look everything will come to us when	441.0196533203125
9405/28840	At about what time did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday   An hour after	106.7778091430664
9406/28840	If they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour   In a quarter of an hour at	43.59595489501953
9407/28840	Your arm is still strong enough is it not Porthos   Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary	40.00303268432617
9408/28840	Yes indeed said he I believe	41.87356185913086
9409/28840	So that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew  	53.260711669921875
9410/28840	And the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his	145.86489868164062
9411/28840	I used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at Pierrefonds and I have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my	66.94326782226562
9412/28840	Because your strength is not in your head Porthos said his	67.2181625366211
9413/28840	No it is in my arms and shoulders answered Porthos with gratified naive	38.12165832519531
9414/28840	Well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron	105.46826171875
9415/28840	Porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been	51.86951446533203
9416/28840	Well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done	99.1236801147461
9417/28840	Shall I take out any more of them asked Porth	65.82258605957031
9418/28840	No that is sufficient a man can pass through	79.98348999023438
9419/28840	Porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body	60.70931625366211
9420/28840	Now pass your arm through this	177.72344970703125
9421/28840	Why   You will know presentlypass	26.421737670898438
9422/28840	Porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the	38.32004928588867
9423/28840	Good What shall I do now  	40.60231018066406
9424/28840	It is finished then   No not	62.450523376464844
9425/28840	I should like to understand said Porth	16.093894958496094
9426/28840	Listen my dear friend in two words you will know	101.36653137207031
9427/28840	The door of the guardhouse opens as you	74.0308609008789
9428/28840	They are about to send into our court which Monsieur de Mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend	41.970272064208984
9429/28840	If only they close the guardhouse door Good They close	687.3876953125
9430/28840	What then   Silence They may hear	91.57981872558594
9431/28840	And yet I should have preferred   You will have the pleasure of the	45.524513244628906
9432/28840	Hush   Porthos remained silent and motion	18.585254669189453
9433/28840	In fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of	94.0089340209961
9434/28840	At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned	41.40207290649414
9435/28840	Now said DArtagnan I am going to call this soldier and talk to	31.481449127197266
9436/28840	Dont lose a word of what Im going to say to you Porth	35.28097152709961
9437/28840	Good the execution of plots is my for	848.5110473632812
9438/28840	Look I shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to	64.9084243774414
9439/28840	But supposing he doesnt mount   He will rely upon	61.142974853515625
9440/28840	As soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the	79.29849243164062
9441/28840	Then raising him up as Tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he cant cry	154.0062255859375
9442/28840	Suppose I happen to strangle him   To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world but you will not do so I	49.428043365478516
9443/28840	Lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomew	340.45037841796875
9444/28840	So we shall get from him one uniform and a	97.79098510742188
9445/28840	Marvelous exclaimed Porthos looking at the Gascon with the most profound	29.884580612182617
9446/28840	Yes said Porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for	54.21016311645508
9447/28840	Therefore when I cough stretch out your	148.39263916015625
9448/28840	Good   The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed Porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the	39.63774108886719
9449/28840	Goodevening comrade said DArtagnan in his most fascinating voice and	39.42289352416992
9450/28840	Goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial	132.09432983398438
9451/28840	Tis not too warm to walk resumed DArtagn	46.46327209472656
9452/28840	And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you   A glass of wine will be extremely	36.053489685058594
9453/28840	The fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the Gascon to Porth	87.76679992675781
9454/28840	A bottle perhaps   A whole bottle Yes	255.01095581054688
9455/28840	A whole bottle if you will drink my	182.4872589111328
9456/28840	Come then and take it friend said the Gas	63.62569808959961
9457/28840	How convenient that theres a bench	243.43724060058594
9458/28840	Egad one would think it had been placed here on	123.7157974243164
9459/28840	That instant the arm of Porthos	47.2114372253418
9460/28840	His hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincers the soldiers	137.3429412841797
9461/28840	He raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the	70.02923583984375
9462/28840	Then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two	91.39041137695312
9463/28840	Heres a sword and a dress said Porth	50.42156982421875
9464/28840	I take them said DArtagnan for	18.948129653930664
9465/28840	If you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over	165.7361297607422
9466/28840	Stop I see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward	126.41908264160156
9467/28840	I think replied Porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruin	46.75339889526367
9468/28840	No I will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready g	94.72370910644531
9469/28840	Be ready said Porthos as he slipped through the	36.334205627441406
9470/28840	Porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after	80.9800033569336
9471/28840	Then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of	90.58084106445312
9472/28840	This operation proved as great a success as the	338.6412048339844
9473/28840	There said DArtagnan this is capital Now let me try on the dress of yonder	42.56291961669922
9474/28840	Porthos I doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red	59.36514663696289
9475/28840	It happened however that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted Porthos	151.09152221679688
9476/28840	Tis done they both exclaimed at	294.1343994140625
9477/28840	As to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead	103.09251403808594
9478/28840	The soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of Porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against	79.06246948242188
9479/28840	Now said DArtagnan you wouldnt be sorry to understand the plot would you Porthos   Well no not	35.497772216796875
9480/28840	Well then we shall go down into the	44.500980377197266
9481/28840	We shall take the place of those two	60.401512145996094
9482/28840	Well   We will walk back and	123.21543884277344
9483/28840	Thats a good idea for it isnt	131.62747192382812
9484/28840	In a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day	34.06252670288086
9485/28840	And we shall answer   No on the contrary we shall not	34.76378631591797
9486/28840	As you please I dont insist on	154.66554260253906
9487/28840	We will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his em	84.28473663330078
9488/28840	Where shall we escort him   Where he is goingto visit Ath	65.59496307373047
9489/28840	Do you think Athos will be sorry to see us   Oh cried Porthos oh I	29.378623962402344
9490/28840	Wait a little Porthos before crying out for on my word you havent reached the end said the Gascon in a jesting	54.69338607788086
9491/28840	The man who lives to see shall	277.9842529296875
9492/28840	And slipping through the aperture he alighted in the	46.056236267089844
9493/28840	Porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less	53.4887580871582
9494/28840	They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the	129.24021911621094
9495/28840	Where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the	40.77934265136719
9496/28840	What say you to that Monsieur du Vallon he added in a low tone to Porth	11.190191268920898
9497/28840	If it but lasts most capital responded Porth	148.80856323242188
9498/28840	Do you hearnot a single creature Obey that person	267.6395568847656
9499/28840	On your return you cannot make a	112.91404724121094
9500/28840	You have only to wait here till I release	76.68743133544922
9501/28840	DArtagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than Bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the Gascon a dozen times to the	21.197181701660156
9502/28840	The Gascon therefore instead of answering growled out Ja Ja in the most German and the least Gascon accent	95.4506607055664
9503/28840	As for Porthos on whom DArtagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos he was simply	38.25930404663086
9504/28840	All that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial Der Teufel   Bernouin shut the door and went	52.01395797729492
9505/28840	When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for	94.29491424560547
9506/28840	Porthos my friend said DArtagnan dont distrust Providence Let me meditate and	48.107479095458984
9507/28840	Meditate and consider as much as you like replied Porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this	94.6104965209961
9508/28840	We have walked eight paces whispered DArtagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orang	65.35533905029297
9509/28840	The Comte de la Fere cannot be far off only the doors are	54.55582046508789
9510/28840	That is a slight difficulty said Porthos and a good push with the shoulders   For Gods sake Porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they	62.41628646850586
9511/28840	Have you not heard that some one is coming here  	50.31293487548828
9512/28840	Well that some one will open the	114.25337982177734
9513/28840	But my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you dont propose I imagine that I shall kill that man of the	102.30150604248047
9514/28840	That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or	161.41845703125
9515/28840	Oh may God keep me from it and you too said DArtagn	26.387479782104492
9516/28840	The young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to	93.30155181884766
9517/28840	And then besides the useless blood never no never I have my plan let me carry it out and we shall	188.74269104003906
9518/28840	So much the better said Porthos I feel some need of	29.07733917236328
9519/28840	Hush said DArtagnan the some one is	55.055477142333984
9520/28840	The sound of a light step was heard in the vestib	46.32115173339844
9521/28840	The hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his	45.74201202392578
9522/28840	Porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern   Light the lamp which hangs from the	57.29823303222656
9523/28840	Then addressing DArtagnan   You know the watchword he	21.481239318847656
9524/28840	Ja replied the Gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German	73.39344024658203
9525/28840	And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he	53.74928665161133
9526/28840	Now asked Porthos what are we to do   Now we shall make use of your shoulder friend Porthos if this door proves to be	42.362308502197266
9527/28840	Everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait	109.6069564819336
9528/28840	But first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder caval	145.91664123535156
9529/28840	The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open	111.48766326904297
9530/28840	There said DArtagnan we cant be overt	17.350444793701172
9531/28840	The bolt gave way and the door	138.80819702148438
9532/28840	As I told you everything can be attained Porthos women and doors by proceeding with gent	107.77668762207031
9533/28840	Youre a great moralist and thats the fact said Porth	95.42967987060547
9534/28840	Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it	76.17901611328125
9535/28840	DArtagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding	42.28506088256836
9536/28840	He called Porthos to look at	32.64393615722656
9537/28840	Were our object money only he said we should be rich	353.0718688964844
9538/28840	It would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said Porth	36.86759567260742
9539/28840	So I think and therefore I said Were our object money only but we want something else replied the Gas	113.2280044555664
9540/28840	At the same moment whilst DArtagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the	53.24494552612305
9541/28840	Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong	117.32864379882812
9542/28840	Faith he said in Italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith theres enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in	135.80520629882812
9543/28840	I am a great captainthat I am but I make war in my own	48.58480453491211
9544/28840	The two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side	139.58189392089844
9545/28840	Mazarin came within three steps of DArtagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its	134.8284454345703
9546/28840	Then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern Now he said for Monsieur de la F	34.53003692626953
9547/28840	Very good thought DArtagnan tis our road likewise we will go	60.643436431884766
9548/28840	All three set off on their walk Mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side	189.04757690429688
9549/28840	The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of	89.64066314697266
9550/28840	He then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in	44.77130126953125
9551/28840	Ah Diavolo he exclaimed I forgot the recommendation of De Comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that fourheaded combination of	50.48329544067383
9552/28840	And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his	50.59995651245117
9553/28840	Do not give yourself the trouble my lord said DArtagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we	53.50700759887695
9554/28840	And he made the same friendly salute as DArtagn	50.869285583496094
9555/28840	Mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of	121.58492279052734
9556/28840	DArtagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been	52.03169631958008
9557/28840	Oh what imprudence my lord said DArtagnan tis not good to be about just here without a	34.02109909057617
9558/28840	Your eminence might knock against something or fall into a	114.49181365966797
9559/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan muttered Mazarin unable to recover from his aston	26.656648635864258
9560/28840	I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du Vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself	28.26668357849121
9561/28840	And DArtagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole	42.06148147583008
9562/28840	You were going to visit Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagn	7.012538909912109
9563/28840	Be so good as to show us the way and we will follow	39.25320053100586
9564/28840	Mazarin was by degrees recovering his	831.1044311523438
9565/28840	Have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his	83.41033935546875
9566/28840	Porthos opened his mouth to reply DArtagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually	45.536460876464844
9567/28840	This moment come my lord said DArtagn	23.098901748657227
9568/28840	His fears were now no longer for his hoard but for	129.25144958496094
9569/28840	A sort of smile played on his	126.93487548828125
9570/28840	Come he said you have me in a snare	62.59747314453125
9571/28840	You wish to ask for liberty andI give it	75.44937896728516
9572/28840	Oh my lord answered DArtagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of	31.00356674194336
9573/28840	You have your liberty repeated Mazarin in	191.74940490722656
9574/28840	Certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back	42.507843017578125
9575/28840	Mazarin felt a shiver run through hima chill even to his hearts	447.973876953125
9576/28840	His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon and the unchanging countenance of Porth	48.907501220703125
9577/28840	Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read	61.716949462890625
9578/28840	To purchase back my liberty said the	205.7227783203125
9579/28840	And how much will that cost me Monsieur dArtagnan   Zounds my lord I dont know	16.40468406677246
9580/28840	We must ask the Comte de la Fere the	20.668188095092773
9581/28840	Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the counts room and in ten minutes all will be	44.210060119628906
9582/28840	Be assured answered Mazarin that I shall attempt nothing I give you my word of	81.23936462402344
9583/28840	DArtagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to Mazarin   Now my lord let us enter if you	15.10142993927002
9584/28840	Mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice Comminges had given	120.47450256347656
9585/28840	Your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of	46.40852737426758
9586/28840	And so my dear count said DArtagnan his eminence didnt actually insist on our attending him it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see	50.488243103027344
9587/28840	At that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone Athos made a bound of	250.8611297607422
9588/28840	Ah my lord cried the Gascon dont threaten tis a bad	76.4453353881836
9589/28840	We are so good and gentle to your em	52.81241989135742
9590/28840	Come let us put aside all rancor and talk	101.51904296875
9591/28840	Theres nothing I wish more replied Maz	279.5899658203125
9592/28840	But dont think yourselves in a better position than you	100.9089584350586
9593/28840	In ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap	158.04074096679688
9594/28840	How are you to get away from here remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these	123.81105041503906
9595/28840	Now I am going to show you how sincere I	47.78452682495117
9596/28840	Good thought DArtagnan we must look about us hes going to play us a	79.6395263671875
9597/28840	I offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it Before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like	142.78416442871094
9598/28840	And like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his	219.621337890625
9599/28840	And therefore said DArtagnan to clip the hope which Athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to Mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extrem	49.85034942626953
9600/28840	If on the contrary resumed Mazarin you accept your liberty   Why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it away from	40.83796310424805
9601/28840	You do not believe me   My lord I never believe cardinals who are not	55.99000549316406
9602/28840	Well on the faith of a	145.1322479248047
9603/28840	You are no longer a minister my lord you are a	35.91681671142578
9604/28840	Then on the honor of a Mazarin as I am and ever shall be I hope said the	49.233089447021484
9605/28840	I have heard speak of a Mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in	85.8777847290039
9606/28840	I fear he may have been an ancestor of your em	43.56920623779297
9607/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan you are a great wit and I am really sorry to be on bad terms with	16.34636688232422
9608/28840	My lord let us come to terms I ask nothing	149.8872528076172
9609/28840	Very well said Mazarin if I place you in security in a manner evident palpable   Ah that is another thing said Porth	37.52077102661133
9610/28840	In the first place do you accept asked the	63.19085693359375
9611/28840	Unfold your plan my lord and we will	112.56005859375
9612/28840	Take notice that you are shut upcapt	63.89141845703125
9613/28840	You well know my lord that there always remains to us a last	49.58103942871094
9614/28840	What   That of dying	150.8830108642578
9615/28840	Listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which I have the key it leads into the	68.49565887451172
9616/28840	Go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have	161.9766845703125
9617/28840	At a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and	55.62760925292969
9618/28840	Ah by Jove my lord said DArtagnan you have well said but these are only	42.54878616333008
9619/28840	Where is the key you speak of   Here it	28.467544555664062
9620/28840	Ah my lord You will conduct us yourself then to that door   Very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and Mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the	68.3517074584961
9621/28840	It led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their	53.96419906616211
9622/28840	The devil exclaimed the Gascon tis a dreadful night my	55.62007522583008
9623/28840	We dont know the locality and shall never find the	71.85578155517578
9624/28840	Since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the	111.99053955078125
9625/28840	Be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same	41.19315719604492
9626/28840	I think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were	39.8787727355957
9627/28840	Deuce take it three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church Ah apropos my lord you remarked that we were all active vigorous and	92.32199096679688
9628/28840	Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are	39.91242599487305
9629/28840	The count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend	82.57608795166016
9630/28840	Where can we find another sword asked Porth	46.01377868652344
9631/28840	My lord said DArtagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the Comte de la F	27.345571517944336
9632/28840	Willingly said the cardinal I will even ask the count to keep it for my	63.45018768310547
9633/28840	I promise you my lord never to part with it replied Ath	48.28793716430664
9634/28840	Well well cried DArtagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes Porthos   Yes said Porthos but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep I think it is the	36.30189895629883
9635/28840	Now climb up Athos quickly said DArtagn	28.120229721069336
9636/28840	Athos assisted by Porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the	59.00405502319336
9637/28840	Athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the	53.76982116699219
9638/28840	Are you on the ground asked DArtagn	10.960250854492188
9639/28840	Without accident   Perfectly safe and	98.52667236328125
9640/28840	Porthos whilst I get up watch the	110.01486206054688
9641/28840	No I dont want your help watch the	185.50088500976562
9642/28840	Well   You are right it is more difficult than I	21.00251579284668
9643/28840	Lend me your backbut dont let the cardinal	340.197998046875
9644/28840	Porthos lent him his back and DArtagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated	20.598539352416992
9645/28840	Yes my friend and now   Now what asked Porth	31.56999969482422
9646/28840	Now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle	148.84596252441406
9647/28840	You are free he said through me your liberty was my	234.81881713867188
9648/28840	Porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the	107.63874053955078
9649/28840	I didnt understand it all he said but I understand now how droll it is   You think so so much the better but that it may prove laughterworthy even to the end let us not lose	38.588470458984375
9650/28840	Attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said DArtagnan for myself I will reconnoit	40.55372619628906
9651/28840	The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant	128.4437713623047
9652/28840	My lord he said which way do we go Think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of	206.9971466064453
9653/28840	Along the wall sir said Mazarin there will be no danger of losing	84.0962142944336
9654/28840	The three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the	81.61194610595703
9655/28840	The cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do	98.12991333007812
9656/28840	Suddenly DArtagnan touched something warm which	85.05944061279297
9657/28840	Stop a horse he cried I have found a horse   And I likewise said Ath	58.79282760620117
9658/28840	I too said Porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals	59.17864227294922
9659/28840	Theres luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to	115.1173095703125
9660/28840	Is Aramis here   Yes sir he has been here since	34.11073303222656
9661/28840	What are you doing   On the watch   What Aramis here cried Ath	24.615869522094727
9662/28840	At the lesser gate of the castle hes posted	275.5656433105469
9663/28840	Are you a large party   S	47.75318145751953
9664/28840	And believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself Grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his	105.4291000366211
9665/28840	There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Maz	55.66916275024414
9666/28840	Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron and DArtagnan a	89.22330474853516
9667/28840	At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten	69.31906127929688
9668/28840	He was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends	93.74004364013672
9669/28840	You are free my brothers free without my aid and I shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my	72.74825286865234
9670/28840	Do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied Ath	75.64009094238281
9671/28840	I had well concerted my plans pursued Aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from Rueil to Saint Germain twenty are dispersed in the	98.21698760986328
9672/28840	Thus I was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from Mazarin to the	84.23527526855469
9673/28840	In the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to Melun since Rueil seemed to him not sufficiently	133.51560974121094
9674/28840	You can understand dear friend with what hope I was inspired by that last	167.66632080078125
9675/28840	I placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men I encircled the castle the riding horses I entrusted to Grimaud and I awaited your coming out which I did not expect till tomorrow and I didnt hope to free you without a skirm	73.00617218017578
9676/28840	You are free tonight without fighting so much the better How did you manage to escape that scoundrel Mazarin You must have much reason to complain of	48.494869232177734
9677/28840	Really   I might even say that we have some reason to praise	38.687965393066406
9678/28840	Impossible   Yes really it is owing to him that we are	47.64533615112305
9679/28840	Owing to him   Yes he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin his valetdechambre and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de la F	20.363632202148438
9680/28840	Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted	302.465576171875
9681/28840	He even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with Grim	122.57289123535156
9682/28840	Well exclaimed Aramis this will reconcile me to him but I wish he were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so noble an	51.72624206542969
9683/28840	My lord said DArtagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the Chevalier dHerblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your em	31.834033966064453
9684/28840	And he retired discovering Mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of Aram	87.86389923095703
9685/28840	Ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize Halloo halloo friends to horse to horse   Several horsemen ran quickly to	138.93077087402344
9686/28840	I think it will be wise to set off said DArtagn	14.345234870910645
9687/28840	Yes but I am expecting some one a friend of Ath	53.54963302612305
9688/28840	And here he comes by Jupiter galloping through the	152.54107666015625
9689/28840	The count the count cried a young voice that made Athos	109.994873046875
9690/28840	For one moment the young man forgot his habitual respecthe threw himself on his fathers	83.60757446289062
9691/28840	He will indeed give us the favor of his company you will I hope be grateful for it Porthos do not lose sight of his em	43.24160385131836
9692/28840	Aramis then joined Athos and DArtagnan who were consulting	29.922138214111328
9693/28840	Come said DArtagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our	30.347742080688477
9694/28840	Where are we to go asked Porth	25.13428497314453
9695/28840	Come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you	48.209781646728516
9696/28840	The chances of war said Athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of	71.2862319946289
9697/28840	No but we shall make use of them said DArtagn	10.683095932006836
9698/28840	The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former	61.11630630493164
9699/28840	Mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phant	141.10696411132812
9700/28840	At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell	266.69976806640625
9701/28840	Horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed Porthos everything degener	114.79313659667969
9702/28840	I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin said Aram	28.38454818725586
9703/28840	He is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for	121.68206787109375
9704/28840	We at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us	100.91636657714844
9705/28840	Once beyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to	82.19902038574219
9706/28840	Grimaud in fact brought back five	731.4249267578125
9707/28840	The nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of Porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend	77.37452697753906
9708/28840	Ten minutes later the escort stopped at Ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding Mazarin	123.69561767578125
9709/28840	At noon they rode into the avenue of Pierref	52.06374740600586
9710/28840	We are four of us said DArtagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a	59.19825744628906
9711/28840	Athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege Porthos will see to the provisions and Aramis to the troops of the	53.94631576538086
9712/28840	That is to say Athos will be chief engineer Porthos purveyoringeneral and Aramis governor of the	33.07025909423828
9713/28840	Meanwhile they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chate	88.82096862792969
9714/28840	Gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect I presume to keep me here a long time incognito   No my lord replied the Gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you	44.88690185546875
9715/28840	And what shall you do   Defend	62.779396057128906
9716/28840	Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole	122.32688903808594
9717/28840	Such feats sir are done onceand never	1574.31591796875
9718/28840	However nowadays theres no need of so much	78.516845703125
9719/28840	Tomorrow the army of Paris will be summoned the day after it will be here The field of battle instead therefore of being at Saint Denis or at Charenton will be near Compiegne or VillarsCottere	45.237327575683594
9720/28840	The prince will vanquish you as he has always	108.32328033447266
9721/28840	Tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend Du Vallon who has	73.48963928222656
9722/28840	We will not expose your eminence to the chances of	38.89588165283203
9723/28840	Come answered Mazarin I see it will be necessary for me to capit	48.28968811035156
9724/28840	Before a siege   Yes the conditions will be better than	111.12850189208984
9725/28840	Ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are   Come now what are your conditions   Rest yourself first my lord and wewe will	76.72496032714844
9726/28840	I do not need rest gentlemen I need to know whether I am among enemies or	107.0437240600586
9727/28840	Friends my lord friends   Well then tell me at once what you want that I may see if any arrangement be	50.345481872558594
9728/28840	Speak Comte de la Fere   My lord replied Athos for myself I have nothing to	18.271440505981445
9729/28840	For France were I to specify my wishes I should have too	76.61700439453125
9730/28840	I beg you to excuse me and propose to the cheval	22.3709659576416
9731/28840	And Athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the	61.149417877197266
9732/28840	What do you want Nothing ambiguous if you	25.136516571044922
9733/28840	As for me replied Aramis I have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which I formed onewent yesterday to Saint Germain to impose on	53.4893913269043
9734/28840	Let us consider first the ancient	836.0151977539062
9735/28840	The demands in that programme must be	207.91307067871094
9736/28840	We were almost agreed on those replied Mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stip	131.20574951171875
9737/28840	You suppose then that there are some said Aramis	98.8502426147461
9738/28840	I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as Monsieur de la Fere replied the cardinal bowing to Ath	21.749475479125977
9739/28840	My lord you are right and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at	38.16004943847656
9740/28840	The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly	398.0078430175781
9741/28840	He is a proud soulhe is a man by himself You are righthe is worth us all and we avow it to you   Aramis said Athos are you jesting   No no dear friend I state only what we all	61.961280822753906
9742/28840	You are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant	132.488525390625
9743/28840	Well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited   I require my lord that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full abs	42.32623291015625
9744/28840	I require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the	70.60507202148438
9745/28840	That is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit France and be an	88.60193634033203
9746/28840	I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my	63.90778350830078
9747/28840	Mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to DArtagn	38.25886535644531
9748/28840	I my lord answered the Gascon I differ from Monsieur dHerblay entirely as to the last point though I agree with him on the	30.923173904418945
9749/28840	Far from wishing my lord to quit Paris I hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great states	53.760860443115234
9750/28840	I shall try also to help him to down the Fronde but on one conditionthat he sometimes remembers the kings faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could	91.27342987060547
9751/28840	And you Monsieur du Vallon   Yes you sir Speak if you please said Maz	18.198888778686523
9752/28840	You know sir that before receiving the order one must submit	381.22796630859375
9753/28840	Besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be	66.51213073730469
9754/28840	Mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly   All this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if I satisfy some I shall displease	176.89016723632812
9755/28840	True said Aramis so as I am in a minority I withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and monseigneurs	67.28681945800781
9756/28840	I am to remain minister then said Maz	57.80131912231445
9757/28840	You remain minister that is understood said DArtagnan France needs	88.05503845214844
9758/28840	And I desist from my pretensions said Aram	136.1622314453125
9759/28840	His eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for	70.73760986328125
9760/28840	Occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let France settle matters as she will with me resumed Maz	219.4518585205078
9761/28840	The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queens consent to	54.63786697387695
9762/28840	I can answer only for myself said Maz	39.79301834106445
9763/28840	Suppose her majesty refuses   Oh said DArtagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him	28.938472747802734
9764/28840	Here monseigneur said Aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of Fronde	27.371082305908203
9765/28840	Will your eminence please read and examine   I am acquainted with	87.85308837890625
9766/28840	Reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by	279.6567687988281
9767/28840	Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely	68.855712890625
9768/28840	Suppose I refuse   Then said DArtagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a	44.401039123535156
9769/28840	Would you dare to touch a cardinal   You have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musket	42.89508056640625
9770/28840	I do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to Paris and the Parisians will defend	41.44546890258789
9771/28840	How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain said Aram	35.56863021850586
9772/28840	Sign the treaty then monseigneur said Aram	27.614389419555664
9773/28840	Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it   Ah nonsense cried DArtagnan I can manage so that her majesty will receive me well I know an excellent	54.31490707397461
9774/28840	What   I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are	50.11650848388672
9775/28840	When I see her majesty embarrassed I shall conduct her to Rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a	126.56595611572266
9776/28840	Enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty   Here it is replied Aram	47.241363525390625
9777/28840	Sign my lord and he gave him a	67.81669616699219
9778/28840	Mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not de	1433.70703125
9779/28840	And when I have signed he said what is to be my guarantee   My word of honor sir said Ath	40.54547119140625
9780/28840	Mazarin started turned toward the Comte de la Fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the	79.81938934326172
9781/28840	It is sufficient count he said and signed the	211.69284057617188
9782/28840	And now Monsieur dArtagnan he said prepare to set off for Saint Germain and take a letter from me to the	20.470285415649414
9783/28840	Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the	507.83056640625
9784/28840	DArtagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing	66.81761932373047
9785/28840	He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to Chantilly so that he might be in Paris in five or six	91.28871154785156
9786/28840	But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind	98.19231414794922
9787/28840	In fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission Athos for generosity is a hero of romance Porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced Aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illeg	77.08606719970703
9788/28840	What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them The deliverance of the cardinal	65.6512222290039
9789/28840	Now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of Hercules were pyg	65.57807159423828
9790/28840	You my dear Chevalier dHerblay he said are the Fronde incarn	13.701346397399902
9791/28840	Mistrust Athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his	94.589111328125
9792/28840	Mistrust Porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as God on earth will assist him in contriving Mazarins escape if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chival	95.33158111572266
9793/28840	Aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and res	176.5022430419922

9796/28840	Good thought DArtagnan in this direction I am	33.1513557434082
9797/28840	He pressed Aramiss hand and went in search of Porth	57.80192565917969
9798/28840	What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go   Why I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so	51.74065017700195
9799/28840	Bravo Porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this Mazarin would have you	81.15283203125
9800/28840	Do you think so   I am sure of	13.225822448730469
9801/28840	Then I would kill him rather than let him	85.0758285522461
9802/28840	There is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the Frondeurs who besides dont understand political matters as we old soldiers	137.66514587402344
9803/28840	I shall see you through the window as you mount your horse I shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight then I shall place myself at the cardinals doora door with glass	62.28861618041992

9805/28840	Bravo thought DArtagnan on this side I think the cardinal will be well	72.73857879638672
9806/28840	He pressed the hand of the lord of Pierrefonds and went in search of Ath	36.01333236694336
9807/28840	My dear Athos he said I am going	35.25236892700195
9808/28840	I have only one thing to say to	16.689109802246094

9810/28840	I needed nothing less than that consideration my dear DArtagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jail	46.15324783325195
9811/28840	I give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave	27.880102157592773
9812/28840	This reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought DArtagn	30.83159637451172

9823/28840	The first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that	146.78317260742188
9824/28840	Then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of Athoss chamber and that of the	73.9097671508789
9825/28840	From the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the	108.5643081665039
9826/28840	He saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of Engh	55.943702697753906
9827/28840	He could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to Saint Germain to warn the queen of that	29.574098587036133
9828/28840	Now since DArtagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint Germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any	35.77660369873047
9829/28840	On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished	101.63523864746094
9830/28840	At the sight of DArtagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be	22.850866317749023
9831/28840	But DArtagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his	17.91742515563965
9832/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep Monsieur dArtagnan   Himself Monsieur Bernou	16.93263053894043
9833/28840	And why have you come here   To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarinthe freshest news there	27.927040100097656
9834/28840	What has become of him then   He is as well as you and	21.21424102783203
9835/28840	Nothing bad has happened to him then   Absolutely	121.16346740722656
9836/28840	He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de France and begged usthe Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallonto accompany	42.83340072631836
9837/28840	We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that	151.61170959472656
9838/28840	We set out last evening and here we	131.17678833007812
9839/28840	His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and privatea mission that could be confided only to a sure manand so has sent me to Saint Germ	94.06844329833984
9840/28840	And therefore my dear Monsieur Bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that I have come and tell her with what	30.282712936401367
9841/28840	DArtagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinals letter   It was however merely a letter of	36.31269454956055
9842/28840	The queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for	159.8012237548828
9843/28840	DArtagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on	63.159950256347656
9844/28840	The queen as he went on looked at him with increasing aston	60.96837615966797
9845/28840	She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish	73.23989868164062
9846/28840	There is here no question of crime or	235.05316162109375
9847/28840	Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison Monsieur du Vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles	36.749366760253906

9849/28840	We were then convinced my friend and I that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and	85.31852722167969
9850/28840	Now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and	178.1610870361328
9851/28840	We have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an	40.18913269042969
9852/28840	Well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a	99.82981872558594
9853/28840	We were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the Louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a	83.34590148925781
9854/28840	That proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully	154.449462890625
9855/28840	I listen to you and I wonder at you sir said the	26.9168701171875
9856/28840	In fact I have rarely seen such excess of imp	211.3256378173828
9857/28840	Your majesty on your side said DArtagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always	38.6736946105957
9858/28840	You are in error sir answered the	49.28725051879883
9859/28840	I am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour I shall set off at the head of my army to release my	51.173770904541016
9860/28840	I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous	41.72152328491211
9861/28840	Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should I find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all I could to induce you to change your	113.30474853515625
9862/28840	Well then I will content myself with arresting you   Madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should I not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to Paris and delivered to the	52.25926971435547
9863/28840	Your pardon madame I know all	45.55487060546875
9864/28840	And therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort nor to De Bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to DElbe	55.040565490722656
9865/28840	These gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good	89.47266387939453
9866/28840	He will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole	55.367530822753906
9867/28840	I think returned Anne of Austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans face would have expressed disdain but in a queens spread terror to those she looked upon nay I perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your	117.01950073242188
9868/28840	Madame replied DArtagnan I threaten simply and solely because I am obliged to do	34.154300689697266
9869/28840	What am I A poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which I have sought so long rests on me for a	123.09622955322266
9870/28840	Look at the Comte de la Fere a type of nobility a flower of ch	25.39503288269043
9871/28840	He has taken part against his queen or rather against her	138.28713989257812
9872/28840	He has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to	22.248003005981445
9873/28840	Look at Monsieur du Vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in	98.55255889892578
9874/28840	Why did you not say all this before you took action sir she	112.63683319091797
9875/28840	Because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubtedthat is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your	74.45450592041016
9876/28840	And that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what I	124.29307556152344
9877/28840	I ought muttered Anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are	119.14124298095703
9878/28840	Alas madame exclaimed DArtagnan this proves to me that not till today has your majesty had a just idea of	65.30353546142578
9879/28840	Perhaps said Anne but that idea if at last I have it   Your majesty will do us	86.00946044921875
9880/28840	In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar	160.42498779296875
9881/28840	You will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his	124.80793762207031
9882/28840	Where is the treaty   Here it	22.660737991333008
9883/28840	Anne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that DArtagnan presented to	40.190311431884766
9884/28840	We do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great	274.5929260253906
9885/28840	It is my intention so to do come let us hear	171.67140197753906
9886/28840	Tis the appointment Monsieur de Tréville held you ask of	37.422489166259766
9887/28840	The place madame is vacant and although tis a year since Monsieur de Tréville has left it it has not been	47.73439025878906
9888/28840	But it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings	36.83015060424805
9889/28840	Monsieur de Tréville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty	78.1465072631836
9890/28840	You have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and	91.0517807006836
9891/28840	Undoubtedly madame said DArtagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office	60.28038024902344
9892/28840	What more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her	66.99579620361328
9893/28840	A hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your	49.619144439697266
9894/28840	Nay it must have been a	84.93824768066406
9895/28840	A country clown said Anne of Austria people will	383.5026550292969

9897/28840	said the queen she signed a	427.71533203125
9898/28840	Now there remains the chevalier or the Abbé dHerblay as your majesty ple	18.530254364013672
9899/28840	Does he wish to be a bishop   No madame something easier to	77.39197540283203
9900/28840	What   It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of Madame de Longue	18.20870590209961
9901/28840	Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood madame said DArtagn	25.39287757873535
9902/28840	Yes said the queen but his son   His son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother	61.30970764160156
9903/28840	And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville   No madame for I presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of	43.6317024230957
9904/28840	As to the government of Normandy replied the queen I think I can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal	44.15938949584961
9905/28840	We shall search for some madame and I think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some	57.32257843017578

9911/28840	What is he then   The Comte de la Fere is a demig	13.014897346496582
9912/28840	If that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say   Perhaps he would	89.49608612060547
9913/28840	Perhaps   Yes if your majesty herself should beg him to	72.9924545288086
9914/28840	He must be indeed a strange	83.0130844116211
9915/28840	Well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg	115.43321228027344
9916/28840	Are you satisfied sir   There is one thing the queen has not signedher assent to the	65.92835235595703
9917/28840	Of what use today I will sign it	293.7256774902344
9918/28840	I can assure her majesty that if she does not sign today she will not have time to sign	68.85919189453125

9928/28840	And DArtagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in Annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much	84.48153686523438

10017/28840	The royal procession set out for	250.79391479492188
10018/28840	Guitant and Comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with DArtagnan on one side Porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of DArtagn	28.7581787109375
10019/28840	During twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night	233.6115264892578
10020/28840	The cortege proceeded to Notre Dame where a Te Deum was	120.33516693115234
10021/28840	The Swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep	72.32344818115234
10022/28840	This force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with	95.37477111816406
10023/28840	Whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen Anne looked at DArtagnan anx	65.77838134765625
10024/28840	At the Palais Royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint Hon	47.580360412597656
10025/28840	When the procession reached the palace loud cries of Long live their majesties res	95.5520248413086

10029/28840	Anne of Austria bent down and whispered in the young kings ear   Say something gracious to Monsieur dArtagnan my	47.23299789428711
10030/28840	The young king leaned toward the	120.07842254638672
10031/28840	I have not said goodmorning to you Monsieur dArtagnan he said nevertheless I have remarked	23.5596866607666

10034/28840	Sir said Mazarin to Porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us   Kill as many as I could my	40.042442321777344
10035/28840	Hem brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them	95.16797637939453

10037/28840	I think I should like the other fellow better than this one said Mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his	36.14397048950195
10038/28840	The queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel	175.86410522460938
10039/28840	The crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be	157.272216796875
10040/28840	Reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming stormand when they pass athwart a multitude presage an eme	238.70848083496094
10041/28840	DArtagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the	31.002155303955078
10042/28840	The ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to	300.2060852050781
10043/28840	At the Barriere des Sergents the procession was obliged to	42.32589340209961
10044/28840	Comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queens	52.510406494140625
10045/28840	An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken	450.1300964355469
10046/28840	Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the	70.88945770263672
10047/28840	Onward cried DArtagnan in a loud	17.293041229248047
10048/28840	But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded	81.59517669677734
10049/28840	Cries of Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal resounded on all	38.73163604736328
10050/28840	At the same time through the streets of Grenelle Saint Honore and Du Coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthoss horse and that of DArtagn	45.39458084106445
10051/28840	This new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed	68.38880920410156
10052/28840	It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized	59.77696990966797
10053/28840	Each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a	68.2072525024414
10054/28840	Both were evidently stimulated by the same	86.37776184082031
10055/28840	There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal	96.2152099609375
10056/28840	Myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns	80.7972183227539
10057/28840	One of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the	42.25239181518555
10058/28840	One went to support DArtagnan the other Porth	22.64558219909668
10059/28840	Then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were	130.97909545898438
10060/28840	Like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was	172.8325653076172
10061/28840	The musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give	108.29239654541016
10062/28840	DArtagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying   No sir I wish to see	21.788475036621094
10063/28840	If your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied DArtagn	47.41458511352539
10064/28840	And turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musket	63.06788635253906
10065/28840	Zounds give way   At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too	59.831321716308594
10066/28840	The blow was sped by DArtagnan the rapier had pierced his bos	52.48209762573242
10067/28840	Ah confound it cried the Gascon trying in vain too late to retract the	124.21996307373047
10068/28840	What the devil are you doing here count   Accomplishing my destiny replied Rochefort falling on one	41.944244384765625
10069/28840	I have already got up again after three stabs from you I shall never rise after this	127.7528076171875
10070/28840	Count said DArtagnan with some degree of emotion I struck without knowing that it was	27.392658233642578
10071/28840	I am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward	93.41403198242188
10072/28840	Rochefort extended his hand to DArtagnan who took	46.445838928222656
10073/28840	The count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled	111.24530029296875
10074/28840	He stiffened in the last convulsions of death and	52.10371780395508
10075/28840	Back people cried DArtagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business	43.924522399902344
10076/28840	Indeed as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him	51.40227508544922
10077/28840	DArtagnan returned to help Porthos if Porthos needed help but Porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as DArtagn	27.63042640686035
10078/28840	The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to	67.24752807617188
10079/28840	What a devil of a face you have Porthos and what a strange air for a victor   But you answered Porthos seem to me	52.59932327270508
10080/28840	Theres a reason Zounds I have just killed an old	77.51078796386719
10081/28840	Indeed replied Porthos who   That poor Count de Roche	23.99382209777832
10082/28840	Well exactly like me I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to	38.11774444580078
10083/28840	Unluckily I hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with	107.02315521240234
10084/28840	And he said nothing as he died   Yes he exclaimed Oh   I suppose answered DArtagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you	38.691864013671875
10085/28840	Madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your	162.00433349609375
10086/28840	In fact the procession arrived in safety at Notre Dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a Te De	76.9542236328125
10087/28840	Bazin felt some one pulling his	215.33135986328125

10092/28840	That great giant who was there gave it to	108.84851837158203
10093/28840	In that case said Bazin he must be pretty	92.79924011230469
10094/28840	So sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great	76.07875061035156
10095/28840	And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him   To be sure the coadjutor has	27.873218536376953
10096/28840	Who told you that   Monsieur Maillard	19.820037841796875

10100/28840	In fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative	72.26298522949219
10101/28840	He then returned with the same slow step and said   Go and tell the dying man that he must be	63.21599197387695

10105/28840	When the Te Deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so	73.56778717041016
10106/28840	Though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet	143.75274658203125
10107/28840	The door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was	28.101388931274414
10108/28840	A moment later Friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of	51.065399169921875
10109/28840	The mendicant had kept his word and made Friquet his	74.94712829589844

10136/28840	Take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are	108.77178192138672
10137/28840	The four friends embraced with tears in their	69.27416229248047
10138/28840	Then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other	81.7472915649414

10160/28840	Whats the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard   A great misfortune	78.88356018066406
10161/28840	Morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Lecle	24.318246841430664
10162/28840	And the cargo inquired the owner	472.58154296875
10163/28840	Morrel and I think you will be satisfied on that	51.10057067871094
10164/28840	But poor Captain Leclere   What happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable	22.831785202026367

10167/28840	The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the	66.79261016845703
10168/28840	And how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted	153.57525634765625
10169/28840	0023m       Alas sir in the most unexpected	12.90057373046875
10170/28840	After a long talk with the harbormaster Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in	115.99584197998047
10171/28840	In twentyfour hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days	81.25249481201172

10173/28840	We bring to his widow his sword and cross of	174.2366943359375
10174/28840	It was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the English for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody	65.00106811523438
10175/28840	Why you see Edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the	69.66935729980469
10176/28840	If not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo   Is all safe and sound	91.19725799560547
10177/28840	Morrel take my word for it and I advise you not to take 25000 francs for the profits of the	34.1054801940918
10178/28840	Then as they were just passing the Round Tower the young man shouted Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker   The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manof	53.54396438598633
10179/28840	Let goand clue up At this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly	166.19131469726562
10180/28840	Now if you will come on board	93.62822723388672
10181/28840	Morrel said Dantès observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo	37.9015007019043

10183/28840	As for me I must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in	140.62843322753906
10184/28840	The owner did not wait for a second	78.78435516357422
10185/28840	Morrel said Danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us   Yesyes poor Captain Leclere He was a brave and an honest	22.62779998779297
10186/28840	And a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel  Son replied Dangl	50.270084381103516
10187/28840	Yes said Danglars darting at Edmond a look gleaming with	35.35387420654297
10188/28840	Yes he is young and youth is invariably selfconf	110.7162094116211
10189/28840	Scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba instead of making for Marseilles	71.3401870727539
10190/28840	0025m       As to taking command of the vessel replied Morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed	57.85365295410156
10191/28840	The vessel was in as good condition as I am and as I hope you are	79.46306610107422
10192/28840	Morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing	72.06884002685547
10193/28840	Dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way   In a moment sir answered Dantès and Im with	24.245908737182617
10194/28840	Then calling to the crew he said Let go   The anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porth	145.2145538330078
10195/28840	And so in fact he is said the	130.46470642089844
10196/28840	Except your signature and your partners	356.28533935546875
10197/28840	And why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full	95.0689697265625
10198/28840	Morrel said Dantès approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and I am at your	36.0795783996582
10199/28840	You hailed me I think   Danglars retreated a step or	31.244796752929688
10200/28840	I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba   I do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere who when dying gave me a packet for Marshal Bert	31.371788024902344
10201/28840	Then did you see him Edmond   Who   The marsh	25.950176239013672
10202/28840	Morrel looked around him and then drawing Dantès on one side he said suddenly   And how is the emperor   Very well as far as I could judge from the sight of	25.33951187133789
10203/28840	You saw the emperor then   He entered the marshals apartment while I was	93.90185546875
10204/28840	And you spoke to him   Why it was he who spoke to me sir said Dantès with a	15.02052116394043
10205/28840	And what did he say to you   Asked me questions about the vessel the time she left Marseilles the course she had taken and what was her	79.3411865234375
10206/28840	I believe if she had not been laden and I had been her master he would have bought	58.483890533447266
10207/28840	But I told him I was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel 	46.1348876953125
10208/28840	Ah yes he said I know	64.69869995117188
10209/28840	The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Val	66.33084106445312
10210/28840	_Pardieu_ and that is true cried the owner greatly	72.2073974609375
10211/28840	And that was Policar Morrel my uncle who was afterwards a	99.72106170654297
10212/28840	Dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers	70.65090942382812
10213/28840	0027m       How could that bring me into trouble sir asked Dantès for I did not even know of what I was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first com	27.731843948364258
10214/28840	But pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming	203.2198944091797
10215/28840	And the young man went to the gang	44.378692626953125
10216/28840	As he departed Danglars approached and said   Well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at PortoFerrajo   Yes most satisfactory my dear Dangl	24.78905487060547
10217/28840	Well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his	51.515506744384766
10218/28840	Dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying	65.48448944091797
10219/28840	It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this	28.706029891967773
10220/28840	Talking of Captain Leclere has not Dantès given you a letter from him   To menowas there one   I believe that besides the packet Captain Leclere confided a letter to his	34.414432525634766
10221/28840	Of what packet are you speaking Danglars   Why that which Dantès left at PortoFerra	21.19940757751465
10222/28840	How do you know he had a packet to leave at PortoFerrajo   Danglars turned very	20.608274459838867
10223/28840	I was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantè	39.559303283691406
10224/28840	He did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to	35.23468780517578
10225/28840	Morrel I beg of you said he not to say a word to Dantès on the	22.434371948242188
10226/28840	At this moment the young man returned Danglars	30.330419540405273
10227/28840	Well my dear Dantès are you now free inquired the	39.04023361206055
10228/28840	I gave the customhouse officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom I gave	68.32906341552734
10229/28840	Then you have nothing more to do here   Noeverything is all right	37.85053253173828
10230/28840	Then you can come and dine with me   I really must ask you to excuse me	38.21278381347656
10231/28840	My first visit is due to my father though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done	60.19348907470703

10233/28840	I always knew you were a good	92.31380462646484
10234/28840	And inquired Dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is   Well I believe my dear Edmond though I have not seen him	21.730710983276367
10235/28840	Yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little	73.55292510986328
10236/28840	That proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your	81.95344543457031
10237/28840	My father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from	132.57510375976562
10238/28840	Well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on	91.11719512939453
10239/28840	Morrel for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to	61.27442932128906
10240/28840	True Dantès I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your fatherthe lovely Mercédè	34.693790435791016
10241/28840	Ah ha said the shipowner I am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon	40.61897277832031
10242/28840	_Peste_ Edmond you have a very handsome mistress   She is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrot	43.223976135253906
10243/28840	Sometimes one and the same thing said Morrel with a	21.74611473083496
10244/28840	Well well my dear Edmond continued the owner dont let me detain	51.82492446899414
10245/28840	You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your	59.401309967041016
10246/28840	Do you want any money   No sir I have all my pay to takenearly three months	76.55579376220703

10250/28840	Then I have your leave sir   Yes if you have nothing more to say to	28.969575881958008
10251/28840	Captain Leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me   He was unable to write	43.422645568847656
10252/28840	But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some	58.848472595214844
10253/28840	To get married   Yes first and then to go to	81.4621353149414

10256/28840	But the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two	101.69060516357422

10263/28840	Have you been satisfied with him this voyage   That is according to the sense you attach to the question	92.39572143554688
10264/28840	If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question I believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his	45.89595031738281
10265/28840	But tell me Dantès if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be glad to see Danglars remain   Captain or mate	30.196949005126953

10272/28840	The young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebi	53.251075744628906
10273/28840	On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailorbut there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantè	42.717018127441406
10274/28840	This room was occupied by Dantès	40.29338455200195
10275/28840	Suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a wellknown voice behind him exclaimed Fatherdear father   The old man uttered a cry and turned round then seeing his son he fell into his arms pale and	55.40415954589844

10283/28840	The good Captain Leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of	29.734209060668945
10284/28840	Do you understand father Only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for   Yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very	68.27014923095703

10294/28840	Yet stammered Dantès wiping the perspiration from his browyet I gave you two hundred francs when I left three months	20.17876434326172
10295/28840	Yes yes Edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor Cader	49.95318603515625
10296/28840	He reminded me of it telling me if I did not pay for you he would be paid by	43.68622589111328
10297/28840	Morrel and so you see lest he might do you an injury   Well   Why I paid	68.60762023925781
10298/28840	But cried Dantès it was a hundred and forty francs I owed Cader	26.29134178161621
10299/28840	And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you   The old man	33.2464485168457
10300/28840	So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered Ed	43.06031799316406

10314/28840	Ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured Ed	202.9207000732422
10315/28840	But never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so hes	146.691650390625
10316/28840	As Edmond paused the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the	31.035043716430664
10317/28840	He was a man of twentyfive or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat	45.60343551635742
10318/28840	What is it you Edmond back again said he with a broad Marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivorywhite	67.0168228149414
10319/28840	Yes as you see neighbor Caderousse and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied Dantès but illconcealing his coldness under this cloak of civ	42.48843002319336
10320/28840	Thanksthanks but fortunately I do not want for anything and it chances that at times there are others who have need of	102.29302215576172
10321/28840	I do not allude to you my	25.468952178955078

10323/28840	We are never quits with those who oblige us was Dantès reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them	99.71835327148438
10324/28840	Whats the use of mentioning that What is done is	284.4849853515625
10325/28840	Let us talk of your happy return my	139.98590087890625
10326/28840	I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when I met friend Dangl	46.06266784667969
10327/28840	I was but am now back	378.2821350097656
10328/28840	And where is the dear boy our little Edmond   Why with his father no doubt replied Dangl	45.74717712402344
10329/28840	And so I came added Caderousse as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a	60.534751892089844
10330/28840	0037m       Worthy Caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to	11.979190826416016
10331/28840	I love and esteem you because honest folks are so	109.23697662353516
10332/28840	But it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the	75.39378356933594
10333/28840	The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his	74.1480484008789
10334/28840	Eh he said negligently this money is not	55.977516174316406
10335/28840	I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the	68.9937515258789
10336/28840	Come father added Dantès put this money back in your boxunless neighbor Caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his	62.38641357421875
10337/28840	I am not in any want thank God my living is suited to my	133.8255157470703
10338/28840	Keep your moneykeep it I sayone never has too muchbut at the same time my boy I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of	66.70288848876953
10339/28840	It was offered with good will said Dantè	106.25740814208984
10340/28840	Morrel I hearyou insinuating dog you  	284.30560302734375
10341/28840	Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied Dantè	21.551820755004883
10342/28840	Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with	67.90580749511719
10343/28840	What did you refuse to dine with him said old Dantès and did he invite you to dine   Yes my dear father replied Edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his	30.51111602783203
10344/28840	And why did you refuse my son inquired the old	37.883628845214844
10345/28840	That I might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young	49.137237548828125
10346/28840	I was most anxious to see	24.70471954345703
10347/28840	And when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the	119.29421997070312
10348/28840	But I explained to him the cause of my refusal replied Dantès and I hope he fully understood	33.917301177978516
10349/28840	Yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones	95.03887176513672
10350/28840	I hope to be captain without that said Dantè	34.37883758544922
10351/28840	So much the betterso much the better Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear	51.46908950805664
10352/28840	Yes my dear father and with your permission now I have seen you and know you are well and have all you require I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catal	47.187828063964844
10353/28840	No but according to all probability she soon will be replied Ed	99.71283721923828
10354/28840	Yesyes said Caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my	42.90349578857422
10355/28840	And why   Because Mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by	73.10179901123047
10356/28840	Really answered Edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneas	52.02817153930664
10357/28840	Come come said the sailor I have a better opinion than you of women in general and of Mercédès in particular and I am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to	63.05826950073242
10358/28840	So much the betterso much the better said Cader	25.974918365478516
10359/28840	When one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence but never mind that my boygo and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and	80.16569519042969
10360/28840	I will go directly was Edmonds reply and embracing his father and nodding to Caderousse he left the	46.25884246826172
10361/28840	Caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old Dantès he went downstairs to rejoin Danglars who awaited him at the corner of the Rue Sen	20.10474967956543
10362/28840	Well said Danglars did you see him   I have just left him answered Cader	13.516480445861816
10363/28840	Did he allude to his hope of being captain   He spoke of it as a thing already	83.2367935180664
10364/28840	Indeed said Danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to	22.60382652282715
10365/28840	So that he is quite elated about it   Why yes he is actually insolent over the matterhas already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a	60.78512191772461
10366/28840	Which you refused   Most assuredly although I might easily have accepted it for it was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now	93.10200500488281
10367/28840	Dantès has no longer any occasion for assistancehe is about to become a	38.53810501098633
10368/28840	Pooh said Danglars he is not one	30.891218185424805
10369/28840	_Ma foi_ it will be as well if he is not answered Caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to	40.32982635498047
10370/28840	If we choose replied Danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he	51.56593322753906
10371/28840	What do you mean   NothingI was speaking to	32.027339935302734
10372/28840	And is he still in love with the Catalane   Over head and ears but unless I am much mistaken there will be a storm in that	58.6629753112793
10373/28840	0041m       Explain	12.42322826385498
10374/28840	Why should I   It is more important than you think	60.50153350830078
10375/28840	You do not like Dantès   I never like upst	37.22867202758789
10376/28840	Then tell me all you know about the Catal	56.08138656616211
10377/28840	I know nothing for certain only I have seen things which induce me to believe as I told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmer	45.00835037231445
10378/28840	What have you seencome tell me   Well every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed Catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls	77.78240203857422
10379/28840	Really and you think this cousin pays her attentions   I only suppose	72.66155242919922
10380/28840	What else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen   And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans   He went before I came	36.60710525512695
10381/28840	Let us go the same way we will stop at La Réserve and we can drink a glass of La Malgue whilst we wait for	59.3350944519043
10382/28840	Come along said Caderousse but you pay the	81.22510528564453
10383/28840	Of course replied Danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two	53.74357223510742
10384/28840	The Catalans   Beyond a bare weatherworn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the Catal	57.07457733154297
10385/28840	Long ago this mysterious colony quitted Spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this	110.09751892089844
10386/28840	Whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown	398.82891845703125
10387/28840	One of its chiefs who understood Provençal begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats	79.69889831542969
10388/28840	The request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang	88.15927124023438
10389/28840	This village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half Moorish half Spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their	174.4080047607422

10391/28840	He questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his	50.15430450439453
10392/28840	You see Mercédès said the young man here is Easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding   I have answered you a hundred times Fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me	44.063682556152344
10393/28840	Well repeat itrepeat it I beg of you that I may at last believe it Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mothers	72.92887115478516
10394/28840	Make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to	81.98143005371094
10395/28840	I have always said to you I love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is another	81.74386596679688
10396/28840	You are included in the conscription Fernand and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up	110.4351806640625
10397/28840	But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and sell and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spinI feel very keenly Fernand that this is	130.80502319335938
10398/28840	I understand replied Fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share	99.44831085205078
10399/28840	Well Mercédès beloved by you I would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and I should become	54.77677536010742
10400/28840	I could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer	183.3119354248047
10401/28840	You could do no such thing Fernand you are a soldier and if you remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as I cannot give you	48.99376678466797

10407/28840	No Fernand you will not thus give way to evil	141.17588806152344
10408/28840	Fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of Mercédès although for each of these tears he would have shed his hearts blood but these tears flowed for	57.495723724365234
10409/28840	And you will always love him   As long as I	46.14527130126953
10410/28840	Edmond and Mercédès were clasped in each others	28.26131248474121
10411/28840	The burning Marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of	75.01262664794922
10412/28840	At first they saw nothing around	184.74755859375
10413/28840	Their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of	99.43289184570312
10414/28840	Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of Fernand as it was defined in the	60.18135070800781
10415/28840	By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his	68.0950698852539
10416/28840	Ah your pardon said Dantès frowning in his turn I did not perceive that there were three of	23.931039810180664
10417/28840	Do you not remember him   Yes said Dantès and without relinquishing Mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial	28.108243942260742
10418/28840	But Fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and	169.08364868164062
10419/28840	Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing	62.838130950927734
10420/28840	This look told him all and his anger waxed	451.264404296875
10421/28840	I did not know when I came with such haste to you that I was to meet an enemy	39.49204635620117
10422/28840	An enemy cried Mercédès with an angry look at her	32.839088439941406
10423/28840	An enemy in my house do you say Edmond If I believed that I would place my arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles leaving the house to return to it no	78.03018188476562
10424/28840	But you are deceived Edmond she	85.1211929321289
10425/28840	You have no enemy herethere is no one but Fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted	80.44649505615234
10426/28840	And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards Edmond and offered him his	53.02323913574219
10427/28840	His hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised over	103.07703399658203
10428/28840	Scarcely however had he touched Edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the	59.66958236694336
10429/28840	Oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairOh who will deliver me from this man Wretchedwretched that I am   Hallo Catalan Hallo Fernand where are you running to exclaimed a	92.85939025878906
10430/28840	The young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars under an ar	34.33385467529297
10431/28840	Well said Caderousse why dont you come Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends   Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added Dangl	38.31401062011719
10432/28840	Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a	20.75223731994629
10433/28840	He seems besotted said Danglars pushing Caderousse with his	38.47200393676758
10434/28840	You called me didnt you And he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the	99.18584442138672
10435/28840	I called you because you were running like a madman and I was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said Caderousse	41.494747161865234
10436/28840	Well Fernand I must say said Caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse	78.75633239746094
10437/28840	Bah said Danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in	63.767574310302734
10438/28840	No he replied only hark how he sighs Come come Fernand said Caderousse hold up your head and answer	110.45281982421875
10439/28840	Its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your	200.14759826660156
10440/28840	My health is well enough said Fernand clenching his hands without raising his	81.47830200195312
10441/28840	Poor Fernand has been dismissed continued Cader	120.53903198242188
10442/28840	But I thought you were a Catalan and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a	46.882930755615234
10443/28840	It was even told me that Fernand especially was terrible in his	197.17271423339844
10444/28840	A lover is never terrible he	542.5857543945312
10445/28840	Poor fellow remarked Danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his	37.62510299682617
10446/28840	Why you see he did not expect to see Dantès return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless These things always come on us more severely when they come	107.5448989868164
10447/28840	Well never mind answered Caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while Danglars had merely sipped	48.341915130615234
10448/28840	Never mindin the meantime he marries Mercédèsthe lovely Mercédèsat least he returns to do	126.09910583496094
10449/28840	During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart Caderousses words fell like molten	36.39704132080078
10450/28840	And when is the wedding to be he	202.27410888671875
10451/28840	Oh it is not yet fixed murmured	89.00972747802734
10452/28840	Well said he filling the glasses let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantès husband of the beautiful Catalane   Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a g	39.36415100097656
10453/28840	What do I see down there by the wall in the direction of the Catalans Look Fernand your eyes are better than	75.00526428222656
10454/28840	You know wine is a deceiver but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in	155.05691528320312
10455/28840	Heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing   Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand	48.44152069091797
10456/28840	Do you know them Fernand he	128.9266815185547
10457/28840	Yes was the reply in a low	28.116119384765625
10458/28840	Hold your tongue will you said Danglars pretending to restrain Caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the ar	44.289878845214844
10459/28840	Try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without	196.78451538085938
10460/28840	At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died and dropped again heavily on his	153.18936157226562
10461/28840	Danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with	57.37483596801758
10462/28840	I shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a	82.12423706054688
10463/28840	Heres an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big	136.83724975585938
10464/28840	Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards Sicilians and Calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one	97.05448913574219
10465/28840	Unquestionably Edmonds star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girlhe will be captain too and laugh at us all unlessa sinister smile passed over Danglars lipsunless I take a hand in the affair he	103.89974975585938
10466/28840	Ah very well thats an explanation said Cader	50.76285171508789
10467/28840	So call me Mercédès if you	21.576766967773438
10468/28840	We must excuse our worthy neighbor Caderousse said Dantès he is so easily	40.94675827026367
10469/28840	So then the wedding is to take place immediately	130.73934936523438
10470/28840	Dantès said Danglars bowing to the young	9.918624877929688
10471/28840	Danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my fathers and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at La Réser	42.743019104003906
10472/28840	My friends will be there I hope that is to say you are invited	64.5214614868164
10473/28840	And Fernand said Caderousse with a chuckle Fernand too is invited   My wifes brother is my brother said Edmond and we Mercédès and I should be very sorry if he were absent at such a	35.9104118347168
10474/28840	Fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a	32.543270111083984
10475/28840	Your pardon replied Danglars I merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the _Pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in less than three	46.2498893737793
10476/28840	We are always in a hurry to be happy	63.255584716796875
10477/28840	Danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good	30.776947021484375
10478/28840	But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste I must go to	65.4000473022461
10479/28840	Ah reallyto Paris and will it be the first time you have ever been there Dantès  	36.714107513427734
10480/28840	Have you business there   Not of my own the last commission of poor Captain Leclere you know to what I allude Danglarsit is	51.55164337158203
10481/28840	Besides I shall only take the time to go and	65.14500427246094
10482/28840	Yes yes I understand said Danglars and then in a low tone he added To Paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave	30.352039337158203
10483/28840	Ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea Ah Dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship _Pharaon_ then turning towards Edmond who was walking away A pleasant journey he	56.373870849609375
10484/28840	Thank you said Edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of	58.78828811645508
10485/28840	Well my dear sir said Danglars to Fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody	39.535308837890625
10486/28840	It drives me to despair said	268.8564758300781
10487/28840	Do you then love Mercédès   I adore her   For long   As long as I have known her	30.31290054321289
10488/28840	And you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition I did not think that was the way of your	100.94105529785156
10489/28840	What would you have me do said	99.64981079101562
10490/28840	How do I know Is it my affair I am not in love with Mademoiselle Mercédès but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall	36.67542266845703
10491/28840	What   I would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill	38.547977447509766
10492/28840	Pooh Women say those things but never do	265.2666931152344
10493/28840	You do not know Mercédès what she threatens she will	21.518383026123047
10494/28840	Thats love or I dont know what love	174.281982421875
10495/28840	Drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all ones wit and cool	143.60060119628906
10496/28840	Idrunk said Caderousse well thats a good one I could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne fl	243.51039123535156
10497/28840	Père Pamphile more wine   And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the	35.5163688659668
10498/28840	You were saying sir said Fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted	219.1079559326172
10499/28840	This drunken Caderousse has made me lose the thread of my	101.86924743652344
10500/28840	Death alone can separate them remarked	478.72479248046875
10501/28840	You talk like a noodle my friend said Caderousse and here is Danglars who is a wideawake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are	43.3621940612793
10502/28840	Say there is no need why Dantès should die it would indeed be a pity he	63.59209442138672
10503/28840	Dantès is a good fellow I like Dantè	14.740522384643555
10504/28840	Let him run on said Danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he	51.32182312011719
10505/28840	Absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tomb	70.74674987792969
10506/28840	And why I should like to know persisted Caderousse should they put Dantès in prison he has neither robbed nor killed nor	52.50527572631836
10507/28840	I wont hold my tongue replied Caderousse I say I want to know why they should put Dantès in prison I like Dantès Dantès your health and he swallowed another glass of	37.805023193359375
10508/28840	0057m       Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards Fernand said Well you understand there is no need to kill	34.43560791015625
10509/28840	Certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having Dantès	57.6609001159668
10510/28840	Have you that means   It is to be found for the	77.44340515136719
10511/28840	But why should I meddle in the matter it is no affair of	31.79103660583496
10512/28840	I know not why you meddle said Fernand seizing his arm but this I know you have some motive of personal hatred against Dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of	53.188560485839844
10513/28840	No no said Fernand restraining him stay It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dantè	58.71310043334961
10514/28840	I hate him I confess it	83.70693969726562
10515/28840	Do you find the means I will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for Mercédès has declared she will kill herself if Dantès is	41.764766693115234
10516/28840	I wont have Dantès killedI wont   And who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied Dangl	40.08634567260742
10517/28840	We were merely joking drink to his health he added filling Caderousses glass and do not interfere with	76.24232482910156
10518/28840	Yes yes Dantès good health said Caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah   But the meansthe means said	44.75764846801758
10519/28840	Have you not hit upon any asked Dangl	54.57986068725586
10520/28840	True replied Danglars the French have the superiority over the Spaniards that the Spaniards ruminate while the French	55.46106719970703
10521/28840	Do you invent then said Fernand impatient	169.03591918945312
10522/28840	Waiter said Danglars pen ink and	59.81965637207031
10523/28840	Yes I am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools I am fit for	71.7364730834961
10524/28840	Pen ink and paper then called Fernand	518.3515625
10525/28840	Theres what you want on that table said the	159.83224487304688
10526/28840	The waiter did as he was	290.33355712890625
10527/28840	The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said Dangl	28.092666625976562
10528/28840	Fernand filled Caderousses glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the	105.36356353759766
10529/28840	The Catalan watched him until Caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the	89.1417007446289
10530/28840	Well resumed the Catalan as he saw the final glimmer of Caderousses reason vanishing before the last glass of	59.16128921508789
10531/28840	Yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced I will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for I know the fact	108.0960464477539
10532/28840	Yes and Mercédès Mercédès who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond   True said	27.01263427734375
10533/28840	No no continued Danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as I now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we	56.64769744873047
10534/28840	Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon	41.26449203491211
10535/28840	And Danglars wrote the address as he	43.50384521484375
10536/28840	Yes and thats all settled exclaimed Caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must	61.88359451293945
10537/28840	Yes and thats all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the	39.19956588745117
10538/28840	Dantès is my friend and I wont have him ill	35.373374938964844
10539/28840	And who thinks of using him ill Certainly neither I nor Fernand said Danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the	61.37289047241211
10540/28840	In this case replied Caderousse lets have some more	70.6460952758789
10541/28840	I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédè	16.475059509277344
10542/28840	You have had too much already drunkard said Danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your	50.426185607910156
10543/28840	Give me your arm and let us	70.71760559082031

10547/28840	Come along Danglars and let the young gentleman return to the Catalans if he	42.06028747558594
10548/28840	Danglars took advantage of Caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte SaintVictor staggering as he	22.38753318786621
10549/28840	When they had advanced about twenty yards Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pill	56.091392517089844
10550/28840	Well said Caderousse why what a lie he told He said he was going to the Catalans and he is going to the	47.313045501708984
10551/28840	Hallo Fernand You are coming my boy   Oh you dont see straight said Danglars hes gone right by the road to the Vieilles Infirmer	64.06143188476562

10553/28840	The Marriage Feast   The mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of rubytinted	86.14010620117188
10554/28840	The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Réserve with whose arbor the reader is already	70.22880554199219
10555/28840	Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the _Pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be	55.73654556274414
10556/28840	Danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by Caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with	40.169761657714844
10557/28840	Morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Réser	24.73535919189453
10558/28840	Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each	33.11167526245117
10559/28840	Having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with Edmond Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside Fernand and old Dantèsthe latter of whom attracted universal	48.49015426635742
10560/28840	The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and	91.14652252197266
10561/28840	His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of English manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue rib	86.45255279541016
10562/28840	Thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuiler	86.59092712402344
10563/28840	Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios Mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral	115.47334289550781
10564/28840	She moved with the light free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalus	135.81666564941406
10565/28840	As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Réserve	34.536930084228516
10566/28840	Morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Lecle	53.7990837097168
10567/28840	Edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of	62.568111419677734
10568/28840	Morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several	91.60472106933594
10569/28840	During this time Dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored	49.08354949951172
10570/28840	Morrel was seated at his right hand Danglars at his left while at a sign from Edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most	45.37026596069336

10572/28840	A pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before Mercédès	44.09709548950195
10573/28840	Now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away   Ah sighed Caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be	108.3207015991211
10574/28840	The truth is replied Dantès that I am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as	81.2069091796875
10575/28840	Danglars looked towards Fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh	163.55462646484375
10576/28840	Why what ails you asked he of Ed	46.33707809448242
10577/28840	Do you fear any approaching evil I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this	119.14686584472656
10578/28840	And that is the very thing that alarms me returned Dantè	28.980085372924805
10579/28840	I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of Mercédè	47.8435173034668
10580/28840	Nay nay cried Caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor	67.10773468017578
10581/28840	Well never mind that neighbor Caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as	33.75441360473633
10582/28840	Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will	40.21568298339844
10583/28840	A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder Dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white	51.8499641418457
10584/28840	Mercédès looked pleased and gratified while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive	30.887426376342773
10585/28840	In an hour inquired Danglars turning	16.6831111907959
10586/28840	How is that my friend   Why thus it is replied Dantè	24.954570770263672
10587/28840	Morrel to whom next to my father I owe every blessing I enjoy every difficulty has been	127.53655242919922
10588/28840	We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at halfpast two oclock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city	47.892513275146484
10589/28840	Now as a quarterpast one has already struck I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantè	62.59902572631836
10590/28840	Upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of	65.25606536865234
10591/28840	Mercédès has no fortune I have none to settle on	23.74053955078125
10592/28840	So you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very	235.92845153808594
10593/28840	This joke elicited a fresh burst of	145.21018981933594
10594/28840	So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said Dangl	58.97111892700195
10595/28840	No no answered Dantès dont imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby	44.860477447509766
10596/28840	Tomorrow morning I start for Paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time I shall be	70.1990737915039
10597/28840	I shall be back here by the first of March and on the second I give my real marriage	77.3707275390625
10598/28840	Dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Ed	36.96104431152344
10599/28840	Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of	106.760498046875
10600/28840	Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable	85.1185531616211
10601/28840	Everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own	76.41924285888672
10602/28840	Fernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Dangl	67.56708526611328
10603/28840	Caderousse approached him just as Danglars whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the	57.928184509277344
10604/28840	I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning	55.94194412231445
10605/28840	Caderousse looked full at Fernandhe was ghastly	108.6949462890625
10606/28840	Certainly continued Danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is	53.568302154541016
10607/28840	Upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog Gad I only wish he would let me take his	90.84695434570312
10608/28840	Shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of Mercédès two oclock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an	44.12644958496094
10609/28840	0071m       To be sureto be sure cried Dantès eagerly quitting the table let us go directly   His words were reechoed by the whole party with vociferous	23.6798152923584
10610/28840	At this moment Danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open	54.13928985595703
10611/28840	Three blows were struck upon the panel of the	186.61439514160156
10612/28840	The company looked at each other in constern	39.1995735168457
10613/28840	I demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law As no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corpor	64.81220245361328
10614/28840	Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those	171.69398498535156
10615/28840	May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said	97.5962142944336
10616/28840	Morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily	183.9266815185547
10617/28840	If it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile I am the bearer of an order of arrest and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be	107.87638092041016
10618/28840	Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was	139.8362579345703
10619/28840	He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effig	81.47037506103516
10620/28840	There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to	74.46753692626953
10621/28840	He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said My worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehens	124.5772933959961
10622/28840	Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his	95.83031463623047
10623/28840	What is the meaning of all this inquired Caderousse frowningly of Danglars who had assumed an air of utter	34.85784912109375
10624/28840	0073m       How can I tell you replied he I am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is	32.80365753173828
10625/28840	Caderousse then looked around for Fernand but he had	77.13923645019531
10626/28840	The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clear	131.5135498046875
10627/28840	The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his	99.45789337158203
10628/28840	Nonsense returned Danglars I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that I tore the paper to	44.643550872802734
10629/28840	No you did not answered Caderousse you merely threw it byI saw it lying in a	95.1456527709961
10630/28840	Hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk   Where is Fernand inquired Cader	74.13139343261719
10631/28840	How do I know replied Danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most	74.19851684570312
10632/28840	Never mind where he is let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor	67.81901550292969
10633/28840	0075m       Oh to be sure responded Danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake I feel quite	27.49378204345703
10634/28840	Dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the	24.617816925048828
10635/28840	A carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards Marse	66.95794677734375
10636/28840	Adieu adieu dearest Edmond cried Mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the	37.47874069213867
10637/28840	The prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out Goodbye Mercédèswe shall soon meet again Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint	85.42493438720703
10638/28840	Wait for me here all of you cried	244.73101806640625
10639/28840	Morrel I will take the first conveyance I find and hurry to Marseilles whence I will bring you word how all is going	88.7139663696289
10640/28840	Thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can   This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left	81.4487075805664
10641/28840	The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others	55.71752166748047
10642/28840	He is the cause of all this miseryI am quite sure of it whispered Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off Fernand to Dangl	35.11555862426758
10643/28840	I dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a	98.4367446899414
10644/28840	I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought	85.97858428955078
10645/28840	You dont mention those who aided and abetted the deed said Cader	128.59095764160156
10646/28840	Surely answered Danglars one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the	85.60700225830078
10647/28840	You can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys	163.55422973632812
10648/28840	Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different	102.43257141113281
10649/28840	What think you Danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event   Why replied he I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contr	52.96372985839844
10650/28840	But how could he have done so without your knowledge Danglars since you are the ships supercargo   Why as for that I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was lad	45.597476959228516
10651/28840	I know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastrets warehouse and at Smyrna from Pascals that is all I was obliged to know and I beg I may not be asked for any further	48.308780670166016
10652/28840	Now I recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me   There you see exclaimed Dangl	66.71949005126953
10653/28840	Now the mischief is out depend upon it the customhouse people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor Dantès hidden	244.65133666992188
10654/28840	Mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers	41.29903030395508
10655/28840	Her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sob	126.96804809570312
10656/28840	Come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope   Hope repeated Dangl	40.011512756347656
10657/28840	Hope faintly murmured Fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his count	63.10404968261719
10658/28840	Good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the	171.17294311523438
10659/28840	No doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released   Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the	30.260622024536133
10660/28840	What news exclaimed a general burst of	312.4371643066406
10661/28840	Morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I	62.41682434082031
10662/28840	Oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth Mercédè	74.37480926513672
10663/28840	Morrel but still he is charged   With what inquired the elder Dantè	41.951194763183594
10664/28840	With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is	87.51922607421875
10665/28840	A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès the old man sank into a	43.05070877075195
10666/28840	Ah Danglars whispered Caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but I cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your	67.591796875
10667/28840	I am determined to tell them all about	23.17191505432129
10668/28840	Be silent you simpleton cried Danglars grasping him by the arm or I will not answer even for your own	47.64701843261719
10669/28840	Who can tell whether Dantès be innocent or guilty The vessel did touch at Elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the	74.90139770507812
10670/28840	Suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his	163.7476806640625
10671/28840	If he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a	87.22030639648438
10672/28840	With all my heart replied Danglars pleased to find the other so tract	50.81769561767578
10673/28840	Let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their	71.83064270019531
10674/28840	After their departure Fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of Dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the Allées de Meil	45.84506607055664
10675/28840	The rumor of Edmonds arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the	55.35049819946289
10676/28840	Could you ever have credited such a thing my dear Danglars asked	41.81867218017578
10677/28840	Morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès from	47.35723876953125
10678/28840	de Villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and Cader	31.862918853759766
10679/28840	Could you have believed such a thing possible   Why you know I told you replied Danglars that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious	27.377262115478516
10680/28840	And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself   0079m       Certainly not returned Dangl	25.811893463134766
10681/28840	Then added in a low whisper You understand that on account of your uncle	89.90032958984375
10682/28840	Policar Morrel who served under the _other_ government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of	90.53372955322266
10683/28840	I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself had I divulged my own apprehensions to a	105.786376953125
10684/28840	I am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all	111.9678955078125
10685/28840	You are a worthy fellow and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon	26.249134063720703
10686/28840	Is it possible you were so kind   Yes indeed I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between	41.84870147705078
10687/28840	And what was his reply   That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference	128.54002380371094
10688/28840	No one can deny his being a noblehearted young	207.98159790039062
10689/28840	Morrel here is the _Pharaon_ without a	26.123779296875
10690/28840	Oh replied Danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at	36.650367736816406
10691/28840	No doubt but in the meantime   I am entirely at your service	23.382827758789062
10692/28840	Thanks Danglarsthat will smooth over all	150.2074432373047
10693/28840	I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_ and look carefully to the unloading of her	26.080291748046875
10694/28840	Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with	38.66871643066406
10695/28840	Morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond   I will let you know that directly I have seen	30.565345764160156
10696/28840	de Villefort whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmonds	40.1783561706543
10697/28840	I am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and I fancy not a bad sort of	54.556758880615234
10698/28840	Perhaps not replied Danglars but I hear that he is ambitious and thats rather against	43.84572982788086
10699/28840	But now hasten on board I will join you there ere	78.17658233642578
10700/28840	So saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the Palais de	23.297008514404297
10701/28840	0081m       You see said Danglars addressing Caderousse the turn things have	18.964893341064453
10702/28840	Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence   Not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such	59.325557708740234
10703/28840	But who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but Fernand you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the roomindeed I fancied I had destroyed	75.16885375976562
10704/28840	Oh no replied Caderousse that I can answer for you did	21.9685001373291
10705/28840	I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the ar	58.46975326538086
10706/28840	Well then if you did depend upon it Fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying	92.9760513305664

10857/28840	Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel and replied coldly   You are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great	40.613582611083984
10858/28840	Is it not true   The magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indul	63.647064208984375
10859/28840	Morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grandmarshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed	44.74490737915039
10860/28840	He replied however in a tone of deep interest   I entreat you	33.71862030029297
10861/28840	de Villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us	93.40677642822266
10862/28840	This _give us_ sounded revolutionary in the deputys	116.69281005859375
10863/28840	Ah ah murmured he is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form He was if I recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many	108.35480499267578

10866/28840	Rapid as had been Villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrog	52.4552001953125

10868/28840	Villeforts first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two	81.04560089111328
10869/28840	He stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his	113.15303039550781
10870/28840	He was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in	74.87348175048828
10871/28840	It was then that he encountered for the first time Villeforts lookthat look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his	66.46073913574219

10876/28840	This philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at	117.25234985351562
10877/28840	de SaintMérans and he arranged mentally while Dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloqu	87.49502563476562
10878/28840	When this speech was arranged Villefort turned to Dantè	29.94719696044922

10883/28840	It is reported your political opinions are extreme said Villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an	68.38267517089844
10884/28840	Alas sir I never had any	245.82904052734375
10885/28840	I am hardly nineteen I know nothing I have no part to	71.14082336425781
10886/28840	If I obtain the situation I desire I shall owe it to	98.62928009033203

10888/28840	This sir is all I can tell you and you see how uninteresting it	33.97035217285156
10889/28840	As Dantès spoke Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of Renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for	42.261085510253906
10890/28840	With the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his	116.42097473144531
10891/28840	_Pardieu_ said Villefort he is a noble	24.577423095703125
10892/28840	I hope I shall gain Renées favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on	156.6519775390625
10893/28840	I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in	101.31085968017578
10894/28840	Full of this idea Villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to Dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling	42.568138122558594
10895/28840	Sir said Villefort have you any enemies at least that you	25.507339477539062
10896/28840	I have enemies replied Dantès my position is not sufficiently elevated for	43.08910369873047
10897/28840	As for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but I have striven to repress	96.5476303100586
10898/28840	I have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for I am too young but as an elder	74.03255462646484
10899/28840	You are about to become captain at nineteenan elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of	85.65016174316406
10900/28840	You are right you know men better than I do and what you say may possibly be the case I confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances I prefer not to know it because then I should be forced to hate	63.52048110961914
10901/28840	You are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around	116.67082214355469
10902/28840	You seem a worthy young man I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this	68.20409393310547
10903/28840	Here is the paper do you know the writing As he spoke Villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Dantè	25.896326065063477
10904/28840	A cloud passed over his brow as he said   No monsieur I do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably	24.06475257873535
10905/28840	I am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at Villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real	48.40559005737305
10906/28840	And by the rapid glance that the young mans eyes shot forth Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mild	75.25790405273438
10907/28840	I will tell you the real	38.278018951416016
10908/28840	I swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for Mercédès by the life of my father   Speak monsieur said Ville	17.85015296936035

10910/28840	Well when we quitted Naples Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain	63.20896911621094
10911/28840	As we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to	53.12247085571289
10912/28840	My dear Dantès said he swear to perform what I am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest	28.228395462036133
10913/28840	You will accomplish what I was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from	85.5119400024414
10914/28840	I will do it captain but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grandmarshals presence as easily as you expect   Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the	80.27700805664062
10915/28840	At these words he gave me a	50.20895767211914
10916/28840	It was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he	76.81853485107422
10917/28840	And what did you do then   What I ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my	36.395633697509766
10918/28840	Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are	102.53211975097656
10919/28840	I sailed for the Island of Elba where I arrived the next day I ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore	64.33163452148438
10920/28840	As I had expected I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grandmarshal but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him and was instantly	61.58833312988281
10921/28840	He questioned me concerning Captain Lecleres death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in	61.67014694213867
10922/28840	I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me	124.43926239013672
10923/28840	I landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom I found more lovely than	71.63481140136719
10924/28840	Ah said Villefort this seems to me the	30.762121200561523
10925/28840	If you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your	33.3935432434082
10926/28840	Give up this letter you have brought from Elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your	91.23148345947266
10927/28840	I am free then sir cried Dantès joy	23.958345413208008
10928/28840	Yes but first give me this	73.30397033691406
10929/28840	You have it already for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that	83.7838134765625
10930/28840	Stop a moment said the deputy as Dantès took his hat and	48.966453552246094
10931/28840	To whom is it addressed   _To Monsieur Noirtier Rue CoqHéron	27.44426155090332

10933/28840	He sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of	75.83716583251953
10934/28840	Yes said Dantès do you know him   No replied Villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspir	14.674561500549316

10936/28840	I have however already told you sir I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the	36.49985885620117
10937/28840	Yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said Ville	22.733381271362305
10938/28840	I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give	88.59193420410156
10939/28840	Have you shown this letter to anyone asked Villefort becoming still more	88.13585662841797
10940/28840	Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba and addressed to	23.46470832824707
10941/28840	Noirtier   Everybody except the person who gave it to	35.05821990966797
10942/28840	And that was too much far too much murmured Ville	52.45916748046875
10943/28840	Villeforts brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dantès with	53.212608337402344
10944/28840	After reading the letter Villefort covered his face with his	33.33393096923828
10945/28840	Oh said Dantès timidly what is the matter Villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the	27.614776611328125
10946/28840	It is for me to give orders here and not	100.55946350097656

10949/28840	Dantès waited expecting a question but in	46.4592399597168
10950/28840	Villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the	19.94108772277832
10951/28840	Oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort I am lost And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his	35.4130973815918
10952/28840	Oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he	77.86392974853516
10953/28840	In heavens name cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me I will answer	85.56631469726562

10956/28840	The principal charge against you is this letter and you see Villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely	113.65978240966797
10957/28840	You see I destroy it   Oh exclaimed Dantès you are goodness	43.82127380371094
10958/28840	Listen continued Villefort you can now have confidence in me after what I have	48.5236930847168
10959/28840	Listen this is not a command but advice I give	162.1174774169922

10962/28840	Should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this	45.3250846862793
10963/28840	It was Villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured	41.32556915283203
10964/28840	You see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and I alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of itdeny it boldly and you are	132.10479736328125
10965/28840	It was the only letter you had   It	69.5597152709961
10966/28840	Villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his	51.53793716430664
10967/28840	Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself halffainting into a	46.1168212890625
10968/28840	Alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at Marseilles I should have been	55.995826721191406

10970/28840	Oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes Suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in	97.09971618652344
10971/28840	This will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me I will make my	73.64212799072266
10972/28840	Now to the work I have in	281.4610595703125
10973/28840	And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrot	26.62469482421875
10974/28840	The Château dIf   The commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on Dantès right and the other on his	15.2354097366333
10975/28840	A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest	69.0018081665039
10976/28840	The Palais de Justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clocktower of the Accou	52.63468551635742
10977/28840	After numberless windings Dantès saw a door with an iron w	53.34030532836914
10978/28840	The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his	60.87263488769531
10979/28840	The door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind	40.10670852661133
10980/28840	The air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in	211.61322021484375
10981/28840	He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of Villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of	76.95018768310547
10982/28840	It was four oclock when Dantès was placed in this	23.061243057250977
10983/28840	It was as we have said the 1st of March and the prisoner was soon buried in	55.84053421020508
10984/28840	The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and Dantès sank again into his	50.89527893066406
10985/28840	By the torchlight Dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarm	46.32288360595703
10986/28840	He had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of	83.66324615478516
10987/28840	Are you come to fetch me asked	29.835281372070312
10988/28840	By the orders of the deputy procureur   I believe	25.7688045501709
10989/28840	The conviction that they came from	101.89791107177734
10990/28840	de Villefort relieved all Dantès apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the	35.05908966064453
10991/28840	A carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside	43.00373840332031

10996/28840	Soon he saw the lights of La Cons	89.8293685913086
10997/28840	The carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order Dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the qu	49.56353759765625
10998/28840	Can all this force be summoned on my account thought	153.71554565429688
10999/28840	The officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered Dantès question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the	50.87302017211914
11000/28840	The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his	42.89674758911133

11004/28840	At a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as Dantès knew in the Frioul and outside the inner	89.03863525390625

11010/28840	Dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained	62.58347702026367

11016/28840	How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her   One light alone was visible and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès	30.314924240112305

11024/28840	In spite of his repugnance to address the guards Dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand   Comrade said he I adjure you as a Christian and a soldier to tell me where we are	26.325916290283203

11032/28840	This gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to Dantès like a scaffold to a malef	52.36012649536133

11042/28840	And he levelled his carbine at Dantès who felt the muzzle against his	47.916839599609375
11043/28840	For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken	133.841796875

11059/28840	Dantès was alone in darkness and in silencecold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning	44.348236083984375
11060/28840	With the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave Dantès where he	38.037750244140625
11061/28840	He found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with	87.79052734375
11062/28840	He had passed the night standing and without	149.510498046875
11063/28840	The jailer advanced Dantès appeared not to perceive	50.78630065917969

11065/28840	Do you wish for anything   I wish to see the	25.64039421081543
11066/28840	The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the	38.74036407470703
11067/28840	Dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door	16.28223419189453
11068/28840	All his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus	107.40079498291016
11069/28840	The day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its	106.39363861083984
11070/28840	He had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome	186.739013671875
11071/28840	The thought was maddening and Dantès threw himself furiously down on his	36.87532043457031
11072/28840	The next morning at the same hour the jailer came	44.26674270629883
11073/28840	Well said the jailer are you more reasonable today Dantès made no	39.79176712036133
11074/28840	Come cheer up is there anything that I can do for you   I wish to see the	35.768959045410156
11075/28840	I have already told you it was	16.01236343383789
11076/28840	Why so   Because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for	84.8374252319336
11077/28840	What is allowed then   Better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk	100.47625732421875
11078/28840	I do not want books I am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but I wish to see the	47.08112716674805

11080/28840	Well then said Edmond if you do not I shall die of hungerthat is	38.30469512939453
11081/28840	The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued	89.71635437011719
11082/28840	What you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his	49.15650939941406

11086/28840	You think so   Yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before	74.4476547241211

11091/28840	Well said Dantès mark this if you refuse at least to tell Mercédès I am here I will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter I will dash out your brains with this	42.327919006347656
11092/28840	Threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going	159.13299560546875
11093/28840	The abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons	95.55248260498047
11094/28840	Dantès whirled the stool round his	27.9769344329834
11095/28840	All right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it	82.36707305908203

11097/28840	Very well returned Dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality	53.97948455810547
11098/28840	The jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four	50.022823333740234

11101/28840	Yes we must put the madman with the mad	100.87720489501953
11102/28840	The soldiers seized Dantès who followed	56.310546875
11103/28840	He descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust	55.123985290527344
11104/28840	The door closed and Dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the	37.6544075012207
11105/28840	The jailer was right Dantès wanted but little of being utterly	75.17290496826172

11111/28840	Will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation   Ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on Villeforts	81.67567443847656
11112/28840	So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days so added he turning to Renée judge for yourself if it be not	62.64056396484375
11113/28840	You are going to leave us cried Renée unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected	54.921409606933594

11119/28840	Well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is   An affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in	60.709693908691406
11120/28840	Now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property   All my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand franc	49.829681396484375

11123/28840	Then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay perhaps even now I shall arrive too	84.8382339477539
11124/28840	The deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then   And sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market	45.142608642578125
11125/28840	Now then said Villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook I must have another   To whom   To the	30.827531814575195

11129/28840	But address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the Tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or	57.23427963256836
11130/28840	Doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with	112.66282653808594
11131/28840	The keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to	99.58160400390625
11132/28840	I tell you marquis my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service I do	50.42240905761719

11141/28840	I shall be gone only a few	77.50527954101562
11142/28840	Villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary	62.86710739135742
11143/28840	At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for	44.06623840332031
11144/28840	It was Mercédès who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after	28.22198486328125
11145/28840	As Villefort drew near she advanced and stood before	31.83625030517578
11146/28840	Dantès had spoken of Mercédès and Villefort instantly recognized	11.17349624633789
11147/28840	Her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the	85.62835693359375
11148/28840	The young man you speak of said Villefort abruptly is a great criminal and I can do nothing for him mademois	26.76274871826172
11149/28840	Mercédès burst into tears and as Villefort strove to pass her again addressed	19.770647048950195
11150/28840	But at least tell me where he is that I may know whether he is alive or dead said	51.103607177734375

11152/28840	And desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he	63.585304260253906
11153/28840	But remorse is not thus banished like Virgils wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a	88.33014678955078
11154/28840	Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his	161.6772918701172
11155/28840	In this case he was not the judge but the execution	54.79208755493164

11312/28840	To fall continued King Louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspendedto fall and learn of that fall by telegraph Oh I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother Louis	162.93142700195312
11313/28840	than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by	72.33731842041016
11314/28840	Ridicule sirwhy you know not its power in France and yet you ought to know it   Sire sire murmured the minister for pitys   Approach	57.3709831237793
11315/28840	de Villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a	57.41263198852539
11316/28840	Approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not	53.157867431640625
11317/28840	Sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the	122.24736022949219
11318/28840	Really impossible Yesthat is a great word	133.91578674316406
11319/28840	Unfortunately there are great words as there are great men I have measured	130.27859497070312
11320/28840	The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort who bent his head in modest	106.90961456298828
11321/28840	I do not mean that for you Blacas continued Louis XV	33.629276275634766
11322/28840	for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your	46.82190704345703
11323/28840	Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of	130.78530883789062
11324/28840	de Villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal	197.33392333984375
11325/28840	These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour	65.01925659179688
11326/28840	Any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably	65.62055206298828
11327/28840	In fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth Napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villeforts	64.57012176513672
11328/28840	Realizing this Villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead of aiding to crush	88.56210327148438
11329/28840	Do not attribute to me more than I deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of	61.15040969848633
11330/28840	And now gentlemen he continued turning towards	234.69129943847656
11331/28840	de Blacas and the minister of police I have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of	54.26051712036133
11332/28840	de Blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and	122.97848510742188
11333/28840	Do not mention reports duke to me for I know now what confidence to place in	243.59878540039062
11334/28840	Yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue SaintJacques   The affair in the Rue SaintJacques exclaimed Villefort unable to repress an ex	25.456342697143555
11335/28840	Then suddenly pausing he added Your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect I have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of	57.614036560058594
11336/28840	Go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries	123.34976196289062
11337/28840	On the contrary siron the contrary said Louis XV	76.81966400146484
11338/28840	this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of General Quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal	51.958988189697266
11339/28840	At the name of General Quesnel Villefort tremb	14.81777572631836
11340/28840	Everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of	95.0550537109375
11341/28840	General Quesnel it appears had just left a Bonapartist club when he	45.3370475769043
11342/28840	An unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the Rue SaintJacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the	66.46241760253906
11343/28840	As the police minister related this to the king Villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and	94.1229019165039
11344/28840	Do you not think with me	134.2906951904297
11345/28840	de Villefort that General Quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush   It is probable sire replied Ville	22.176671981811523
11346/28840	But is this all that is known   They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with	47.78126907348633
11347/28840	Yes the servant has given his	201.13043212890625
11348/28840	He is a man of from fifty to fiftytwo years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moust	48.072601318359375
11349/28840	He was dressed in a blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his buttonhole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of	15.030900001525879
11350/28840	Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue CoqHé	30.29109001159668
11351/28840	Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed	50.18177795410156
11352/28840	It required all Villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired	71.60916137695312
11353/28840	How strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say A murder has been committed and especially so when they can add And we are on the track of the guilty	147.4281463623047
11354/28840	Sire your majesty will I trust be amply satisfied on this point at	158.54653930664062
11355/28840	I will no longer detain you	34.11387252807617
11356/28840	de Villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and	76.78484344482422
11357/28840	Of course you stopped at your fathers A feeling of faintness came over Ville	168.51715087890625
11358/28840	0145m       No sire he replied I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid in the Rue de Tourn	15.967174530029297
11359/28840	But you have seen him   Sire I went straight to the Duc de Bl	15.438186645507812
11360/28840	But you will see him then   I think not s	25.793901443481445
11361/28840	Ah I forgot said Louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive I forgot you and	78.00150299072266
11362/28840	Noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recomp	77.24553680419922
11363/28840	Sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask	72.72055053710938
11364/28840	Never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind	140.26312255859375
11365/28840	In the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of	54.551673889160156
11366/28840	Louis above the order of NotreDameduMontCarmel and	148.60789489746094
11367/28840	Lazare and gave it to Villefortin the meanwhile take this	85.51141357421875
11368/28840	Sire said Villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers	119.21727752685547
11369/28840	take it such as it is for I have not the time to procure you	42.66347122192383
11370/28840	Blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to	84.75110626220703
11371/28840	Villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed	48.855743408203125
11372/28840	Sire replied Villefort bowing in an hour I shall have quitted	31.405681610107422
11373/28840	Go sir said the king and should I forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my	88.6004638671875
11374/28840	Baron send for the minister of	277.913330078125
11375/28840	Ah sir said the minister of police to Villefort as they left the Tuileries you entered by lucks dooryour fortune is	57.761173248291016
11376/28840	Will it be long first muttered Villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackneyco	56.689884185791016
11377/28840	One passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of	98.24251556396484
11378/28840	Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to	79.44173431396484
11379/28840	He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and	53.580230712890625
11380/28840	The valet opened the door and Villefort heard someone speak his	72.0703125
11381/28840	0147m       Who could know that I was here already said the young	14.788002967834473
11382/28840	Well said Villefort what is itWho rangWho asked for me   A stranger who will not send in his	37.883209228515625
11383/28840	A stranger who will not send in his name What can he want with me   He wishes to speak to	30.340961456298828
11384/28840	Did he mention my name  	81.10946655273438
11385/28840	What sort of person is he   Why sir a man of about	55.46006393432617
11386/28840	Short or tall   About your own height	184.6344757080078
11387/28840	Dark or fair   Darkvery dark with black eyes black hair black	86.31941223144531
11388/28840	In a blue frockcoat buttoned up close decorated with the Legion of	16.03188705444336
11389/28840	It is he said Villefort turning	21.94259262084961
11390/28840	Well then if you felt so sure replied the newcomer putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair allow me to say my dear Gérard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the	45.11135482788086
11391/28840	The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of aston	79.10078430175781
11392/28840	Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to Villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not	33.77047348022461
11393/28840	Noirtier seating himself I might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of February and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in	42.871063232421875
11394/28840	And if I have come my dear father said Gérard drawing closer to	60.69840621948242
11395/28840	Noirtier do not complain for it is for you that I came and my journey will be your	46.88037109375
11396/28840	Noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the	37.46656036376953
11397/28840	Really pray tell me all about it for it must be	57.490623474121094
11398/28840	Father you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue SaintJacques  	17.048809051513672
11399/28840	Why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from Paris in a haycart been hunted over the plains of Bordeaux by Robespierres bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most	71.0320816040039
11400/28840	0151m       And who told you this fine story   The king	18.61603546142578
11401/28840	Well then in return for your story continued Noirtier I will tell you	43.47148513793945
11402/28840	My dear father I think I already know what you are about to tell	33.18116760253906
11403/28840	Ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor   Not so loud father I entreat of youfor your own sake as well as	44.87602996826172
11404/28840	Yes I heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible speed halfdesperate at the enforced	110.18327331542969
11405/28840	Why three days ago the emperor had not	71.47063446044922
11406/28840	No matter I was aware of his	87.99694061279297
11407/28840	How did you know about it   By a letter addressed to you from the Island of El	16.04596710205078
11408/28840	To me   To you and which I discovered in the pocketbook of the	42.7398567199707
11409/28840	Had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been	107.81575012207031
11410/28840	Come come said he will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly Shot my dear boy What an idea Where is the letter you speak of I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass	72.67724609375
11411/28840	I burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your	158.26026916503906
11412/28840	And the destruction of your future prospects replied Noirtier yes I can easily comprehend	59.9568977355957
11413/28840	But I have nothing to fear while I have you to protect	44.863407135009766
11414/28840	I do better than that sirI save	69.22172546386719
11415/28840	You do Why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain	91.5372543334961
11416/28840	I must refer again to the club in the Rue SaintJac	23.856943130493164
11417/28840	It appears that this club is rather a bore to the	273.9450378417969
11418/28840	Why didnt they search more vigilantly they would have found   They have not found but they are on the	109.55126190185547
11419/28840	Yes that the usual phrase I am quite familiar with	63.03370666503906
11420/28840	When the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is	81.2086181640625
11421/28840	Yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a	102.34991455078125
11422/28840	A murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was	103.08907318115234
11423/28840	People are found every day in the Seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to	161.49098205566406
11424/28840	Father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of	54.12797546386719
11425/28840	No no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the	122.33313751220703
11426/28840	And who thus designated it   The king	125.81842803955078
11427/28840	The king I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in	90.53809356689453
11428/28840	In politics my dear fellow you know as well as I do there are no men but ideasno feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is	84.69425964355469
11429/28840	Would you like to know how matters have progressed Well I will tell	71.75586700439453
11430/28840	It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba one of us went to him and invited him to the Rue SaintJacques where he would find some	35.617305755615234
11431/28840	He came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba the projected landing	112.8165283203125
11432/28840	When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royal	59.1947021484375
11433/28840	Then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeperfectly	89.79133605957031
11434/28840	What could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way thats	158.30992126464844
11435/28840	A murder really Villefort you surprise	211.4745330810547
11436/28840	But father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be	323.6952209472656
11437/28840	You rely on the usurpers return   We	64.4012451171875
11438/28840	You are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of France without being followed tracked and caught like a wild	83.3210220336914
11439/28840	My dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons and on the 20th or 25th at	50.99704360961914
11440/28840	He has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against	81.82914733886719
11441/28840	Yes to escort him into the	97.8616943359375
11442/28840	Really my dear Gérard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing The usurper has landed at Cannes with several	68.6827392578125
11443/28840	But where is he what is he doing You do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to Paris without drawing a	65.34181213378906
11444/28840	Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable	143.5452117919922
11445/28840	Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall Lyons will hasten to welcome	209.26846313476562
11446/28840	Believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your	74.00526428222656
11447/28840	Would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet I knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the	72.10283660888672
11448/28840	You gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet I have your address and in proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at	71.71485900878906
11449/28840	Ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine	75.48774719238281
11450/28840	Indeed replied Villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well	44.288848876953125
11451/28840	You who are in power have only the means that money produceswe who are in expectation have those which devotion	177.38470458984375
11452/28840	Yes devotion for that is I believe the phrase for hopeful	138.864990234375
11453/28840	And Villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant whom his son had not	50.149356842041016
11454/28840	Wait my dear father said the young man one word	39.530303955078125
11455/28840	However stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible	292.9092712402344
11456/28840	What is that   The description of the man who on the morning of the day when General Quesnel disappeared presented himself at his	25.363441467285156
11457/28840	Ah ha thats it is it said Noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him   Because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the Rue CoqHé	30.70557403564453
11458/28840	Didnt I say that your police were good for nothing   Yes but they may catch him	74.01762390136719
11459/28840	True said Noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile He will consequently make a few changes in his personal	76.9193344116211

11465/28840	Yes yes and now I believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured I will return the favor	57.509376525878906

11481/28840	Villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the Legion of Honor which he had the prudence not to wear although	54.75497055053711

11514/28840	What can they have done with him   Oh he has been taken to Fenestrelles to Pignerol or to the SainteMarguérite	49.85618209838867
11515/28840	Some fine morning he will return to take command of your	137.2095489501953

11523/28840	Had Morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled	122.27043914794922
11524/28840	de Villefort how would you advise me to act asked	34.48915100097656
11525/28840	Oh I know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read	74.599609375
11526/28840	That is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by	84.08610534667969
11527/28840	And will you undertake to deliver it   With the greatest	59.702392578125
11528/28840	Dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn	47.09336471557617
11529/28840	Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defence	96.6025619506836
11530/28840	But how shall I address the minister   Sit down there said Villefort giving up his place to Morrel and write what I	37.60699462890625
11531/28840	Will you be so good  	96.4111328125
11532/28840	But lose no time we have lost too much	128.2340545654297
11533/28840	Only think what the poor fellow may even now be	175.3013916015625
11534/28840	Villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw	23.071590423583984
11535/28840	Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villeforts	31.92438316345215
11536/28840	Villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt Dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of Napoleons	53.69733810424805
11537/28840	It was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release	60.16775131225586
11538/28840	The petition finished Villefort read it	174.84925842285156
11539/28840	That will do said he leave the rest to	105.61360168457031
11540/28840	Will the petition go soon  	986.732177734375
11541/28840	Countersigned by you   The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your	88.4261474609375
11542/28840	And sitting down Villefort wrote the certificate at the	65.48164367675781
11543/28840	What more is to be done   I will do whatever is	36.87810134887695
11544/28840	This assurance delighted Morrel who took leave of Villefort and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he would soon see his	32.633323669433594
11545/28840	As for Villefort instead of sending to Paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second	51.315513610839844
11546/28840	Dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XV	26.74510955810547
11547/28840	s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the	213.48098754882812
11548/28840	Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand and twice had Villefort soothed him with	163.42825317382812
11549/28840	At last there was Waterloo and Morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself useless	82.87777709960938
11550/28840	And so Dantès after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and	98.4732666015625
11551/28840	Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantès and when Napoleon returned to France he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence _a decree of Providence	63.68048858642578
11552/28840	But when Napoleon returned to Paris Danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of Dantès return on a mission of	50.279541015625

11554/28840	He then left for Madrid and was no more heard	172.28628540039062
11555/28840	Fernand understood nothing except that Dantès was	29.277111053466797
11556/28840	What had become of him he cared not to	42.93992614746094
11557/28840	Fernands mind was made up he would shoot Dantès and then kill	103.82521057128906

11559/28840	During this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the	135.020751953125
11560/28840	Fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercédè	87.52498626708984
11561/28840	Had Fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from Mercédè	38.56581115722656
11562/28840	His devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsMercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand and this was now strengthened by	75.10633087158203
11563/28840	My brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed I shall be alone in the	64.30550384521484
11564/28840	These words carried a ray of hope into Fernands	176.97715759277344

11569/28840	It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved	211.03260803222656

11579/28840	He inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to	61.585716247558594
11580/28840	The universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set	79.84337615966797

11582/28840	What could they desire beyond their liberty The inspector turned smilingly to the	259.7925720214844
11583/28840	I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits when you see one prisoner you see allalways the same thingill fed and	173.26956176757812

11612/28840	Seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded Dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped	82.57254791259766
11613/28840	The soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three	45.26953125
11614/28840	Dantès saw that he was looked upon as	25.138566970825195
11615/28840	Then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with	125.19686126708984
11616/28840	The inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed He will become religioushe is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonetsmadmen are not afraid of anything I made some curious observations on this at Charent	100.36808013916016
11617/28840	Then turning to the prisoner What is it you want said	42.59750747680664
11618/28840	I want to know what crime I have committedto be tried and if I am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at	75.76201629638672

11620/28840	I believe so I dont know its of no	124.20865631103516
11621/28840	What matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his execution	90.98503112792969
11622/28840	You are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turn	74.16806030273438
11623/28840	It is true sir and I beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but I was	44.00267791748047
11624/28840	And you are not so any longer   No captivity has subdued meI have been here so	70.4401626586914
11625/28840	So longwhen were you arrested then asked the	95.97555541992188

11628/28840	You must show me the proofs against	156.99745178222656
11629/28840	Certainly but you will find terrible	119.09268188476562
11630/28840	Monsieur continued Dantès I know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meyou can have me triedand that is all I	34.15847396850586
11631/28840	Let me know my crime and the reason why I was	119.53986358642578
11632/28840	Go on with the lights said the	136.74554443359375
11633/28840	Monsieur cried Dantès I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to	53.47040557861328
11634/28840	I cannot tell you that replied the inspector I can only promise to examine into your	54.81800842285156
11635/28840	Oh I am freethen I am saved   Who arrested you  	49.67014694213867
11636/28840	See him and hear what he	98.5831527709961
11637/28840	Villefort is no longer at Marseilles he is now at Toul	28.684486389160156
11638/28840	I am no longer surprised at my detention murmured Dantès since my only protector is	41.38017654418945
11639/28840	de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you   None on the contrary he was very kind to	33.63163375854492
11640/28840	I can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you   Entire	63.00404357910156
11641/28840	Dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnest	18.349790573120117
11642/28840	The door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès	50.351844787597656
11643/28840	0173m       Will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell   Let us visit them all said the	31.89246940612793
11644/28840	If I once went up those	309.7446594238281
11645/28840	I should never have the courage to come down	40.892730712890625
11646/28840	Ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of	112.63919830322266
11647/28840	What is his folly   He fancies he possesses an immense	83.66512298583984
11648/28840	The first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on	217.21229553222656
11649/28840	He is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five	106.01453399658203
11650/28840	How curiouswhat is his name   The Abbé Far	23.000999450683594
11651/28840	It is here unlock the door Ant	56.66990661621094
11652/28840	The turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the _mad abbé_ as the prisoner was usually	51.50641632080078
11653/28840	In the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered	55.8126106262207
11654/28840	He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew	100.30287170410156
11655/28840	He did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons	46.24171829223633
11656/28840	He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round	103.70487213134766
11657/28840	What is it you want said the	38.016456604003906
11658/28840	I monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surpriseI want	12.468729972839355
11659/28840	You do not understand continued the inspector I am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the	64.40438079833984
11660/28840	Oh that is different cried the abbé and we shall understand each other I	29.392616271972656
11661/28840	There now whispered the governor it is just as I told	44.291770935058594
11662/28840	Monsieur continued the prisoner I am the Abbé Faria born at	29.180713653564453
11663/28840	I was for twenty years Cardinal Spadas secretary I was arrested why I know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French	65.98764038085938
11664/28840	Why from the French government   Because I was arrested at Piombino and I presume that like Milan and Florence Piombino has become the capital of some French	45.57697677612305
11665/28840	Monsieur returned the inspector Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warm	107.00621032714844
11666/28840	It is the only means of rendering Italy strong happy and	266.5920715332031
11667/28840	Very possibly only I am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain	63.266353607177734
11668/28840	We are coming to the point whispered the	116.617431640625
11669/28840	It is for that reason I am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change Newtons	44.55446243286133
11670/28840	Could you allow me a few words in	83.25239562988281
11671/28840	What did I tell you said the	30.03709602355957
11672/28840	You knew him returned the inspector with a	50.499053955078125
11673/28840	What you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing Far	47.899417877197266
11674/28840	0175m       But said the abbé I would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five	16.778005599975586
11675/28840	The very sum you named whispered the inspector in his	158.95523071289062
11676/28840	However continued Faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be	45.911888122558594
11677/28840	Unfortunately said the governor I know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his	46.47179412841797
11678/28840	Of course said he of what else should I speak  	79.70407104492188
11679/28840	Inspector continued the governor I can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five	48.377864837646484
11680/28840	That proves returned the abbé that you are like those of Holy Writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear	112.50634765625
11681/28840	My dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are	132.91000366210938
11682/28840	The abbés eyes glistened he seized the inspectors	58.38427734375
11683/28840	But what if I am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this treasure will be	119.97283172607422
11684/28840	Had not government better profit by it I will offer six millions and I will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my	72.0648193359375
11685/28840	On my word said the inspector in a low tone had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad I should believe what he	43.5407829284668
11686/28840	I am not mad replied Faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to	103.44686126708984
11687/28840	The treasure I speak of really exists and I offer to sign an agreement with you in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if I deceive you bring me here againI ask no	70.00723266601562
11688/28840	Is the spot far from here   A hundred	64.98181915283203
11689/28840	It is not illplanned said the	59.715206146240234
11690/28840	If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of	78.45281982421875
11691/28840	The scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbés plan has not even the merit of original	48.585960388183594
11692/28840	Then turning to Faria I inquired if you are well fed said	51.18251037597656
11693/28840	Swear to me replied Faria to free me if what I tell you prove true and I will stay here while you go to the	77.59407043457031
11694/28840	Are you well fed repeated the	100.46538543701172
11695/28840	Monsieur you run no risk for as I told you I will stay here so there is no chance of my	49.8519401550293
11696/28840	You do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatient	59.24394607543945
11697/28840	Nor you to mine cried the abb	43.95625686645508
11698/28840	You will not accept my gold I will keep it for	48.438262939453125
11699/28840	You refuse me my liberty God will give it	235.71188354492188
11700/28840	And the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his	88.57237243652344
11701/28840	0177m       What is he doing there said the	16.15380859375
11702/28840	Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound	50.77080154418945
11703/28840	The turnkey closed the door behind	104.5799560546875
11704/28840	He was wealthy once perhaps said the	351.76849365234375
11705/28840	Or dreamed he was and awoke	761.6695556640625
11706/28840	After all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been	37.57770538330078
11707/28840	So the matter ended for the Abbé Far	19.713661193847656
11708/28840	He remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his	130.75680541992188
11709/28840	Caligula or Nero those treasureseekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed	89.91893768310547
11710/28840	But the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor	207.756591796875
11711/28840	They fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their	188.10816955566406
11712/28840	Formerly they believed themselves sprung from Jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviol	118.01571655273438
11713/28840	It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reapp	55.09281921386719
11714/28840	The very madness of the Abbé Faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual	87.00812530517578
11715/28840	The inspector kept his word with Dantès he examined the register and found the following note concerning him   _Edmond Dantès_   Violent Bonapartist took an active part in the return from El	38.80398178100586
11716/28840	The greatest watchfulness and care to be	259.2368469238281
11717/28840	This note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his	94.24250030517578
11718/28840	The inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote _Nothing to be	139.27906799316406
11719/28840	Days and weeks passed away then monthsDantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in a	146.60528564453125
11720/28840	This fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six	119.30616760253906
11721/28840	Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and Dantès began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the	76.53451538085938
11722/28840	At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at	106.74334716796875
11723/28840	He took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them Dantès jail	51.345458984375
11724/28840	A new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers	107.93869018554688
11725/28840	This horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantèshe was now number	62.383792877197266
11726/28840	Number 34 and Number 27   Dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in	86.75904846191406

11728/28840	Dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some	113.74349212646484
11729/28840	He entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing	190.30902099609375
11730/28840	His requests were not granted but he went on asking all the	133.7172088623047
11731/28840	He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was	113.69631958007812
11732/28840	Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified	37.06852340698242
11733/28840	Often before his captivity Dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and	62.40456008911133
11734/28840	He now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the	64.28962707519531
11735/28840	The galleyslaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each	49.692283630371094
11736/28840	He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abb	105.07211303710938
11737/28840	The jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a	121.10801696777344
11738/28840	Dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to	61.37397003173828
11739/28840	He laid every action of his life before the Almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against	72.08712005615234
11740/28840	Yet in spite of his earnest prayers Dantès remained a	43.049068450927734
11741/28840	He could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so	201.98399353027344
11742/28840	Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness No distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a	163.8828125
11743/28840	Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene mene tekel upharsin_ of Belshazz	77.82376861572266
11744/28840	He told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of Heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest	69.4455795288086
11745/28840	He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconscious	108.4677963256836
11746/28840	By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on	218.8225860595703

11748/28840	This state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will	117.02334594726562
11749/28840	There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and	69.64411926269531
11750/28840	Edmond found some solace in these	197.23899841308594
11751/28840	All his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to	98.60543823242188
11752/28840	Dantès reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a	92.38597869873047
11753/28840	Sometimes said he in my voyages when I was a man and commanded other men I have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its	84.4521713256836
11754/28840	Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the temp	150.46026611328125
11755/28840	Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of	86.61351013183594
11756/28840	No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a wornout	134.13600158691406
11757/28840	Two methods of selfdestruction were at his	70.96961212158203

11759/28840	But the first was repugnant to	42.54299545288086
11760/28840	Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yardarm he would not die by what seemed an infamous	73.30792236328125

11763/28840	Dantès said I wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to	46.14973068237305
11764/28840	When my morning and evening meals are brought thought he I will cast them out of the window and they will think that I have eaten	133.51556396484375
11765/28840	He kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with	163.2461395263672
11766/28840	Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to	78.90740966796875
11767/28840	Hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy	111.99588012695312
11768/28840	It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less	148.79345703125

11770/28840	What unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty Then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary Tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break	94.32715606689453
11771/28840	He persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the	84.66171264648438
11772/28840	The next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously	71.50178527832031
11773/28840	It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death   Suddenly about nine oclock in the evening Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was	53.26344299316406
11774/28840	So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual Edmond raised his head and	102.79097747802734
11775/28840	It was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the	97.64900207519531
11776/28840	Although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the	81.46229553222656
11777/28840	Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated	89.16095733642578
11778/28840	No no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death   Edmond still heard the	46.01665496826172
11779/28840	It lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was	165.38087463378906
11780/28840	Some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more	330.1745910644531
11781/28840	Fortunately he fancied that Dantès was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he	53.00117492675781
11782/28840	Edmond listened and the sound became more and more	64.47521209716797
11783/28840	There can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his	88.0495834350586
11784/28840	Oh if I were only there to help him   Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring	73.4699478149414
11785/28840	He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his	76.36030578613281
11786/28840	He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable	47.138465881347656
11787/28840	He had the resolution to stop with	113.144775390625
11788/28840	He had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much	151.37823486328125
11789/28840	Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchhe did not wish to	67.24040985107422
11790/28840	He soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by	245.3672637939453
11791/28840	Then he said to himself   I must put this to the test but without compromising	60.596092224121094
11792/28840	If it is a workman I need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume	49.56254577636719
11793/28840	If on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise I make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is	101.61430358886719
11794/28840	Edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound	67.09970092773438
11795/28840	At the first blow the sound ceased as if by	83.11935424804688
11796/28840	Edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wallall was silent	114.46714782714844
11797/28840	Full of hope Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh	64.39676666259766
11798/28840	The day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the	227.84991455078125
11799/28840	It is a prisoner said Edmond joy	56.912845611572266
11800/28840	His brain was on fire and life and energy	352.69964599609375
11801/28840	At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as	101.92847442626953
11802/28840	He moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and	79.98719024658203
11803/28840	Something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a ch	49.33987808227539
11804/28840	Encouraged by this discovery Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable lab	102.91378784179688
11805/28840	He began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a	88.06116485595703
11806/28840	He saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solid	111.43069458007812
11807/28840	All his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a	183.1499481201172
11808/28840	The bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screwdriver to take them	92.43123626708984
11809/28840	The table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been	222.631103515625
11810/28840	0189m       Dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the	28.83912467956543
11811/28840	He let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in	132.8539276123047
11812/28840	Dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the	41.22624969482422
11813/28840	The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite	101.5168685913086
11814/28840	Edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for	78.59565734863281
11815/28840	All night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his	128.4452362060547
11816/28840	Dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken	40.40364456176758
11817/28840	He returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and	229.81671142578125
11818/28840	The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despond	173.32955932617188
11819/28840	During the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished   This idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the ston	108.45741271972656
11820/28840	The wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbed	231.60693359375
11821/28840	It was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its	76.24188232421875
11822/28840	Dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too	36.43016815185547
11823/28840	The fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil Dantès paused with anguish on his	59.320892333984375
11824/28840	Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task Suddenly an idea occurred to himhe smiled and the perspiration dried on his	109.94390869140625
11825/28840	The handle of this saucepan was of iron Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for	33.9781608581543
11826/28840	0191m       The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dantès plate and Dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every	29.277048110961914
11827/28840	Now when evening came Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke	58.25693893432617
11828/28840	This time he could not blame Dantè	25.572233200073242
11829/28840	He was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before	47.60669708251953
11830/28840	Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into Dantès entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no	119.24172973632812
11831/28840	Leave the saucepan said Dantès you can take it away when you bring me my	34.39408874511719
11832/28840	This advice was to the jailers taste as it spared him the necessity of making another	115.1405258178711
11833/28840	A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went	90.62063598632812
11834/28840	At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in	51.13325881958008
11835/28840	Dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with	40.554344177246094
11836/28840	Then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ce	63.90375900268555
11837/28840	At the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay	62.016788482666016
11838/28840	The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the	62.34676742553711
11839/28840	Well dont you intend to bring me another plate said Dantè	37.102325439453125
11840/28840	No replied the turnkey you destroy	197.05935668945312
11841/28840	First you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be	196.85171508789062
11842/28840	I shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into	87.9601058959961
11843/28840	So for the future I hope you will not be so	35.5350227355957
11844/28840	Dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the cover	13.618831634521484
11845/28840	He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for	94.03443908691406
11846/28840	He had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his	79.65058135986328
11847/28840	All day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of	78.44764709472656
11848/28840	When the hour for his jailers visit arrived Dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed	53.101463317871094
11849/28840	The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of	182.78091430664062
11850/28840	This would have been a method of reckoning time had not Dantès long ceased to do	49.79180908203125
11851/28840	Having poured out the soup the turnkey	152.4705352783203
11852/28840	Dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to	37.546180725097656
11853/28840	He listenedall was silent as it had been for the last three	44.281494140625
11854/28840	Dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted	22.15853500366211
11855/28840	However he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an	71.18782043457031
11856/28840	The iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface Dantès touched it and found that it was a	64.89326477050781
11857/28840	This beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole Dantès had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under	109.22093200683594
11858/28840	The unhappy young man had not thought of	50.39631271362305

11860/28840	Edmonds hair stood on end and he rose to his	70.1246337890625
11861/28840	Ah said he I hear a human	101.69943237304688
11862/28840	Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisonerhe is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and	145.5441131591797
11863/28840	In the name of Heaven cried Dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies	38.02740478515625
11864/28840	Who are you   Who are you said the	25.909589767456055
11865/28840	An unhappy prisoner replied Dantès who made no hesitation in	76.50857543945312
11866/28840	Of what country   A	84.27488708496094

11872/28840	Dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in	29.651029586791992
11873/28840	Do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation   On a level with the	130.20599365234375
11874/28840	How is it concealed   Behind my	143.0060272216797

11877/28840	And the corridor   On a	129.33343505859375
11878/28840	Oh what is the matter cried Dantè	9.421646118164062
11879/28840	I have made a mistake owing to an error in my	68.10163116455078
11880/28840	I took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where I	155.89004516601562
11881/28840	I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the	59.249454498291016

11888/28840	Oh I am a Christian cried Dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon	42.37660217285156
11889/28840	I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but I conjure you do not abandon	39.65166091918945
11890/28840	If you do I swear to you for I have got to the end of my strength that I will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself	32.835418701171875
11891/28840	How old are you Your voice is that of a young	130.30567932128906
11892/28840	I do not know my age for I have not counted the years I have been	37.00905990600586
11893/28840	All I do know is that I was just nineteen when I was arrested the 28th of February 18	41.17714309692383
11894/28840	Not quite twentysix murmured the voice at that age he cannot be a	79.01144409179688
11895/28840	I swear to you again rather than betray you I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces   You have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for I was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures	47.235172271728516

11903/28840	It is well returned the voice	360.9428405761719
11904/28840	These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity Dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the	55.340763092041016
11905/28840	He then gave himself up to his	119.42068481445312

11908/28840	All day Dantès walked up and down his	33.57117462158203
11909/28840	He sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his	47.43112564086914
11910/28840	At the slightest noise he bounded towards the	73.95246124267578
11911/28840	Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water	81.91320037841797
11912/28840	He would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to	64.18848419189453
11913/28840	It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished	267.8359069824219
11914/28840	Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said Come are you going mad again   Dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray	43.006874084472656
11915/28840	The jailer went away shaking his	49.71155548095703

11917/28840	The next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his	50.58927917480469
11918/28840	Is it you said he I am	68.83145904541016
11919/28840	Is your jailer gone   Yes said Dantès he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before	37.06283187866211
11920/28840	I can work then said the	146.0108184814453
11921/28840	Oh yes yes this instant I entreat	78.11186218261719
11922/28840	Then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his	58.42073059082031
11923/28840	A Learned Italian   Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired Dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the gr	54.639793395996094
11924/28840	He was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by	178.899169921875
11925/28840	He had a deepset penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his	79.63964080810547
11926/28840	His thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical	97.4627914428711
11927/28840	Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been	78.15299224853516
11928/28840	The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of	94.17498779296875
11929/28840	He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and	64.02265167236328
11930/28840	He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his	122.60631561279297

11932/28840	Advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said   You removed this stone very carelessly but I suppose you had no tools to aid	81.33316040039062
11933/28840	Why exclaimed Dantès with astonishment do you possess any   I made myself some and with the exception of a file I have all that are necessarya chisel pincers and	55.159610748291016

11937/28840	And with what did you contrive to make that inquired Dantè	36.72145462036133
11938/28840	With one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither a distance of about fifty	66.86603546142578
11939/28840	Do not speak so loud young mandont speak so	168.59776306152344
11940/28840	It frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the	128.04920959472656
11941/28840	But they believe I am shut up alone	183.70553588867188
11942/28840	I expected as I told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea I have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath	77.28282165527344
11943/28840	My labor is all in vain for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with	162.7509765625

11946/28840	As the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the	105.98253631591797
11947/28840	The young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both	38.9117546081543
11948/28840	An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying I thought so and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the	52.0471076965332
11949/28840	What was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the	45.73293685913086
11950/28840	Yes said he at length it is	29.428709030151367
11951/28840	This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and	253.37899780273438
11952/28840	Are you quite sure of that  	34.30527114868164
11953/28840	I saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for I was fearful he might also see	98.21380615234375
11954/28840	You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon   Then pursued the young man	75.59307098388672
11955/28840	Then answered the elder prisoner the will of God be done And as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn count	93.99010467529297
11956/28840	Dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with	40.0822639465332

11961/28840	Pray let me know who you really are   The stranger smiled a melancholy	67.38819122314453
11962/28840	I am the Abbé Faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this Château dIf since the year 1811 previously to which I had been confined for three years in the fortress of Fenestrel	34.84916305541992
11963/28840	In the year 1811 I was transferred to Piedmont in	48.12293243408203
11964/28840	It was at this period I learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of Rome even in his	111.32893371582031

11970/28840	Ah my friend said the abbé turning towards Dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to	36.36473846435547
11971/28840	Probably if ever I get out of prison   True replied Faria we are prisoners but I forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and I fancy myself at	75.26177978515625
11972/28840	It was the plan of Alexander	103.1989517211914
11973/28840	but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and Napoleon was unable to complete his	123.41606903076172
11974/28840	And the old man bowed his	117.02770233154297
11975/28840	Dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such	34.14607238769531

11977/28840	Are you not he asked the priest who here in the Château dIf is generally thought to beill   Mad you mean dont you   I did not like to say so answered Dantès	28.113075256347656
11978/28840	Dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said   Then you abandon all hope of escape   I perceive its utter impossibility and I consider it impious to attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not	50.63312911987305
11979/28840	In the first place I was four years making the tools I possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to	158.50193786621094
11980/28840	No I repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almightys	264.61932373046875
11981/28840	Dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbés	41.650081634521484
11982/28840	The abbé sank upon Edmonds bed while Edmond himself remained	67.58110046386719
11983/28840	Escape had never once occurred to	270.7915344238281
11984/28840	There are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an	103.60626220703125
11985/28840	But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new	114.9691390991211
11986/28840	Another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in	121.79218292236328
11987/28840	This same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an	117.50572967529297
11988/28840	And is not above fifteen feet from it   About	99.6599349975586
11989/28840	Well then I will tell you what we must	29.516592025756836
11990/28840	We must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a	105.44613647460938

11992/28840	All we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which I am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yoursyou shall now see me prove	159.04257202148438
11993/28840	One instant my dear friend replied the abbé it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed and what use I intend making of my	50.08731460571289
11994/28840	As for patience I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the	73.17203521728516
11995/28840	But then young man and I pray of you to give me your full attention then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyone who had committed no offence and merited not	109.27130889892578
11996/28840	And have your notions changed asked Dantès with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me   No neither do I wish to incur	88.3642349243164
11997/28840	Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not	184.68045043945312
11998/28840	I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but I cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a	133.7107696533203
11999/28840	A slight movement of surprise escaped Dantè	70.13229370117188
12000/28840	Because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of	78.12128448486328
12001/28840	0209m       Since my imprisonment said Faria I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on	33.575016021728516
12002/28840	Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of	151.4638671875
12003/28840	Let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by	111.88848114013672
12004/28840	Ah said Dantès you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage	110.676513671875
12005/28840	I assure you replied the old man I did not turn to that source for recreation or	42.276615142822266
12006/28840	What did you do then   I wrote or	65.40995788574219
12007/28840	Were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper   Oh no answered the abbé I had none but what I made for	39.61088180541992
12008/28840	You made paper pens and ink  	66.12509155273438

12021/28840	But the ink said Dantès of what did you make your ink   There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied Faria but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this	67.83629608154297
12022/28840	Still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday and I assure you a better ink cannot be	85.25016021728516
12023/28840	For very important notes for which closer attention is required I pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own	140.3028564453125
12024/28840	And when asked Dantès may I see all this   Whenever you please replied the abb	28.929061889648438
12025/28840	Oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young	48.74940490722656
12026/28840	Follow me then said the abbé as he reentered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by Dantè	16.2642822265625
12027/28840	The floor of the abbés cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the	35.57136154174805
12028/28840	As he entered the chamber of his friend Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his	67.31297302246094
12029/28840	It is well said the abbé we have some hours before usit is now just a quarter past twelve o	40.03010177612305
12030/28840	Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the	91.31500244140625
12031/28840	Look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbé and then observe the lines traced on the	67.47101593017578
12032/28840	This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean that it moved and not the	98.8008041381836
12033/28840	A double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly	111.60516357421875
12034/28840	Come said he to the abbé I am anxious to see your	22.909250259399414
12035/28840	0213m       What do you wish to see first asked the abb	13.506291389465332
12036/28840	Oh your great work on the monarchy of Italy   Faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of pap	69.8365249633789
12037/28840	There said he there is the work	122.83155059814453
12038/28840	I wrote the word _finis_ at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week	28.100486755371094
12039/28840	I have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of to complete the precious	69.78506469726562

12041/28840	Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your	129.98062133789062
12042/28840	Dantès examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into	56.88188934326172
12043/28840	I made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlest	63.76626968383789
12044/28840	The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and	148.8742218017578
12045/28840	As for the ink said Faria I told you how I managed to obtain thatand I only just make it from time to time as I require	63.609352111816406
12046/28840	One thing still puzzles me observed Dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight   I worked at night also replied Far	55.510833740234375

12049/28840	So saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illumin	70.34000396728516
12050/28840	But how do you procure a light   Oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt	74.8705825805664

12052/28840	Dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Farias	35.931983947753906
12053/28840	0215m       You have not seen all yet continued Faria for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding	35.76824188232422
12054/28840	Behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twentyfive and thirty feet in	107.99485778808594
12055/28840	Dantès closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any	120.67781066894531
12056/28840	And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed   Oh no for when I had taken out the thread I required I hemmed the edges over	126.04824829101562
12057/28840	With what   With this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed Dantès a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in	73.67398834228516
12058/28840	Nevertheless I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings	100.00596618652344
12059/28840	What are you thinking of asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and	46.05377197265625
12060/28840	I was reflecting in the first place replied Dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have	45.74373245239258
12061/28840	What would you not have accomplished if you had been free   Possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human	70.9485092163086

12064/28840	You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you	103.3521957397461
12065/28840	Well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now   I did   You have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the	51.62178421020508
12066/28840	It was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with	63.538021087646484
12067/28840	Your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important	168.280517578125
12068/28840	It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved	92.34687042236328

12071/28840	Come said the abbé closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your	60.723995208740234
12072/28840	From this point everything was a blank to Dantèshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been	68.91395568847656
12073/28840	His recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnest	78.90241241455078
12074/28840	Still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wicked	174.80149841308594
12075/28840	From this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way	78.91159057617188
12076/28840	Now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable   To no one by Heaven I was a very insignificant	133.40463256835938
12077/28840	Do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a	95.28704071044922

12082/28840	Now let us return to your particular	132.96128845214844
12083/28840	You say you were on the point of being made captain of the _Pharaon_  	15.336923599243164
12084/28840	And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl  	44.28824234008789
12085/28840	Now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the _Pharaon	61.97289276123047
12086/28840	What say you   I cannot believe such was the	60.884071350097656
12087/28840	I was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on	125.43116760253906
12088/28840	There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards	95.47888946533203

12092/28840	And had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment   Not if the choice had remained with me for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his	79.86975860595703
12093/28840	Good again Now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere   No we were quite	74.60601043701172
12094/28840	Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone   It might for the cabin door was openandstay now I recollectDanglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marsh	80.50125122070312
12095/28840	Thats better cried the abbé now we are on the right	68.24153900146484
12096/28840	Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba  	44.901981353759766
12097/28840	Somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it I think   Yes the grand marshal	98.2933120727539
12098/28840	And what did you do with that letter   Put it into my	41.1181526184082
12099/28840	You had your portfolio with you then Now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter   You are right it was left on	111.63997650146484
12100/28840	Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio  	59.67521286010742
12101/28840	And what did you do with this same letter while returning from PortoFerrajo to the vessel   I carried it in my	41.81392288208008
12102/28840	So that when you went on board the _Pharaon_ everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand  	26.600297927856445
12103/28840	Danglars as well as the rest   Danglars as well as	13.015490531921387
12104/28840	Now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your	173.87026977539062
12105/28840	Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated   Oh yes I read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my	81.00537872314453
12106/28840	This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon	51.48575210571289
12107/28840	The thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole	60.58496856689453
12108/28840	Do you really think so Ah that would indeed be	129.085693359375
12109/28840	How did Danglars usually write   In a handsome running	127.97339630126953
12110/28840	And how was the anonymous letter written   Back	133.1388702392578
12111/28840	It was very boldly written if	1610.723876953125
12112/28840	Stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the	64.9930648803711
12113/28840	Dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to	27.545425415039062
12114/28840	How very astonishing cried he at	412.9184265136719
12115/28840	Why your writing exactly resembles that of the	237.1965789794922
12116/28840	Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and I have noticed that   What   That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably	93.26222229003906
12117/28840	You have evidently seen and observed	218.0707550048828
12118/28840	Oh yes yes   Now as regards the second	89.63831329345703
12119/28840	Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès   Yes a young man who loved	28.73745346069336
12120/28840	And his name was  	90.74615478515625
12121/28840	That is a Spanish name I think   He was a	50.804561614990234
12122/28840	You imagine him capable of writing the letter   Oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into	74.11318969726562
12123/28840	That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice	69.88452911376953
12124/28840	Besides said Dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to	40.95655059814453
12125/28840	You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone   To no	40.53202438354492
12126/28840	Not even to your mistress   No not even to my betrot	36.3438720703125
12127/28840	I feel quite sure of it	31.812700271606445
12128/28840	Pray was Danglars acquainted with Fernand   Noyes he	54.68504333496094
12129/28840	Now I recollect   What   To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Père Pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my	54.01327896118164
12130/28840	Danglars was joking in a friendly way but Fernand looked pale and	54.35365295410156
12131/28840	Were they alone   There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named Caderousse but he was very	47.690650939941406
12132/28840	StaystayHow strange that it should not have occurred to me before Now I remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and	121.85811614990234
12133/28840	Oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed Dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brow	27.95585823059082
12134/28840	Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends inquired the abbé with a	50.570247650146484
12135/28840	The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily	205.66943359375
12136/28840	All we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs	170.30099487304688
12137/28840	If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every	63.30748748779297
12138/28840	Pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than I do	151.73690795898438
12139/28840	In the first place then who examined youthe kings attorney his deputy or a magistrate   The	131.32286071777344
12140/28840	Was he young or old   About six or sevenandtwenty years of age I should	48.16352844238281
12141/28840	Old enough to be ambitious but too young to be	130.96710205078125
12142/28840	And how did he treat you   With more of mildness than	103.90064239501953
12143/28840	Did you tell him your whole story   I	43.948001861572266
12144/28840	And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination   He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this	71.91278076171875
12145/28840	He seemed quite overcome by my	224.8759307861328
12146/28840	Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored   He gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any	67.12953186035156
12147/28840	And that   He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated	99.963623046875
12148/28840	What the accusation   No the	72.8652572631836
12149/28840	Are you sure   I saw it	61.311927795410156
12150/28840	This man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought	137.04058837890625
12151/28840	Upon my word said Dantès you make me	21.653764724731445
12152/28840	Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles   Yes and remember that twolegged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the	46.37462615966797
12153/28840	With all my heart You tell me he burned the letter   He did saying at the same time You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against	84.52001190185547
12154/28840	This action is somewhat too sublime to be	170.7147674560547
12155/28840	You think so   I am sure of	13.844145774841309
12156/28840	To whom was this letter addressed   To	86.25190734863281
12157/28840	What ails you said he at	63.752525329589844
12158/28840	Do you see that ray of sunlight   I	31.010530471801758
12159/28840	Well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to	73.39802551269531
12160/28840	Poor fellow poor young man And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you   He	92.69959259033203
12161/28840	And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter  	143.85609436035156
12162/28840	And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier  	52.631324768066406
12163/28840	Starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed His father his father   Yes his father replied the abbé his right name was Noirtier de Ville	37.17564392089844
12164/28840	At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure	56.5490837097168
12165/28840	The change that had come over Villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishmentall returned with a stunning force to his	121.96758270263672
12166/28840	He cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbés cell to his own and said I must be alone to think over all	65.12261962890625
12167/28840	When he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a	79.22784423828125
12168/28840	During these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn	149.00355529785156
12169/28840	Dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his	38.151981353759766
12170/28840	The reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual	108.73590087890625
12171/28840	He was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of	103.13298034667969
12172/28840	Now this was a Sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with	49.410438537597656
12173/28840	Dantès followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate	65.8495864868164
12174/28840	Faria bent on him his penetrating	95.87039947509766
12175/28840	I regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information I	129.8061981201172
12176/28840	Because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of	185.83863830566406
12177/28840	Let us talk of something else said	50.579559326171875
12178/28840	Again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with Dantès request he began to speak of other	39.27875518798828
12179/28840	The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrow	62.92079162597656
12180/28840	Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to	56.73942565917969
12181/28840	You must teach me a small part of what you know said Dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of	40.08590316772461
12182/28840	I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as	108.66586303710938
12183/28840	If you will only agree to my request I promise you never to mention another word about	68.4669189453125
12184/28840	Alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when I have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted you will know as much as I do	76.11307525634766
12185/28840	Now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I	124.53583526611328
12186/28840	Two years exclaimed Dantès do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time   Not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the	88.8848648071289
12187/28840	Memory makes the one philosophy the	155.91293334960938
12188/28840	But cannot one learn philosophy   Philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into	110.27263641357422
12189/28840	Well then said Dantès What shall you teach me first I am in a hurry to	33.91773986816406
12190/28840	And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following	81.87239074707031
12191/28840	In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé Dantès spoke no more of	37.45853042602539
12192/28840	Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of	144.55526733398438
12193/28840	Days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive	377.94012451171875
12194/28840	At the end of a year Dantès was a new	29.182918548583984
12195/28840	Dantès observed however that Faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his	78.43743896484375
12196/28840	Sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his	165.98492431640625
12197/28840	I have already told you answered the abbé that I loathe the idea of shedding	25.030866622924805
12198/28840	And yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of selfpres	74.40506744384766
12199/28840	No matter I could never agree to	106.28507995605469
12200/28840	Still you have thought of it   Incessantly alas cried the abb	38.45199203491211
12201/28840	And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked Dantès	41.518409729003906
12202/28840	I have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond	102.66719055175781
12203/28840	He shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion	65.8534164428711
12204/28840	No no cried the abbé impossible   Dantès endeavored to renew the subject the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further	21.1351375579834
12205/28840	Are you strong the abbé asked one day of Dantè	32.97987747192383
12206/28840	The young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened	62.80455017089844
12207/28840	And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort   I promise on my	60.26738739013672
12208/28840	Then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into	39.40684127807617
12209/28840	And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work   At least a	58.1427116394043
12210/28840	And shall we begin at once   At	72.86260986328125
12211/28840	We have lost a year to no purpose cried Dantè	38.86707305908203
12212/28840	Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb	36.69489288330078
12213/28840	Tut tut answered the abbé man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever	70.9189453125
12214/28840	Come let me show you my	90.35565948486328
12215/28840	The abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their	49.319976806640625
12216/28840	It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès with the passage which united	37.2839241027832
12217/28840	The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbés ladder of	62.24998474121094
12218/28840	Dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to	43.88067626953125
12219/28840	That very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate	169.1239471435547
12220/28840	Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys	161.52078247070312
12221/28840	They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his	104.84659576416016
12222/28840	At the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their	64.9161605834961
12223/28840	Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria who had remained in Edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great	40.11381530761719
12224/28840	Dantès hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly	24.18012237548828
12225/28840	Gracious heavens exclaimed Dantès what is the matter what has happened   Quick quick returned the abbé listen to what I have to	23.0649471282959
12226/28840	Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on	59.54877853393555
12227/28840	Tell me I beseech you what ails you cried Dantès letting his chisel fall to the	33.65167999267578
12228/28840	Alas faltered out the abbé all is over with	72.04080200195312
12229/28840	I am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness I can feel that the paroxysm is fast	96.62753295898438
12230/28840	I had a similar attack the year previous to my	200.01718139648438
12231/28840	This malady admits but of one remedy I will tell you what that	44.96882247924805
12232/28840	Go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there halffilled with a redlooking	68.92035675048828
12233/28840	Bring it to meor ratherno noI may be found here therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself	161.59689331054688
12234/28840	Thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with	44.58689880371094
12235/28840	I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor gro	64.9939956665039
12236/28840	On the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out	113.26358795166016
12237/28840	Take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated	86.046875
12238/28840	When I become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not beforebe careful about thisforce open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and I may perhaps	154.1942596435547
12239/28840	The fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a	120.94695281982422
12240/28840	Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the	158.771240234375
12241/28840	An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning	96.89402770996094
12242/28840	Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his	48.25322723388672
12243/28840	At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to	77.06776428222656
12244/28840	He is saved he is saved cried Dantès in a paroxysm of	21.118701934814453
12245/28840	The sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the	74.44111633300781
12246/28840	Dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jail	43.011959075927734
12247/28840	It was therefore near seven oclock but Edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his	129.54959106445312
12248/28840	The young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his	92.44573211669922
12249/28840	He had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his	35.308589935302734
12250/28840	Faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable	166.18910217285156
12251/28840	I did not expect to see you again said he feebly to Dantè	16.994348526000977
12252/28840	And why not asked the young	39.05575180053711
12253/28840	Did you fancy yourself dying   No I had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight I thought you might have made your	67.36862182617188
12254/28840	The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantè	50.072662353515625
12255/28840	Without you Did you really think me capable of that   At least said the abbé I now see how wrong such an opinion would have	36.85594177246094
12256/28840	Alas alas I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this	194.42652893066406
12257/28840	Be of good cheer replied Dantès your strength will	68.22126770019531
12258/28840	And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria and took his	49.07112503051758
12259/28840	The third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for	251.11483764648438
12260/28840	No no cried Dantès you are mistakenyou will not die And your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at	49.17051696777344
12261/28840	We shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite	91.94307708740234
12262/28840	My good Edmond answered the abbé be not	63.348731994628906
12263/28840	The attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a	82.634033203125
12264/28840	None can fly from a dungeon who cannot	259.4036560058594
12265/28840	Well we will waita week a month two months if need beand meanwhile your strength will	283.41387939453125
12266/28840	Everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we	117.0287094116211
12267/28840	As soon as you feel able to swim we will	102.34542083740234
12268/28840	I shall never swim again replied Far	73.4148941040039
12269/28840	This arm is paralyzed not for a time but	237.9879150390625
12270/28840	Lift it and judge if I am	345.1604919433594
12271/28840	The young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and	131.97804260253906
12272/28840	You are convinced now Edmond are you not asked the abb	32.812904357910156
12273/28840	Depend upon it I know what I	223.06529235839844
12274/28840	Since the first attack I experienced of this malady I have continually reflected on	94.01175689697266
12275/28840	Indeed I expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third	81.82696533203125
12276/28840	The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated Cabanis and he predicted a similar end for	97.90771484375
12277/28840	0233m       The physician may be mistaken exclaimed Dantè	12.80748176574707
12278/28840	And as for your poor arm what difference will that make I can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of	183.30162048339844
12279/28840	My son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty	56.216487884521484
12280/28840	Cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe	144.87890625
12281/28840	Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my	56.13792037963867
12282/28840	As for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoI give you back your	102.04046630859375
12283/28840	Then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old mans head he slowly added By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you	70.44378662109375
12284/28840	Faria gazed fondly on his nobleminded singlehearted highprincipled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his	81.14230346679688
12285/28840	Thanks murmured the invalid extending one	134.65232849121094
12286/28840	You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested	60.1027717590332
12287/28840	But as I cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the	91.79877471923828
12288/28840	That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being	137.32533264160156
12289/28840	Go then and set about this work in which unhappily I can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited	96.91375732421875
12290/28840	I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to	22.346616744995117
12291/28840	Dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed	18.368263244628906
12292/28840	Faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged	73.44308471679688
12293/28840	The Treasure   When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found Faria seated and looking	69.42998504638672
12294/28840	He did not speak but showed the paper to Dantè	30.052555084228516
12295/28840	Look at it said the abbé with a	16.531028747558594
12296/28840	I have looked at it with all possible attention said Dantès and I only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of	57.931392669677734
12297/28840	This paper my friend said Faria I may now avow to you since I have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to	77.93476104736328
12298/28840	The sweat started forth on Dantès	58.047664642333984
12299/28840	Until this day and for how long a timehe had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of	66.33074951171875
12300/28840	With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and Faria had been equally	97.50508880615234
12301/28840	He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by Faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental	104.21044921875
12302/28840	You have indeed a noble nature Edmond and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this	56.20504379272461
12303/28840	No be assured I am not	61.32593536376953
12304/28840	This treasure exists Dantès and if I have not been allowed to possess it you	35.817054748535156
12305/28840	No one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that I am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you	85.65167999267578
12306/28840	Alas murmured Edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse There was only this blow	110.30355072021484
12307/28840	Then he said aloud My dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile Tomorrow if you will I will hear your narrative but today I wish to nurse you	93.77490997314453
12308/28840	Besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry	170.95132446289062
12309/28840	On the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance Edmond replied the old	36.00730895996094
12310/28840	This idea was one of vengeance to me and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my	55.42630386352539
12311/28840	Edmond turned away his head with a	58.42998123168945
12312/28840	You persist in your incredulity Edmond continued Far	53.72220230102539
12313/28840	Well then read this paper which I have never shown to	90.67829132080078
12314/28840	Tomorrow my dear friend said Edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans	34.32871627807617
12315/28840	I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until	53.475990295410156
12316/28840	Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper	163.52920532226562
12317/28840	I will not irritate him thought Edmond and taking the paper of which half was wantinghaving been burnt no doubt by some accidenthe read   this treasure which may amount to	135.36343383789062
12318/28840	of Roman crowns in the most distant	41.13478469848633
12319/28840	25th April 149     Well said Faria when the young man had finished reading	22.77719497680664
12320/28840	Why replied Dantès I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by	49.49998092651367
12321/28840	Yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every	117.66216278076172
12322/28840	And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning   I am sure I have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this	51.92051315307617
12323/28840	It was the governor who hearing of Farias illness from the jailer had come in person to see	58.31496810913086
12324/28840	Faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with	94.82168579101562
12325/28840	His fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young	224.40676879882812
12326/28840	But fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indis	50.232704162597656
12327/28840	During this time Edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered	50.57072067260742
12328/28840	Faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with	72.20660400390625
12329/28840	Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one	65.15147399902344
12330/28840	Edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dantès	31.31117057800293
12331/28840	Here I am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant	57.35577392578125
12332/28840	You thought to escape my munificence but it is in	52.19599914550781
12333/28840	Edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside	50.485103607177734
12334/28840	You know said the abbé that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada the last of the princes of that	37.703372955322266

12339/28840	The cardinals house had no secrets for	77.40946960449219
12340/28840	I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family	200.93814086914062
12341/28840	One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the History of the City of	55.30744171142578

12346/28840	In the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell	83.31057739257812
12347/28840	There was a third point in view which will appear	191.123291015625
12348/28840	They were ambitious and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their	31.158939361572266
12349/28840	The result was that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the spec	63.934329986572266

12351/28840	The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at	67.99964141845703
12352/28840	Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two cardinals to	36.88093185424805
12353/28840	This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his	61.25182342529297
12354/28840	Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cup	56.55984878540039
12355/28840	This key was furnished with a small iron pointa negligence on the part of the locks	79.91250610351562
12356/28840	When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next	94.44169616699219
12357/28840	Then there was the ring with the lions head which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the	60.12281036376953
12358/28840	The lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twentyfour hours the bite was	115.92413330078125
12359/28840	Cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but Alexander	57.37806701660156
12360/28840	replied Now as to the worthy cardinals Spada and Rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money	63.728694915771484

12362/28840	Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to	68.44097900390625
12363/28840	The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near San Pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by	91.35659790039062
12364/28840	Rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating	64.72622680664062
12365/28840	Spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his	201.66064453125
12366/28840	He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find	84.0145263671875
12367/28840	Spada knew what these invitations meant since Christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in Rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message Cæsar wills that you	129.3492889404297
12368/28840	but it was a legate _à latere_ who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope His holiness requests you to dine with	58.6295280456543
12369/28840	Spada set out about two oclock to San Pierdare	109.1105728149414
12370/28840	The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew in full costume and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked attent	64.16644287109375
12371/28840	Spada turned pale as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well	42.7845573425293
12372/28840	They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his	105.9798583984375
12373/28840	The nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the	264.9459533691406
12374/28840	It was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes but	133.3976287841797
12375/28840	Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to	163.9302520751953
12376/28840	An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating	297.8832092285156

12378/28840	Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead	38.24687194824219
12379/28840	The heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that Spada the rich man was really the most miserable of unclesno treasuresunless they were those of science contained in the library and	123.53524017333984
12380/28840	They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruit	68.83277130126953
12381/28840	There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his	65.32498931884766

12384/28840	After the popes death and his sons exile it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinals time but this was not the	72.15064239501953

12391/28840	He did so and thus doubled his	209.42938232421875
12392/28840	The celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the counts	74.32003784179688

12395/28840	I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the gen	61.86379623413086

12400/28840	0243m       I awoke as the clock was striking	43.0262451171875
12401/28840	I raised my head I was in utter	75.95431518554688
12402/28840	I rang for a light but as no one came I determined to find one for	91.19882202148438
12403/28840	It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of	135.7544403076172
12404/28840	I took a waxcandle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my matchbox being empty with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the em	67.02123260498047
12405/28840	I felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to	124.84001922607422
12406/28840	But beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended I saw yellowish characters appear on the	162.7389373779297
12407/28840	It was that paper you read this morning read it again Dantès and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected	119.08665466308594
12408/28840	Faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to Dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust        This 25th day of April 1498	36.864967346191406

12416/28840	which treasure I bequeath and leave	150.0349884033203
12417/28840	And now said the abbé read this other paper and he presented to Dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which Edmond read as	68.29671478271484

12424/28840	Faria followed him with an excited	87.97135162353516

12426/28840	Dantès obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following   0245m       This 25th day of April 1498	15.276959419250488

12441/28840	It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada and the will so long sought for replied Edmond still incred	98.90719604492188
12442/28840	Yes a thousand times yes   And who completed it as it now is   I	47.222808837890625
12443/28840	Aided by the remaining fragment I guessed the rest measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above	89.3875961303711
12444/28840	Now continued Faria addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as I do	28.977134704589844
12445/28840	If we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if I die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to	144.43743896484375
12446/28840	But inquired Dantès hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves   No no be easy on that score the family is	46.72631072998047

12450/28840	2   Impossible said Dantès staggered at the enormous	51.6695442199707
12451/28840	Impossible and why asked the old	125.65300750732422
12452/28840	Edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and	102.12468719482422
12453/28840	I have only kept this secret so long from you continued Faria that I might test your character and then surprise	89.8099594116211
12454/28840	Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me th	43.93696594238281
12455/28840	Well Dantès you do not thank me   This treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied Dantès and to you	20.883289337158203
12456/28840	You are my son Dantès exclaimed the old	17.889848709106445
12457/28840	You are the child of my	72.02561950683594
12458/28840	God has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get	48.11082458496094
12459/28840	And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and we	54.66921615600586
12460/28840	The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo but Dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twentyfive miles from Pianosa between Corsica and the Island of Elba and had once touched	27.3054256439209
12461/28840	This island was always had been and still is completely	215.72991943359375
12462/28840	It is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the	74.6102066040039
12463/28840	Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the	46.17125701904297
12464/28840	But Dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old	32.94744110107422
12465/28840	However as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was	119.22767639160156
12466/28840	They had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled	116.12712097167969
12467/28840	But for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to Edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been	53.4043083190918
12468/28840	Thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their	80.01217651367188
12469/28840	You see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to Faria that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to	37.34381103515625
12470/28840	I have promised to remain forever with you and now I could not break my promise if I	39.291316986083984
12471/28840	The treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this	118.58670043945312
12472/28840	These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themthis is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and	69.64454650878906
12473/28840	I owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even Cæsar Borgia himself could not deprive me of	44.64802169799805
12474/28840	Thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went	431.30206298828125
12475/28840	Faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of	92.9517593383789
12476/28840	As he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it	98.26725006103516
12477/28840	But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would	81.36602020263672
12478/28840	For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart and Dantès knew it from the first to the last	52.09019470214844
12479/28840	Then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real	134.04981994628906
12480/28840	Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantèsinstructions which were to serve him when he was at	81.7761001586914
12481/28840	In the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least toler	223.19447326660156
12482/28840	They were thus perpetually employedFaria that he might not see himself grow old Dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the	124.81996154785156
12483/28840	So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of	101.69181823730469
12484/28840	But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when Faria was left alone and when Edmond returned to his	62.42771911621094
12485/28840	One night Edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling	218.91297912597656
12486/28840	He opened his eyes upon utter	94.08333587646484
12487/28840	His name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached	127.8292236328125
12488/28840	He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his	58.26991271972656
12489/28840	Undoubtedly the call came from Farias	281.6135559082031
12490/28840	Alas murmured Edmond can it be   He moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was	53.5213623046875
12491/28840	By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken Dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bed	53.23745346069336
12492/28840	His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first	57.43812561035156
12493/28840	Silence he said or you are	101.46135711669922
12494/28840	We must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight	152.02935791015625
12495/28840	It would require years to do again what I have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each	106.66967010498047
12496/28840	Besides be assured my dear Edmond the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of	111.7775650024414
12497/28840	Perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while I have been but a hind	70.0676498413086
12498/28840	You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your	95.90465545654297
12499/28840	At length Providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time I should	94.40464782714844

12501/28840	Quick quick tell me what I must do this time are there any fresh instructions Speak my friend I	199.7646942138672
12502/28840	Oh yes yes exclaimed Dantès and I tell you that I will save you	27.446260452270508
12503/28840	I feel the blood flowing towards my	183.18270874023438
12504/28840	These horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a	83.32817077636719
12505/28840	Oh exclaimed Dantès his heart wrung with	34.78493118286133
12506/28840	Do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to	153.58871459960938
12507/28840	If after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that I do not recover then pour the rest down my	127.61265563964844
12508/28840	Now lift me on my bed for I can no longer support	63.47806167602539
12509/28840	Edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the	30.793909072875977
12510/28840	My son I bless thee   The young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans	31.880603790283203
12511/28840	Listen now to what I say in this my dying	283.9999084472656
12512/28840	God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or	241.29922485351562
12513/28840	I see it in the depths of the inner	37.46340560913086
12514/28840	My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much	46.429317474365234
12515/28840	If you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not	78.68400573730469
12516/28840	Hasten to Monte Cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered long	128.38516235351562
12517/28840	A violent convulsion attacked the old	114.93476867675781
12518/28840	Dantès raised his head and saw Farias eyes injected with	17.27630615234375
12519/28840	It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the	68.42061614990234
12520/28840	Oh yes yes be assured I shall save you Besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were	82.27054595947266
12521/28840	Do not mistake I suffer less because there is in me less strength to	272.0158386230469
12522/28840	At your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more	181.06263732910156
12523/28840	The crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested	137.02378845214844
12524/28840	Dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened	61.21683883666992
12525/28840	With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the rest	185.395751953125
12526/28840	When he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much	122.74584197998047
12527/28840	He waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hourno change took	59.829044342041016
12528/28840	Trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his	54.77134704589844
12529/28840	Then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his	68.33939361572266
12530/28840	It was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the	82.32584381103516
12531/28840	Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of	55.82895278930664
12532/28840	While the struggle between day and night lasted Dantès still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a	44.626949310302734
12533/28840	Then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vainthey opened again as soon as	121.28473663330078
12534/28840	He extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he	73.80323791503906
12535/28840	It was time for the jailer was	73.09029388427734
12536/28840	On this occasion he began his rounds at Dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to Farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some	84.2214584350586
12537/28840	Nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had	37.043739318847656
12538/28840	Dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate	19.47812271118164
12539/28840	He therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for	40.64057540893555
12540/28840	Other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of	325.1846923828125
12541/28840	Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the	65.88410186767578
12542/28840	The governor then went out and words of pity fell on Dantès listening ears mingled with brutal	105.88201904296875
12543/28840	Well well said one the madman has gone to look after his	173.92483520507812
12544/28840	Good journey to him   With all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said	68.37299346923828
12545/28840	They may give him the honors of the	148.2919921875
12546/28840	Edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was	122.43771362304688
12547/28840	The voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the	80.15973663330078
12548/28840	Still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the	94.03870391845703
12549/28840	He remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to	83.1865234375
12550/28840	At the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which	60.8748664855957
12551/28840	It was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other	123.66400909423828
12552/28840	There was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead	35.59651565551758
12553/28840	The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was	56.35446548461914
12554/28840	Questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his	62.429176330566406
12555/28840	I am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no	55.56660461425781
12556/28840	Ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years Ill answer for it without any attempt to	58.66171646118164
12557/28840	Still said the governor I believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that I doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is	73.61102294921875
12558/28840	There was a moment of complete silence during which Dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second	34.390785217285156
12559/28840	You may make your mind easy said the doctor he is	30.169326782226562
12560/28840	You know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple	86.05795288085938
12561/28840	In spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by	144.78269958496094
12562/28840	Let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless	115.14585876464844
12563/28840	This order to heat the irons made Dantès	104.48973846435547
12564/28840	He heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying   Here is the brazier light	69.727783203125
12565/28840	There was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in	51.84830856323242
12566/28840	The perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should	35.1342887878418
12567/28840	You see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is	125.2586669921875
12568/28840	The poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his	194.70875549316406
12569/28840	Wasnt his name Faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the	109.41129302978516
12570/28840	0259m       Yes sir and as he said it was an ancient	19.630962371826172
12571/28840	He was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure but on that indeed he was intract	85.6843490600586
12572/28840	It is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the	56.0221061706543
12573/28840	You had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abb	39.645904541015625
12574/28840	Never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me	72.50275421142578
12575/28840	One day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured	216.1365203857422
12576/28840	Ah ah said the doctor I did not know that I had a rival but I hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in	61.58245849609375
12577/28840	Yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can	64.40674591064453
12578/28840	Will that satisfy you   Must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turn	122.39789581298828
12579/28840	But make hasteI cannot stay here all	203.86949157714844
12580/28840	Will there be any mass asked one of the	296.8778381347656
12581/28840	The chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to Hyères for a	50.023311614990234
12582/28840	I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his	54.18549728393555
12583/28840	If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requ	20.02996826171875
12584/28840	Pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a church	71.97745513916016
12585/28840	God will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a	202.07647705078125
12586/28840	A shout of laughter followed this brutal j	457.8412780761719
12587/28840	Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going	138.3694610595703
12588/28840	This evening said the governor when the task was	108.52320861816406
12589/28840	Shall we watch by the corpse   Of what use would it be Shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is	92.34290313720703
12590/28840	Then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the	56.367042541503906
12591/28840	It was empty and Dantès emerged from the	33.31905746459961
12592/28840	A barrier had been placed between Dantès and his old	38.91299819946289
12593/28840	No longer could Edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence	102.21510314941406
12594/28840	Faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer	74.44293212890625
12595/28840	He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy rever	65.20502471923828
12596/28840	If I could die he said I should go where he goes and should assuredly find him	86.69697570800781
12597/28840	But how to die It is very easy he went on with a smile I will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine	56.282684326171875
12598/28840	But excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the	77.16204071044922
12599/28840	Dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and	80.24237823486328
12600/28840	Die oh no he exclaimednot die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much Die yes had I died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of	147.79100036621094
12601/28840	No I want to live I shall struggle to the very last I will yet win back the happiness of which I have been	93.77665710449219
12602/28840	Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to	103.4427719116211
12603/28840	Yet they will forget me here and I shall die in my dungeon like Far	59.79056930541992
12604/28840	As he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing	114.73228454589844
12605/28840	Suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the	60.0628662109375
12606/28840	He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that	41.73136901855469
12607/28840	Dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed	43.46337127685547
12608/28840	In that case his last hope would have been	80.48878479003906
12609/28840	Now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to	138.95693969726562
12610/28840	He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome	51.7298583984375
12611/28840	If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and thenso much the better all would be	89.11666870117188
12612/28840	Dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it	29.767425537109375
12613/28840	His situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but	218.06854248046875
12614/28840	This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to Dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover	46.05354309082031
12615/28840	When seven oclock came Dantès agony really	60.30280303955078
12616/28840	His hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his	42.868831634521484
12617/28840	From time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of	95.82049560546875
12618/28840	Then he thought he was going to	49.737979888916016
12619/28840	Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and Dantès knew that he had escaped the first	39.11404800415039
12620/28840	At length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the	102.03453063964844
12621/28840	Edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his	51.37361145019531
12622/28840	The footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand Dantès guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handb	73.75489807128906
12623/28840	The door opened and a dim light reached Dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its	60.03749465942383
12624/28840	The two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extrem	129.99276733398438
12625/28840	Hes heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the	291.7884826660156
12626/28840	They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the	201.89984130859375
12627/28840	Have you tied the knot inquired the first	350.1618957519531
12628/28840	What would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply I can do that when we get	74.42253112792969
12629/28840	They deposited the supposed corpse on the b	244.20936584472656
12630/28840	Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the	72.93338775634766
12631/28840	Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and Dantès knew that the mistral was	49.51500701904297
12632/28840	It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely ming	146.93618774414062
12633/28840	The bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the	137.0851593017578
12634/28840	One of them went away and Dantès heard his shoes striking on the	38.73826599121094
12635/28840	Really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the handbar	80.13860321044922
12636/28840	Dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt	30.261552810668945
12637/28840	Give us a light said the other bearer or I shall never find what I am looking	68.08513641357422
12638/28840	The man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite	218.78399658203125
12639/28840	What can he be looking for thought Ed	90.08094024658203
12640/28840	An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found the object of his	37.019100189208984
12641/28840	Here it is at last he said not without some trouble	154.19300842285156
12642/28840	Yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by	171.3660125732422
12643/28840	As he said this the man came towards Edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful	63.876644134521484
12644/28840	Well have you tied the knot inquired the gravedigger who was looking	64.6416244506836
12645/28840	Yes and pretty tight too I can tell you was the	137.08241271972656
12646/28840	And the bier was lifted once more and they	186.7572784423828
12647/28840	They advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward	72.0994644165039
12648/28840	The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the château is built reached Dantès ear distinctly as they went	51.29512023925781
12649/28840	Bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the	115.03094482421875
12650/28840	Why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal	57.39101028442383
12651/28840	Dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his	17.833337783813477
12652/28840	Well here we are at last said one of	44.2174186706543
12653/28840	A little farthera little farther said the	152.4530792236328
12654/28840	You know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless	81.44264221191406
12655/28840	They ascended five or six more steps and then Dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and	42.88201141357422
12656/28840	One said the gravediggers two three   And at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curd	62.71223068237305
12657/28840	Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a	62.92754364013672
12658/28840	At last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the	58.124969482421875
12659/28840	Dantès had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirtysixpound shot tied to his	30.9472713470459
12660/28840	The sea is the cemetery of the Château d	18.13385009765625
12661/28840	He then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually str	51.70437240600586
12662/28840	With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his	90.0448226928711
12663/28840	Dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being	42.121795654296875
12664/28840	When he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first	58.72746276855469
12665/28840	Behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two	162.49732971191406
12666/28840	He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange gravediggers had heard his	65.23043060302734
12667/28840	Dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the	33.79836654663086
12668/28840	This was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the	63.785240173339844
12669/28840	When he came up again the light had	140.02381896972656
12670/28840	Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Château dIf but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of Da	51.17583465576172
12671/28840	Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès	122.6501235961914
12672/28840	The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château dIf Dantès nevertheless determined to make for	22.83077049255371
12673/28840	But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night   At this moment he saw the light of Planier gleaming in front of him like a	29.644420623779297
12674/28840	By leaving this light on the right he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find	80.3580093383789
12675/28840	But as we have said it was at least a league from the Château dIf to this	18.53464126586914
12676/28840	These words rang in Dantès ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his	41.389163970947266
12677/28840	He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a	49.50987243652344
12678/28840	Fear that relentless pursuer clogged Dantès	67.62654876708984
12679/28840	He listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the	70.78343200683594
12680/28840	He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his	73.94861602783203
12681/28840	He swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the	67.3242416381836
12682/28840	He could not see it but he _felt_ its	67.85582733154297
12683/28840	An hour passed during which Dantès excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the	68.05738067626953
12684/28840	Let us see said he I have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if I am not mistaken I must be close to Tiboul	64.55143737792969
12685/28840	But what if I were mistaken   A shudder passed over	51.24611282348633
12686/28840	He sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuper	54.687808990478516
12687/28840	Well said he I will swim on until I am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then I shall sink and he struck out with the energy of	86.79029083251953
12688/28840	Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his	58.06978988647461
12689/28840	He fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard	40.264034271240234
12690/28840	Then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the	68.222900390625
12691/28840	Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent	94.08274841308594
12692/28840	Dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than	49.92157745361328
12693/28840	Then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter	85.77081298828125
12694/28840	At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of	42.271141052246094
12695/28840	The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic	103.12948608398438
12696/28840	Dantès had not been deceivedhe had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact Tiboul	27.22681999206543
12697/28840	He knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to Lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for conceal	127.12065124511719
12698/28840	An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its	90.16658782958984
12699/28840	Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their	114.81617736816406
12700/28840	He was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the	45.67030715942383
12701/28840	It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the	83.614990234375
12702/28840	He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for fourandtwenty	21.33416748046875
12703/28840	He extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the	63.477455139160156
12704/28840	As he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the	57.67929458618164
12705/28840	By its light between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle a quarter of a league distant Dantès saw a fishingboat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and	57.5888786315918
12706/28840	A second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapid	188.9273681640625
12707/28840	Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it	46.210205078125
12708/28840	Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rud	88.80484008789062
12709/28840	The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the	166.36431884765625
12710/28840	Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast seab	142.62847900390625
12711/28840	At the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of	61.674381256103516
12712/28840	Dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless	100.79955291748047
12713/28840	Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to	81.42276000976562
12714/28840	By degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright	86.50418090820312
12715/28840	Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with	55.59456253051758
12716/28840	Dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the Château dIf he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be	33.05870056152344
12717/28840	He turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and	165.745361328125
12718/28840	The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the	83.84207916259766
12719/28840	In two or three hours thought Dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the	85.02428436279297
12720/28840	Then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered will be	108.54521179199219
12721/28840	Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched	491.5462646484375
12722/28840	The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and fam	300.578369140625
12723/28840	The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by	99.37279510498047
12724/28840	I have lost even the knife that saved	157.0013427734375
12725/28840	Oh my God I have suffered enough surely Have pity on me and do for me what I am unable to do for	60.91026306152344
12726/28840	She was coming out of Marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the	96.65531921386719
12727/28840	In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps I have not been missed at the	97.4261245727539
12728/28840	I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last	74.12602233886719
12729/28840	My story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict	98.48566436767578
12730/28840	As he spoke Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishingvessel had been wrecked and	58.30245590209961
12731/28840	The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessels keel floated at the foot of the cr	47.3804931640625
12732/28840	In an instant Dantès plan was	41.39414596557617
12733/28840	He swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was	78.41204833984375
12734/28840	He soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the Château dIf and the tower of Plan	33.993038177490234
12735/28840	For an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for Italy between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraign	104.61727142333984
12736/28840	However the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of	51.2921257019043
12737/28840	He rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another	93.69061279296875
12738/28840	Dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his	42.55384826660156
12739/28840	It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting	90.6820068359375
12740/28840	Dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards	110.27631378173828
12741/28840	Then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her	195.1083984375
12742/28840	By a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to	97.31729125976562
12743/28840	This time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards	58.441322326660156
12744/28840	At the same time he saw they were about to lower the	42.34767532348633
12745/28840	An instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards	86.45926666259766
12746/28840	Dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet	60.426082611083984
12747/28840	But he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to	116.82498168945312
12748/28840	His arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breath	165.742919921875
12749/28840	The two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in Italian Courage   The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his	65.95501708984375
12750/28840	He rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his	106.02191162109375
12751/28840	The water passed over his head and the sky turned	72.04254913330078
12752/28840	A convulsive movement again brought him to the	82.28507232666016
12753/28840	He felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard	120.10059356689453
12754/28840	When he opened his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the tart	19.756010055541992
12755/28840	His first care was to see what course they were	168.15313720703125
12756/28840	They were rapidly leaving the Château dIf	43.65119171142578
12757/28840	Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a	35.361183166503906
12758/28840	As we have said he was lying on the	34.9017333984375
12759/28840	A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elastic	130.89666748046875
12760/28840	Who are you said the pilot in bad	204.48648071289062
12761/28840	I am replied Dantès in bad Italian a Maltese	49.878055572509766
12762/28840	We were coming from Syracuse laden with	164.54086303710938
12763/28840	The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou and we were wrecked on these	105.55268096923828
12764/28840	Where do you come from   From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all	51.36994552612305
12765/28840	I saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your	95.1139907836914
12766/28840	You have saved my life and I thank you continued Dantè	22.79314613342285
12767/28840	I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my	118.88105010986328
12768/28840	It was I said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were	123.30230712890625
12769/28840	Yes returned Dantès holding out his hand I thank you	20.380861282348633
12770/28840	I almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot	201.65005493164062
12771/28840	Dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Château d	17.488740921020508
12772/28840	Yes said he I made a vow to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow	92.15718841552734
12773/28840	Now what are we to do with you said the	36.200923919677734
12774/28840	My captain is dead I have barely escaped but I am a good	114.18997955322266
12775/28840	Leave me at the first port you make I shall be sure to find	76.44844055175781
12776/28840	Do you know the Mediterranean   I have sailed over it since my	85.73548126220703
12777/28840	You know the best harbors   There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my	50.21274185180664
12778/28840	I say captain said the sailor who had cried Courage to Dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us   If he says true said the captain doubting	64.05449676513672
12779/28840	But in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it	189.55938720703125
12780/28840	I will do more than I promise said Dantè	18.721220016479492
12781/28840	We shall see returned the other	112.78807067871094
12782/28840	Then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind   Because we should run straight on to the Island of R	80.97644805908203
12783/28840	You shall pass it by twenty fath	68.67314910888672
12784/28840	Take the helm and let us see what you	61.40400314331055
12785/28840	The young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a firstrate sailor she yet was tolerably	126.84931945800781
12786/28840	The four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked	94.57377624511719
12787/28840	This order was also executed and the vessel passed as Dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to wind	59.056949615478516
12788/28840	And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of	76.74589538574219
12789/28840	You see said Dantès quitting the helm I shall be of some use to you at least during the	38.46562576293945
12790/28840	If you do not want me at Leghorn you can leave me there and I will pay you out of the first wages I get for my food and the clothes you lend	42.43613052368164
12791/28840	Ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are	69.54933166503906
12792/28840	Give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned Dantè	47.152896881103516

12810/28840	A prisoner has escaped from the Château dIf and they are firing the alarm gun replied Dantè	30.64255714416504
12811/28840	The captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died	89.77694702148438

12815/28840	What is the day of the month asked he of Jacopo who sat down beside	37.35788345336914
12816/28840	I ask you what year is it   The year 1829 returned Jacop	29.741426467895508
12817/28840	It was fourteen years day for day since Dantès	108.31755065917969
12818/28840	He was nineteen when he entered the Château dIf he was thirtythree when he	31.622989654541016
12819/28840	A sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of Mercédès who must believe him	39.20008850097656
12820/28840	Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a	52.62900161743164
12821/28840	He renewed against Danglars Fernand and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his	44.90607452392578
12822/28840	This oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Legh	71.88716888427734
12823/28840	The Smugglers   Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been	32.157997131347656
12824/28840	It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smugg	43.662784576416016
12825/28840	At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of	38.32523727416992
12826/28840	This made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his	67.3566665649414
12827/28840	Thus the Genoese subtle as he was was duped by Edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation	67.33990478515625
12828/28840	Moreover it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should	37.230323791503906
12829/28840	In this state of mutual understanding they reached Legh	68.7813949584961
12830/28840	Here Edmond was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen	50.34990692138672
12831/28840	He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had	64.01181030273438
12832/28840	His comrades believed that his vow was	442.3724365234375
12833/28840	As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn he remembered a barber in	63.791053771972656
12834/28840	Ferdinand Street he went there to have his beard and hair	696.958740234375
12835/28840	The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of Titians	64.91727447509766
12836/28840	At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of	88.63984680175781
12837/28840	The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to	128.52777099609375
12838/28840	When the operation was concluded and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking	79.96063995361328

12842/28840	As to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost ho	88.56109619140625
12843/28840	Moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the	84.35493469238281
12844/28840	Edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendif indeed he had any friend leftcould recognize him he could not recognize	85.20343017578125
12845/28840	The master of _La Jeune Amélie_ who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmonds value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which Edmond had	35.92951583862305
12846/28840	His next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a	105.08628845214844
12847/28840	Attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dantès but Dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three	55.282108306884766
12848/28840	_La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as	59.40774154663086

12850/28840	The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of Corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to	115.30947875976562

12852/28840	He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left and went towards the country of Paoli and	126.44772338867188
12853/28840	The next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found Dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy	80.89822387695312
12854/28840	It was the Island of Monte Crist	21.047304153442383
12855/28840	_La Jeune Amélie_ left it threequarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Cors	30.98606300354004
12856/28840	Dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised	41.99180603027344
12857/28840	But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself Besides what would the sailors say What would the patron think He must	183.22402954101562
12858/28840	Fortunately Dantès had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for	56.61723709106445
12859/28840	Dantès noticed that the captain of _La Jeune Amélie_ had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or	47.280250549316406
12860/28840	But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and polit	72.35442352294922
12861/28840	The same night such a man of regularity was the patron of _La Jeune Amélie_ the profits were divided and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres or about eighty franc	41.39248275756836
12862/28840	They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been	123.86383819580078
12863/28840	The second operation was as successful as the first _La Jeune Amélie_ was in	30.80734634399414
12864/28840	This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars sherry and Malaga	100.38459014892578
12865/28840	There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune Amélie	33.740421295166016
12866/28840	A customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded Dantès was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left	90.12317657470703
12867/28840	Dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear	116.24040985107422
12868/28840	He had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher Pain thou art not an	148.08360290527344
12869/28840	He had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon	166.26614379882812

12874/28840	As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of	65.17900085449219
12875/28840	But this sufficed for Jacopo who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which Edmond had concealed from all	60.65653610229492
12876/28840	And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave se	73.24964141845703
12877/28840	He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where God writes in azure with letters of	83.6643295288086
12878/28840	And when Jacopo inquired of him What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me Edmond replied Who knows You may one day be the captain of a	73.81175231933594
12879/28840	We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Cors	54.05612564086914
12880/28840	He had passed and repassed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing	63.26894760131836
12881/28840	Then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied	74.67919158935547
12882/28840	But in this world we must risk	131.12857055664062
12883/28840	Prison had made Edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk	103.07747650146484
12884/28840	But in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companions	69.27845001220703
12885/28840	This time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets stuffs of the Levant and cashme	118.95873260498047
12886/28840	It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of	87.09612274169922

12888/28840	At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca	49.35943603515625
12889/28840	When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following	53.75368118286133
12890/28840	Edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done	190.5218505859375
12891/28840	Nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following	135.4623565673828

12893/28840	The night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through Dantès	79.77890014648438
12894/28840	If he closed his eyes he saw Cardinal Spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his	74.75550079345703

12898/28840	All was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it	70.04890441894531
12899/28840	The day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his	66.06780242919922
12900/28840	Night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal Dantès	98.71863555908203
12901/28840	He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and	107.2250747680664
12902/28840	The old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and	78.20193481445312

12939/28840	Scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a	82.661376953125
12940/28840	This and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano was the bill of	133.64703369140625
12941/28840	Dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about	70.13286590576172
12942/28840	Having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom Jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital	68.7020263671875
12943/28840	Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his	58.13132095336914
12944/28840	At this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contempt	252.3477325439453
12945/28840	Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that I shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost	163.53457641601562
12946/28840	Oh no exclaimed Edmond that will not	82.50355529785156
12947/28840	The wise unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one	92.74955749511719
12948/28840	Besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched	149.43544006347656
12949/28840	Thus Dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for	96.37127685546875
12950/28840	The cause was not in Dantès but in Providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless	73.54656982421875
12951/28840	Meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have	85.74774932861328
12952/28840	Keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of	125.91686248779297
12953/28840	Time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite	92.6359634399414
12954/28840	Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lic	121.45511627197266
12955/28840	So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks	91.46792602539062
12956/28840	The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest	524.29248046875
12957/28840	Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so	70.10888671875
12958/28840	This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying	108.32524871826172
12959/28840	A large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to	116.1090087890625
12960/28840	Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his	85.08515930175781
12961/28840	Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the	154.36862182617188
12962/28840	Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed	40.78583908081055
12963/28840	The sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards	214.55714416503906
12964/28840	But even while they watched his daring progress Edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and	89.23355865478516
12965/28840	They all rushed towards him for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority yet Jacopo reached him	132.5816192626953
12966/28840	He found Edmond lying prone bleeding and almost	140.84344482421875
12967/28840	He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen	52.65559768676758
12968/28840	They poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as	91.25654602050781
12969/28840	Edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his lo	111.79808044433594
12970/28840	They wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under Jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be	74.09683227539062
12971/28840	It may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their	52.469661712646484
12972/28840	As for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be	66.12083435058594
12973/28840	The sailors did not require much	275.5387268066406
12974/28840	They were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremon	139.39300537109375
12975/28840	All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a mossgrown	71.41790008544922
12976/28840	But instead of growing easier Dantès pains appeared to increase in	98.74729919433594
12977/28840	The old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France between Nice and Fréjus urged Dantès to try and	59.30293273925781
12978/28840	Edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning	104.61038208007812
12979/28840	He has broken his ribs said the commander in a low	74.8721923828125
12980/28840	No matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave	40.3449821472168
12981/28840	We will try and carry him on board the tart	44.746978759765625
12982/28840	Dantès declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost	63.4587516784668
12983/28840	Well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like	113.61074829101562
12984/28840	This very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed	157.3157958984375
12985/28840	The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its	69.00674438476562
12986/28840	Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his	40.4889030456543
12987/28840	No no he said to the patron I was awkward and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clums	75.97640991210938
12988/28840	Leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for	114.93767547607422
12989/28840	But youll die of hunger said the	105.01416015625
12990/28840	I would rather do so was Edmonds reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes	68.27405548095703
12991/28840	The patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be	147.79092407226562
12992/28840	What are we to do Maltese asked the	75.41316223144531
12993/28840	We cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot	125.09589385986328
12994/28840	We shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up	57.85260772705078
12995/28840	Why said Dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishingboat desire them to come here to	42.56723403930664
12996/28840	I will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to Legh	39.73619079589844
12997/28840	If you do not come across one return for	60.83537292480469
12998/28840	Listen Captain Baldi theres one way of settling this said Jacop	70.24893188476562
12999/28840	Do you go and I will stay and take care of the wounded	34.82441711425781
13000/28840	And give up your share of the venture said Edmond to remain with me   Yes said Jacopo and without any	48.70058059692383
13001/28840	You are a good fellow and a kindhearted messmate replied Edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but I do not wish anyone to stay with	43.93966293334961
13002/28840	A day or two of rest will set me up and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for	128.2733612060547
13003/28840	A peculiar smile passed over Dantès lips he squeezed Jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain	109.77826690673828
13004/28840	The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which Edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his	70.59934997558594
13005/28840	Then when they had disappeared he said with a smileTis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and	70.60884094238281
13006/28840	At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he	41.59974670410156
13007/28840	Then Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted	56.906005859375
13008/28840	The Secret Cave   The sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the	75.56946563720703
13009/28840	Thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the	93.57930755615234
13010/28840	At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to cr	59.601478576660156
13011/28840	In a word the island was inhabited yet Edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of	84.94574737548828
13012/28840	He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and	103.4452896118164
13013/28840	This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every	49.54373550415039
13014/28840	It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that Edmond fixed his	38.85630416870117
13015/28840	The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the Island of Cors	84.67891693115234
13016/28840	He then looked at the objects near	99.80126953125
13017/28840	He saw that he was on the highest point of the islanda statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of	62.5527458190918
13018/28840	Then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in	165.72584533691406
13019/28840	Dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient n	52.87746810913086
13020/28840	This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from	88.53491973876953
13021/28840	It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the circular	50.959320068359375
13022/28840	One thing only perplexed Edmond and destroyed his	265.49407958984375
13023/28840	How could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men   Suddenly an idea flashed across his	98.13127899169922
13024/28840	Instead of raising it thought he they have lowered	548.841064453125
13025/28840	And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly	90.54629516601562
13026/28840	He soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now	110.66337585449219
13027/28840	0301m       Dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious art	38.119930267333984
13028/28840	He attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pick	86.61408996582031
13029/28840	After ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was	104.41512298583984
13030/28840	Dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a	64.95325469970703
13031/28840	But the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he Hercules	166.9536590576172
13032/28840	Dantès saw that he must attack the	36.49858856201172
13033/28840	But how   He cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left	32.11738586425781
13034/28840	He smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this	123.97114562988281
13035/28840	With the aid of his pickaxe Dantès after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpet	65.26244354248047
13036/28840	Dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the	65.24644470214844
13037/28840	The intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the	80.56058502197266
13038/28840	The rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its	138.20501708984375
13039/28840	Dantès redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient Titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the	32.67112731933594
13040/28840	The rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the	337.19921875
13041/28840	On the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag	177.83543395996094
13042/28840	Dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect	48.45458221435547
13043/28840	He would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to	55.281394958496094
13044/28840	This feeling lasted but for a	87.23731994628906
13045/28840	Edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous gro	74.2753677368164
13046/28840	Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of	110.69963836669922
13047/28840	Come said he to himself be a	39.46162796020508
13048/28840	I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been	36.189247131347656
13049/28840	What then would be the use of all I have suffered The heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions	117.41667938232422
13050/28840	He remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his	31.253398895263672
13051/28840	Now that I expect nothing now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of	100.0154037475586
13052/28840	And he remained again motionless and	176.95639038085938
13053/28840	Yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal band	105.30133056640625
13054/28840	This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvel	203.7696990966797
13055/28840	0303m       But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked Dantès of	20.59966278076172
13056/28840	The fate replied he smiling of those who buried Alaric and were interred with the	222.43130493164062
13057/28840	Yet had he come thought Dantès he would have found the treasure and Borgia he who compared Italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this	94.8624267578125
13058/28840	Alas said Edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious	120.15242767333984
13059/28840	But he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by	105.17090606689453
13060/28840	In the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals	44.097923278808594
13061/28840	He had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the	62.72365188598633
13062/28840	He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions	94.49976348876953
13063/28840	The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès forehead large drops of pers	45.549137115478516
13064/28840	At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must	81.5446548461914
13065/28840	He again struck it and with greater	164.16273498535156
13066/28840	As he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white	80.48133087158203
13067/28840	The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate	196.3380889892578
13068/28840	Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interst	27.266674041748047
13069/28840	But by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that Faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over	86.4356918334961
13070/28840	The island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue	62.458412170410156
13071/28840	Dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the	45.87015914916992
13072/28840	The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the	81.3808364868164
13073/28840	He had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by	56.135562896728516
13074/28840	The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of	165.23046875
13075/28840	At last after renewed hesitation Dantès entered the second gro	72.60066986083984
13076/28840	The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer	79.95591735839844
13077/28840	He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went	108.4856948852539
13078/28840	At the left of the opening was a dark and deep	80.75038146972656
13079/28840	But to Dantès eye there was no	42.858238220214844
13080/28840	He glanced around this second grotto it was like the first	79.45381927490234
13081/28840	The treasure if it existed was buried in this	157.3946533203125
13082/28840	The time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and Dantès fate would be	82.0776138305664
13083/28840	He advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pick	109.48002624511719

13087/28840	He again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same	83.36251068115234

13091/28840	This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract	49.462501525878906

13098/28840	In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals	120.91529083251953
13099/28840	Dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was	29.679906845092773

13113/28840	A piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the	72.69745635986328

13116/28840	With the first light Dantès resumed his	66.77108764648438
13117/28840	This done he impatiently awaited the return of his	92.4659194946289
13118/28840	On the sixth day the smugglers	336.07318115234375
13119/28840	He then inquired how they had fared in their	224.07603454589844
13120/28840	To this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guardship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards	131.85696411132812
13121/28840	This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of Dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so	66.35542297363281

13123/28840	Arrived at Leghorn he repaired to the house of a Jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs	73.38178253173828
13124/28840	Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per	89.8080825805664
13125/28840	The superior education of Dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its	63.85526657104492
13126/28840	The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles with directions from Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Crist	32.988243103027344
13127/28840	To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future	52.10558319091797

13129/28840	The builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day Dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be	78.6809310913086
13130/28840	0313m       Two hours afterward Dantès sailed from the port of Genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own	39.952842712402344
13131/28840	But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the	68.48347473144531
13132/28840	The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable	120.48306274414062
13133/28840	Some insisted she was making for Corsica others the Island of Elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of Monte Crist	101.21627044677734
13134/28840	Yet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a firstclass sailor and had come the distance from Genoa in thirtyfive	57.616153717041016
13135/28840	Dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little	51.31252670288086
13136/28840	The island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left	80.00076293945312
13137/28840	Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret	65.36964416503906
13138/28840	The former Dantès proposed to augment the latter to	81.71322631835938
13139/28840	Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Crist	102.41454315185547
13140/28840	As it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacop	62.85002517700195
13141/28840	His signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the	132.81370544433594
13142/28840	A mournful answer awaited each of Edmonds eager inquiries as to the information Jacopo had	138.4522247314453
13143/28840	Old Dantès was dead and Mercédès had	12.832196235656738
13144/28840	Dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite	44.66196823120117

13147/28840	For his fathers death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercédè	38.80619430541992
13148/28840	Without divulging his secret Dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an	86.79240417480469
13149/28840	There were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to	84.35541534423828
13150/28840	His lookingglass had assured him during his stay at Leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought	103.99130249023438
13151/28840	The first person to attract the attention of Dantès as he landed on the Canebière was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon	24.431743621826172
13152/28840	Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own	112.2992935180664
13153/28840	Going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then convers	69.92976379394531
13154/28840	Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility Dantès proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to	48.736480712890625

13157/28840	So extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank Edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless aston	81.50752258300781
13158/28840	Some nabob from India was his	414.94354248046875
13159/28840	Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished	146.01296997070312
13160/28840	And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was	27.65760612487793
13161/28840	Recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had	37.664974212646484
13162/28840	The nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the	50.304710388183594
13163/28840	Leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little	89.44758605957031
13164/28840	Then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be	93.02469635009766
13165/28840	The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them Dantès sighed	93.68079376220703
13166/28840	0317m       When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to	46.23911666870117
13167/28840	The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of Dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds	49.09864044189453
13168/28840	that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present	114.23170471191406

13170/28840	But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishingboat with two seines and a	118.55306243896484
13171/28840	This modern place of entertainment stood on the lefthand side of the post road and backed upon the Rhô	96.89739990234375
13172/28840	It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of	70.67166900634766

13183/28840	At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentrylike watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at	84.03623962402344
13184/28840	The horse was of Hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy	177.78643798828125
13185/28840	His rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapid	73.08698272705078
13186/28840	Having arrived before the Pont du Gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to	63.030757904052734

13188/28840	At this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to	103.60810089111328
13189/28840	At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to	75.31714630126953

13193/28840	Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain Caderousse hastily exclaimed A thousand pardons I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor	58.07086944580078
13194/28840	What would the abbé please to have What refreshment can I offer All I have is at his	142.47894287109375
13195/28840	Caderousse   Yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it I am Gaspard Caderousse at your	44.47385025024414

13198/28840	It is so hot at Marseilles that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing	167.3205108642578
13199/28840	But talking of heat is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment   Yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left	72.7157974243164
13200/28840	Are you quite alone inquired the guest as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a	57.34964370727539
13201/28840	Ah sir said Caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being	28.350849151611328

13204/28840	Such words as those belong to your profession answered Caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one ple	65.4436264038086
13205/28840	You are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps I may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in	39.90121841430664
13206/28840	What mean you inquired Caderousse with a look of	28.47328758239746
13207/28840	In the first place I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in search	31.213226318359375
13208/28840	You remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Ed	71.59721374511719
13209/28840	Said to bear the name repeated Caderousse becoming excited and	162.41079711914062
13210/28840	A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his	32.67867660522461
13211/28840	Well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked	113.37841796875

13213/28840	And so I did replied Caderousse though once I confess I envied him his good	85.80635833740234
13214/28840	But I swear to you sir I swear to you by everything a man holds dear I have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy	87.88980102539062
13215/28840	There was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the inn	34.38149642944336
13216/28840	You knew the poor lad then continued Cader	54.0280647277832
13217/28840	I was called to see him on his dying bed that I might administer to him the consolations of	77.53001403808594
13218/28840	And of what did he die asked Caderousse in a choking	29.589271545410156
13219/28840	Of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his	85.64019775390625
13220/28840	How should he have been otherwise Ah sir the poor fellow told you the	151.2093505859375
13221/28840	And for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on	76.77674865722656
13222/28840	And here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Cader	52.40561294555664
13223/28840	Then I suppose asked Caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value   Why everything is relative answered the abb	51.33885955810547
13224/28840	To one in Edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great	170.7981414794922
13225/28840	It was estimated at fifty thousand franc	76.84223937988281
13226/28840	Bless me exclaimed Caderousse fifty thousand francs Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all	78.27528381347656
13227/28840	No replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for	34.026737213134766
13228/28840	The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the	63.42852783203125
13229/28840	Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable work	56.962528228759766
13230/28840	But how comes the diamond in your possession sir Did Edmond make you his heir   No merely his testamentary execut	115.03395080566406
13231/28840	I once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed he said and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my	113.43865203857422
13232/28840	The name of one of the four friends is Cader	35.92621994018555
13233/28840	Another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse is called Danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for	35.32587432861328
13234/28840	A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbés speech when the latter waving his hand said Allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so	48.9163703918457
13235/28840	The third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was Fernand that of my betrothed wasStay stay continued the abbé I have forgotten what he called	63.68073272705078
13236/28840	True said the abbé with a stifled sigh Mercédès it	8.307522773742676
13237/28840	Bring me a _carafe_ of water said the abb	23.864452362060547
13238/28840	You will go to Marseilles said Dantèsfor you understand I repeat his words just as he uttered	42.055233001708984
13239/28840	You will sell this diamond you will divide the money into five equal parts and give an equal portion to these good friends the only persons who have loved me upon	149.7178955078125
13240/28840	But why into five parts asked Caderousse you only mentioned four	225.40744018554688
13241/28840	Because the fifth is dead as I	399.0887756347656
13242/28840	The fifth sharer in Edmonds bequest was his own	306.2608642578125
13243/28840	Too true too true ejaculated Caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did	52.3448486328125
13244/28840	I learned so much at Marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dantès I was unable to obtain any particulars of his	37.179168701171875
13245/28840	Can you enlighten me on that point   I do not know who could if I could not said Cader	27.75212860107422
13246/28840	Why I lived almost on the same floor with the poor old	51.664039611816406
13247/28840	Ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man	80.10142517089844
13248/28840	Of what did he die   Why the doctors called his complaint gastroenteritis I believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but I who saw him in his dying moments I say he died of   Caderousse	55.719539642333984
13249/28840	Of what asked the priest anxiously and	182.5607147216797
13250/28840	Starvation exclaimed the abbé springing from his	36.231998443603516
13251/28840	Why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as	108.09733581542969
13252/28840	Oh it is impossibleutterly impossible   What I have said I have said answered Cader	30.802398681640625
13253/28840	And you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the	50.82080841064453
13254/28840	Mind your own business wife replied Caderousse	215.63796997070312
13255/28840	This gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to	115.6136703491211
13256/28840	What have you to do with politeness I should like to know Better study a little common prud	60.37481689453125
13257/28840	Ah thats all very fine retorted the	118.10128021240234
13258/28840	Nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy I beg of	128.0701446533203
13259/28840	Whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that I solemnly promise	88.88948822021484
13260/28840	La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they	62.627899169921875
13261/28840	Again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower	75.09455108642578
13262/28840	When he had sufficiently recovered himself he said It appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by	100.8614273071289
13263/28840	Surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a	90.92353057861328
13264/28840	And was he not so asked the abb	33.50135803222656
13265/28840	Poor Edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his	64.66854095458984
13266/28840	And whatever people may say continued Caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry I cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the	73.22061920166016
13267/28840	Do you then know in what manner Fernand injured Dantès inquired the abbé of Cader	30.845088958740234
13268/28840	Speak out then say what it was   Gaspard cried La Carconte do as you will you are masterbut if you take my advice youll hold your	71.34056091308594
13269/28840	Well wife replied Caderousse I dont know but what youre right   So you will say nothing asked the abb	31.265182495117188
13270/28840	Why what good would it do asked Cader	101.6468276977539
13271/28840	If the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps I should not	121.77621459960938
13272/28840	But you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with	100.17057037353516
13273/28840	You prefer then said the abbé that I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship   That is true enough returned Cader	60.16804122924805
13274/28840	You say truly the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars besides what would it be to them no more than a drop of water in the	51.86787033081055
13275/28840	Remember chimed in La Carconte those two could crush you at a single blow   How so inquired the abb	55.708438873291016
13276/28840	Are these persons then so rich and powerful   Do you not know their history   I do	39.28379821777344
13277/28840	Pray relate it to me   Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said No truly it would take up too much	57.1418342590332
13278/28840	I shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can and fulfil my promise to the dying	41.72804641723633
13279/28840	My first business will be to dispose of this	115.96935272216797
13280/28840	So saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Cader	37.332881927490234
13281/28840	It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès to be sold and the money divided between his father Mercédès his betrothed bride Fernand Danglars and	41.835723876953125
13282/28840	The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand franc	51.35515213012695
13283/28840	Oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished	316.4930725097656
13284/28840	The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked Cader	77.16903686523438
13285/28840	It does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four	41.805782318115234
13286/28840	And why among us four inquired Cader	101.77665710449219
13287/28840	As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to	116.66838073730469
13288/28840	I dont call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering	82.91596221923828
13289/28840	Of course not rejoined Caderousse quickly no more do I and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just	88.35517120361328
13290/28840	I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps	147.86740112304688
13291/28840	Remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that I do	56.2563362121582
13292/28840	You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars in order that I may execute Edmonds last	45.41972732543945
13293/28840	The agitation of Caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated	70.36063385009766
13294/28840	As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep	46.94584655761719
13295/28840	For my part I wash my hands of the	92.93487548828125
13296/28840	So saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the	60.15501403808594
13297/28840	Arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband Gaspard consider well what you are about to do   I have both reflected and decided answered	76.05590057373047
13298/28840	La Carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though	71.8415298461914
13299/28840	Well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do   To tell you all I know was the	28.983394622802734
13300/28840	I certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the	165.86798095703125
13301/28840	Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is	58.49951171875
13302/28840	I hope it may be so replied Caderousse his face flushed with cup	28.880388259887695
13303/28840	I am all attention said the abb	36.65454864501953
13304/28840	Stop a minute answered Caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to	66.77054595947266
13305/28840	With these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at	51.360984802246094
13306/28840	During this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his	49.66780090332031
13307/28840	Remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of La Carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting	57.370025634765625
13308/28840	Enough enough replied Caderousse say no more about it I will take all the consequences upon	55.44697189331055
13309/28840	The Story   First sir said Caderousse you must make me a	32.23710632324219
13310/28840	Make yourself easy my friend replied the abb	28.208234786987305
13311/28840	I am a priest and confessions die in my	72.18873596191406
13312/28840	Recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our	99.93802642822266
13313/28840	This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little	146.3523712158203
13314/28840	Well then under these circumstances said Caderousse I will I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestion	66.85784149169922
13315/28840	Begin with his father if you	48.51532745361328
13316/28840	said the abbé Edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest	41.77532958984375
13317/28840	The history is a sad one sir said Caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it  	36.21351623535156
13318/28840	answered the abbé Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marse	27.276512145996094
13319/28840	At La Réserve Oh yes I can see it all before me this	46.91878890991211
13320/28840	Was it not his betrothal feast   It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and Dantès was	50.46355056762695
13321/28840	Yes and up to this point I know all said the	99.30860900878906
13322/28840	Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you or heard mention of anyone of	111.60452270507812
13323/28840	Well when Dantès was arrested Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very	29.120512008666992
13324/28840	The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of	31.94622802734375
13325/28840	But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb	31.653507232666016
13326/28840	Ah sir replied Caderousse we cannot console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides I know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing	48.781436920166016
13327/28840	One night however I heard his sobs and I could not resist my desire to go up to him but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but	58.2103157043457
13328/28840	From day to day he lived on alone and more and more	193.14378356933594
13329/28840	Morrel and Mercédès came to see him but his door was closed and although I was certain he was at home he would not make any	29.503604888916016
13330/28840	At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to	87.46190643310547
13331/28840	I know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left	92.67630004882812
13332/28840	For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth I heard	97.19847869873047
13333/28840	I then resolved to go up to him at all	35.47701644897461
13334/28840	The door was closed but I looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill I went and told	94.48597717285156
13335/28840	Morrel and then ran on to Mercédè	29.674699783325195
13336/28840	Morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited	99.70751953125
13337/28840	I was there too and I never shall forget the old mans smile at this	85.344482421875
13338/28840	From that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a	118.06912994384766
13339/28840	The abbé uttered a kind of gro	25.82240867614746
13340/28840	The story interests you does it not sir inquired Cader	93.77947998046875
13341/28840	Yes replied the abbé it is very	16.022083282470703
13342/28840	Mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own	45.239742279052734
13343/28840	Morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually	85.90093231201172
13344/28840	Mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and	29.4077091217041
13345/28840	The abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched	75.97390747070312
13346/28840	And you believe he died   Of hunger sir of hunger said Cader	58.94261169433594
13347/28840	I am as certain of it as that we two are	109.60016632080078
13348/28840	The abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him halffull swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale	63.71772766113281
13349/28840	This was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse	34.6718864440918

13351/28840	Tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me	47.748661041259766
13352/28840	Tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine   Two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionFernand and Dangl	97.42933654785156
13353/28840	How was this jealousy manifested Speak	1276.978759765625
13354/28840	They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist	35.6773567199707
13355/28840	Which of the two denounced him Which was the real delinquent   Both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the	86.484130859375
13356/28840	And where was this letter written   At La Réserve the day before the betrothal	27.978261947631836
13357/28840	Twas so thentwas so then murmured the abb	135.62550354003906
13358/28840	Oh Faria Faria how well did you judge men and things   What did you please to say sir asked Cader	60.40142822265625
13359/28840	Nothing nothing replied the priest go	118.31473541259766
13360/28840	It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and Fernand who put it in the	51.01528549194336
13361/28840	But exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there	50.81941223144531
13362/28840	I said Caderousse astonished who told you I was there   The abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quicklyNo one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an	59.2762451171875
13363/28840	True true said Caderousse in a choking voice I was	22.634841918945312
13364/28840	And did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbé if not you were an accompl	41.52702331542969
13365/28840	Sir replied Caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that I nearly lost all	71.85163879394531
13366/28840	I had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around	69.14360809326172
13367/28840	I said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly	63.39508819580078
13368/28840	Next daynext day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when Dantès was	91.48101043701172
13369/28840	Yes sir I was there and very anxious to speak but Danglars restrained	34.60728073120117

13373/28840	Yes sir answered Caderousse and remorse preys on me night and	156.7945556640625
13374/28840	I often ask pardon of God I swear to you because this action the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject	56.28418731689453
13375/28840	I am expiating a moment of selfishness and so I always say to La Carconte when she complains Hold your tongue woman it is the will of	51.28306579589844
13376/28840	And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real	80.59927368164062
13377/28840	Well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve	49.697261810302734
13378/28840	Unfortunately Edmond is dead and has not pardoned	36.42516326904297
13379/28840	He did not know said the abb	13.403392791748047
13380/28840	But he knows it all now interrupted Caderousse they say the dead know	140.58184814453125
13381/28840	There was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his	27.749462127685547
13382/28840	You have two or three times mentioned a	159.49427795410156

13384/28840	And what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abb	62.95041275024414
13385/28840	The part of an honest man full of courage and real	86.91358184814453

13388/28840	Morrel still alive   Yes replied Cader	19.271451950073242
13389/28840	In that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of God rich	62.92988204956055
13390/28840	He is reduced almost to the last extremitynay he is almost at the point of dishon	50.110843658447266
13391/28840	How   Yes continued Caderousse so it is after fiveandtwenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles	34.70634460449219
13392/28840	If this ship founders like the others he is a ruined	58.941322326660156
13393/28840	And has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abb	102.55950164794922
13394/28840	If he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an	40.21997833251953
13395/28840	And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added Cader	92.26531219482422
13396/28840	How is that   Because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to	118.23883056640625
13397/28840	What has become of Danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty   What has become of him Why he left Marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of	35.96135711669922

13400/28840	Ah said the abbé in a peculiar tone he is	23.18208885192871
13401/28840	Happy Who can answer for that Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to ones self and the wallswalls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness Danglars is	101.65506744384766
13402/28840	And Fernand   Fernand Why much the same	123.74015808105469
13403/28840	But how could a poor Catalan fisherboy without education or resources make a fortune I confess this staggers	139.59622192382812
13404/28840	There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one	64.46171569824219
13405/28840	But then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position   Both sirhe has both fortune and position	265.1477966308594
13406/28840	This must be impossible   It would seem so but listen and you will	59.678260803222656
13407/28840	Some days before the return of the emperor Fernand was	125.20575714111328
13408/28840	The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans but Napoleon returned a special levy was made and Fernand was compelled to	116.13597869873047
13409/28840	I went too but as I was older than Fernand and had just married my poor wife I was only sent to the	70.38560485839844

13411/28840	The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the	72.72918701171875
13412/28840	That same night the general was to go over to the	102.75749969482422
13413/28840	He proposed to Fernand to accompany him Fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the	177.11627197265625
13414/28840	Fernand would have been courtmartialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the Bour	58.63648986816406
13415/28840	Yes but listen this was not	117.997314453125
13416/28840	The war with Spain being ended Fernands career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout	223.4820098876953
13417/28840	Greece only had risen against Turkey and had begun her war of independence all eyes were turned towards Athensit was the fashion to pity and support the	207.36050415039062
13418/28840	The French government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer	271.3205871582031
13419/28840	Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece still having his name kept on the army	300.4064025878906

13421/28840	Ali Pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to France when he was gazetted lieutenant	96.3442153930664
13422/28840	So that now continued Caderousse he owns a magnificent house	80.8886489868164
13423/28840	Has she made a fortune also inquired the abbé with an ironical	42.37142562866211
13424/28840	Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris replied Cader	13.647517204284668
13425/28840	Go on said the abbé it seems as if I were listening to the story of a	32.278926849365234
13426/28840	But I have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise	125.02767181396484
13427/28840	Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Ed	32.55366516113281
13428/28840	I have told you of her attempts to propitiate	52.51112365722656
13429/28840	de Villefort her devotion to the elder Dantè	18.99635887145996
13430/28840	In the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook	93.8582534790039
13431/28840	This was the departure of Fernandof Fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her	95.66563415527344
13432/28840	Three months passed and still she weptno news of Edmond no news of Fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with	128.73580932617188
13433/28840	One evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans she returned to her home more depressed than	57.22579574584961
13434/28840	Suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and Fernand dressed in the uniform of a sublieutenant stood before	59.547245025634766
13435/28840	It was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to	64.93603515625
13436/28840	Mercédès seized Fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary	77.30187225341797
13437/28840	And then it must be confessed Fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely	211.38601684570312
13438/28840	Another possessed all Mercédès heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was	131.60763549804688
13439/28840	The old man died as I have told you had he lived Mercédès perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her inf	38.89918518066406
13440/28840	Fernand saw this and when he learned of the old mans death he	86.64569091796875
13441/28840	At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès at the second he reminded her that he loved	51.72437286376953
13442/28840	Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Ed	74.23284149169922
13443/28840	So that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in	22.226831436157227
13444/28840	What more could the most devoted lover desire Then he murmured the words of the English poet Frailty thy name is	93.75336456298828
13445/28840	Six months afterwards continued Caderousse the marriage took place in the church of Accou	50.706180572509766
13446/28840	The very church in which she was to have married Edmond murmured the priest there was only a change of brideg	66.8694076538086
13447/28840	Fernand more happy but not more at his easefor I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmonds returnFernand was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart	85.8169174194336
13448/28840	There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans and eight days after the wedding they left Marse	76.04059600830078
13449/28840	Did you ever see Mercédès again inquired the	25.929859161376953
13450/28840	Yes during the Spanish war at Perpignan where Fernand had left her she was attending to the education of her	85.04885864257812
13451/28840	But then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education	65.42399597167969
13452/28840	I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but un	75.20896911621094
13453/28840	Oh replied Caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed Mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most	37.055877685546875
13454/28840	Fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing	361.60467529296875
13455/28840	Besides I believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her	96.5462417602539
13456/28840	But now her position in life is assured continued Caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet   Caderousse	99.3412857055664
13457/28840	Yet I am sure she is not happy said Cader	28.224943161010742
13458/28840	What makes you believe this   Why when I found myself utterly destitute I thought my old friends would perhaps assist	69.97869873046875
13459/28840	So I went to Danglars who would not even receive	26.791667938232422
13460/28840	I called on Fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valetdechamb	26.308103561401367
13461/28840	Then you did not see either of them   No but Madame de Morcerf saw	29.148101806640625
13462/28840	How was that   As I went away a purse fell at my feetit contained fiveandtwenty louis I raised my head quickly and saw Mercédès who at once shut the	46.28272247314453
13463/28840	Oh he never was a friend of mine I did not know him and I had nothing to ask of	29.80035400390625
13464/28840	I only as you see have remained poor wretched and	341.22430419921875
13465/28840	What for me only cried Caderousse ah sir do not jest with me   This diamond was to have been shared among his	59.838600158691406
13466/28840	Edmond had one friend only and thus it cannot be	292.3268737792969
13467/28840	Take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretched	59.76739501953125
13468/28840	I know what happiness and what despair are and I never make a jest of such	119.48402404785156
13469/28840	Take it then but in exchange   Caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his	76.80791473388672
13470/28840	In exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that	228.51242065429688

13472/28840	Caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been g	66.40182495117188
13473/28840	The abbé took it and in return gave Caderousse the	59.98481369018555
13474/28840	Oh you are a man of God sir cried Caderousse for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept	37.8121452331543
13475/28840	Which said the abbé to himself you would have	24.332223892211914
13476/28840	The abbé rose took his hat and	56.55607223510742
13477/28840	Well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and I may believe it in every	59.19548797607422
13478/28840	See sir replied Caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy woodhere on this shelf is my wifes testament open this book and I will swear upon it with my hand on the	54.39243698120117
13479/28840	Tis well and may this money profit you Adieu I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each	171.5889129638672
13480/28840	When Caderousse turned around he saw behind him La Carconte paler and trembling more than	31.89935874938965
13481/28840	Is then all that I have heard really true she	131.2584991455078
13482/28840	What That he has given the diamond to us only inquired Caderousse half bewildered with joy yes nothing more true See here it	102.9388656616211
13483/28840	The woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice Suppose its false   Caderousse started and turned	68.63402557373047
13484/28840	False Why should that man give me a false diamond   0349m       To get your secret without paying for it you blockhead   Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an	33.08454132080078
13485/28840	Oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find	27.01443099975586

13487/28840	Look after the house wife and I shall be back in two hours and Caderousse left the house in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had	62.59577178955078
13488/28840	Fifty thousand francs muttered La Carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a	42.57588195800781
13489/28840	Sir said he I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson  French of	36.89033889770508
13490/28840	We are and have been these ten years connected with the house of Morrel  Son of Marse	41.273193359375
13491/28840	We have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of	72.01692962646484
13492/28840	I have come therefore express from Rome to ask you for	115.439208984375
13493/28840	I know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue	50.48166275024414
13494/28840	He has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his	42.60793685913086
13495/28840	Ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of	100.6170654296875
13496/28840	Morrel and I shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punct	70.96903991699219
13497/28840	This is all I can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to	48.93540954589844

13499/28840	15 Rue de Nouailles he has I believe two hundred thousand francs in Morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than	59.392784118652344
13500/28840	The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards the street	83.43269348144531
13501/28840	de Boville was in his private room and the Englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his	22.710643768310547
13502/28840	de Boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the	44.75019836425781
13503/28840	The Englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of Marse	46.50316619873047
13504/28840	de Boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in	85.11595916748047
13505/28840	But said the Englishman this looks very much like a suspension of	93.01405334472656
13506/28840	It looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed	573.123291015625
13507/28840	The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said From which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension   To tell you the truth I consider it	74.66548156738281
13508/28840	Well then I will buy it of you   You   Yes I   But at a tremendous discount of course   No for two hundred thousand franc	26.048921585083008
13509/28840	Our house added the Englishman with a laugh does not do things in that	56.34549331665039

13522/28840	To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners   There are special reports on every	177.11483764648438
13523/28840	Well sir I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared	66.12152862548828
13524/28840	I have since learned that he was confined in the Château dIf and I should like to learn some particulars of his	19.57217025756836
13525/28840	What was his name   The Abbé Far	11.810043334960938
13526/28840	Oh I recollect him perfectly cried	111.9862060546875
13527/28840	Very possibly but what sort of madness was it   He pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate	68.744140625
13528/28840	Poor deviland he is dead   Yes sir five or six months ago last	71.42024230957031
13529/28840	You have a good memory sir to recollect dates so	98.13661193847656
13530/28840	I recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular	61.57024383544922
13531/28840	May I ask what that was said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic count	47.48855209350586
13532/28840	de Boville I myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of	63.68498229980469
13533/28840	That man made a deep impression on me I shall never forget his countenance   20025m       The Englishman smiled impercept	16.936864852905273
13534/28840	And you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons   Were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this Edmond Dantès   This dangerous mans name was   Edmond Dantè	28.366256713867188
13535/28840	It appears sir that this Edmond Dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one	60.222633361816406
13536/28840	This tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape   No doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the Abbé Faria had an attack of catalepsy and	47.03718948364258
13537/28840	That must have cut short the projects of	214.99742126464844
13538/28840	For the dead man yes replied	345.29034423828125
13539/28840	de Boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his	38.13151168823242
13540/28840	It was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the English	175.0151824951172
13541/28840	As I have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his	33.469383239746094
13542/28840	How was that   How Do you not comprehend  	37.964019775390625
13543/28840	The Château dIf has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirtysixpound cannonball to their	42.455711364746094
13544/28840	Well observed the Englishman as if he were slow of	62.692317962646484
13545/28840	Well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the	33.35400390625
13546/28840	Yes sir continued the inspector of	33.372928619384766
13547/28840	You may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks I should like to have seen his face at that	48.34765625
13548/28840	No matter replied De Boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francsno matter I can fancy	63.820350646972656
13549/28840	So can I said the Englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the English do at the end of his	68.38105010986328
13550/28840	And so continued the Englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned   Unquestion	74.65593719482422
13551/28840	So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time   Precise	38.171836853027344
13552/28840	20027m       But some official document was drawn up as to this affair I suppose inquired the English	42.959712982177734
13553/28840	You understand Dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or	47.16756057739258
13554/28840	So that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy	109.48509216308594
13555/28840	He is dead and no mistake about	104.38461303710938
13556/28840	Oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they	135.6204376220703
13557/28840	True this story has diverted our attention from	179.79379272460938
13558/28840	Excuse you for what For the story By no means it really seems to me very	157.58877563476562
13559/28840	So sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness	51.22201156616211
13560/28840	Go into my study here and I will show it to	44.20841598510742
13561/28840	Everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its	321.10760498046875
13562/28840	There he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination Morrels petition	141.5653076171875
13563/28840	Then he saw through the whole	176.0519561767578
13564/28840	This petition to Napoleon kept back by Villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the kings	63.29088592529297
13565/28840	He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name   Edmond Dantè	46.441410064697266
13566/28840	An inveterate Bonapartist took an active part in the return from the Island of El	57.90126419067383
13567/28840	To be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and	219.22959899902344
13568/28840	Beneath these lines was written in another hand See note abovenothing can be	514.2618408203125
13569/28840	He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say was in Villeforts	64.81700134277344
13570/28840	As we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the Abbé Farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading _Le Drapeau Blanc	34.02307891845703
13571/28840	He did not see the Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by Danglars under the arbor of La Réserve and which had the postmark Marseilles 27th February delivery 6 oclock	35.023399353027344
13572/28840	But it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do however irregular it might	49.77109909057617
13573/28840	Thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam I have all I want now it is for me to perform my	64.37699127197266
13574/28840	Give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and I will hand you over the	122.39073181152344
13575/28840	He rose gave his seat to	181.82659912109375

13577/28840	The House of Morrel  Son   Anyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of Morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great	40.7047233581543
13578/28840	Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two	165.85731506347656
13579/28840	One was a young man of three or fourandtwenty who was in love with	29.326580047607422
13580/28840	Morrels service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a	43.21317672729492
13581/28840	He was however the same Cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against	106.90869140625
13582/28840	Morrel and strong in the multiplicationtable which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch	113.82688903808594
13583/28840	In the midst of the disasters that befell the house Cocles was the only one unm	58.20542907714844
13584/28840	But this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm	115.3966064453125
13585/28840	Like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the	113.0264663696289
13586/28840	Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their	97.8669662475586
13587/28840	Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude Cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to	83.881591796875
13588/28840	Morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying   Thanks Cocles you are the pearl of cash	72.16674041748047
13589/28840	Cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of	144.4959259033203
13590/28840	Morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crown	72.65836334228516
13591/28840	But since the end of the month	45.06842041015625
13592/28840	Morrel had passed many an anxious	374.0173034667969
13593/28840	By this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now	127.57134246826172
13594/28840	Credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to	37.57708740234375
13595/28840	Morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the _Pharaon_ of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in	36.240577697753906
13596/28840	But this vessel which like the _Pharaon_ came from Calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the _Pharaon	26.696374893188477
13597/28840	20033m       Such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with	34.602542877197266
13598/28840	de Boville the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French of Rome presented himself at	25.91775894165039
13599/28840	Emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the	66.68902587890625
13600/28840	The young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the newcomer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to	78.20652770996094
13601/28840	Emmanuel and that his business was with	51.073883056640625
13602/28840	Cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to	65.7090072631836
13603/28840	Cocles went first and the stranger followed	134.32431030273438
13604/28840	On the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the	147.5146484375
13605/28840	Morrel is in his room is he not Mademoiselle Julie said the cash	29.60243034362793
13606/28840	Yes I think so at least said the young girl hesitating	20.700529098510742
13607/28840	Go and see Cocles and if my father is there announce this	107.56690216064453
13608/28840	It will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the English	30.71842384338379
13609/28840	Morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French of Rome with whom your father does	54.523468017578125
13610/28840	The young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and Cocles continued to mount the	63.64399719238281
13611/28840	The Englishman entered and found Morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his	59.50975036621094
13612/28840	At the sight of the stranger	123.6392593383789
13613/28840	Morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own	69.85511016845703
13614/28840	The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with	29.2890567779541
13615/28840	The house of Thomson  French had 300000 or 400000 francs to pay this month in France and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money	77.369140625
13616/28840	Morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with pers	27.14748191833496
13617/28840	So then sir said Morrel you hold bills of mine   Yes and for a considerable	52.75447463989258
13618/28840	What is the amount asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render	52.75531005859375
13619/28840	20035m       Here is said the Englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of 200000 francs to our house by	28.753833770751953
13620/28840	de Boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are	43.01228713989258
13621/28840	You acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him   Yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years	65.60211944580078
13622/28840	When are you to pay   Half the 15th of this month half the 15th of	62.40200424194336
13623/28840	Just so and now here are 32500 francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the	67.83806610107422
13624/28840	I recognize them said Morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own	39.009620666503906
13625/28840	It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumer	115.1351547241211
13626/28840	Two hundred and eightyseven thousand five hundred francs repeated	92.04743957519531
13627/28840	I will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your	85.20387268066406
13628/28840	At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly	282.1228332519531
13629/28840	But as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality   Morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto	47.0536003112793
13630/28840	To questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be	419.35260009765625
13631/28840	Well said the other if this last resource fail you   Well returned Morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune I must habituate myself to	54.729549407958984
13632/28840	I fear I shall be forced to suspend	80.8940200805664
13633/28840	Have you no friends who could assist you   Morrel smiled mourn	81.57696533203125
13634/28840	In business sir said he one has no friends only correspond	162.5549774169922
13635/28840	It is true murmured the Englishman then you have but one	51.8261833190918
13636/28840	So that if this fail   I am ruinedcompletely ruined   As I was on my way here a vessel was coming into	52.98118591308594
13637/28840	And it is not yours   No she is a Bordeaux vessel _La Gironde_ she comes from India also but she is not	56.10334396362305
13638/28840	Perhaps she has spoken to the _Pharaon_ and brings you some tidings of her   Shall I tell you plainly one thing sir I dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in	43.24331283569336
13639/28840	Then in a low voice Morrel addedThis delay is not	56.10340118408203
13640/28840	The _Pharaon_ left Calcutta the 5th of February she ought to have been here a month	26.173303604125977
13641/28840	What is the meaning of that noise   Oh my God cried Morrel turning pale what is it   A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled so	41.74850845336914
13642/28840	Morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a	34.80946350097656

13644/28840	The noise had ceased but it seemed that Morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must	108.87462615966797
13645/28840	The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the	49.5240478515625
13646/28840	A key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was	63.403221130371094
13647/28840	There are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured Morrel Cocles and	76.06330108642578
13648/28840	At this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears	37.261592864990234
13649/28840	Morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the	69.54144287109375
13650/28840	He would have spoken but his voice failed	111.27262115478516

13653/28840	The young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fathers	57.856441497802734

13659/28840	Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping	90.54378509521484
13660/28840	Emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight halfnaked	77.75837707519531
13661/28840	At the sight of these men the Englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the	60.847530364990234

13682/28840	We did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our topsails and scudded under bare	74.95367431640625
13683/28840	The vessel was very old to risk that said the English	150.8199920654297

13696/28840	Morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say Get alongsave	84.84600067138672
13697/28840	We soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into	174.7830810546875
13698/28840	The captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so I took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then I jumped after	91.92010498046875

13706/28840	Cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said Mor	66.93743133544922
13707/28840	At another time added he I should have said Give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this	116.17668914794922
13708/28840	Penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with	31.896591186523438

13712/28840	These last words produced a prodigious effect on the se	77.62189483642578
13713/28840	Penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he	141.51380920410156
13714/28840	Morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us   No no said	39.06981658935547
13715/28840	Morrel I am not angry quite the contrary and I do not send you away but I have no more ships and therefore I do not want any	56.10527420043945
13716/28840	No more ships returned Penelon well then youll build some well wait for	130.10748291015625
13717/28840	I have no money to build ships with Penelon said the poor owner mournfully so I cannot accept your kind	90.83802795410156

13723/28840	Now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me I wish to speak with this	53.738563537597656
13724/28840	20045m       And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson  French who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have	34.12316131591797
13725/28840	The two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment Julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern	74.14359283447266
13726/28840	Well sir said Morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and I have nothing further to tell	37.744503021240234
13727/28840	I see returned the Englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve	93.63040924072266
13728/28840	Let me see continued the stranger I am one of your largest	54.62153244018555
13729/28840	Your bills at least are the first that will fall	255.8450164794922
13730/28840	Do you wish for time to pay   A delay would save my honor and consequently my	85.8099594116211
13731/28840	How long a delay do you wish for   Morrel	86.02049255371094
13732/28840	I will give you three replied the	64.38822937011719
13733/28840	But asked Morrel will the house of Thomson  French consent   Oh I take everything on	49.55234909057617
13734/28840	Well renew these bills up to the 5th of September and on the 5th of September at eleven oclock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven I shall come to receive the	40.82381057739258
13735/28840	I shall expect you returned Morrel and I will pay youor I shall be	67.27446746826172
13736/28840	These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear	52.93704605102539
13737/28840	The bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor shipowner found himself with three months before him to collect his	94.0458755493164
13738/28840	The Englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and Morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the	71.36785125732422
13739/28840	The stranger met Julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for	74.78669738769531
13740/28840	Mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed Sinbad the	23.332918167114258
13741/28840	Do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may	136.2049560546875

13744/28840	Julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the bal	81.38301086425781
13745/28840	The stranger waved his hand and continued to	99.4408187866211
13746/28840	In the court he found Penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain	60.952911376953125
13747/28840	Come with me my friend said the Englishman I wish to speak to	18.86442756652832
13748/28840	The same day he told his wife Emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the	79.48883056640625
13749/28840	Unfortunately however Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson  French who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not	65.43407440185547
13750/28840	Unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all Morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary	158.35899353027344
13751/28840	The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman were paid by Cocles with equal punct	86.78962707519531
13752/28840	Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquill	146.54811096191406
13753/28840	It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50000 francs of	60.11647415161133
13754/28840	de Boville and on the 30th the 32500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined	63.58069610595703
13755/28840	The opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down Morrel it was impossible for him to remain	62.308902740478516
13756/28840	Great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punct	39.61369705200195
13757/28840	Still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the	74.99950408935547
13758/28840	The month passed and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his	206.69227600097656
13759/28840	Formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in	237.0231475830078
13760/28840	Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him	150.17349243164062
13761/28840	Fortunately Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July	74.49197387695312
13762/28840	The agent of Thomson  French had not been again seen at Marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to Morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and	49.41905212402344
13763/28840	Morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three	210.61912536621094
13764/28840	As to the sailors of the _Pharaon_ they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had	26.44615936279297
13765/28840	Captain Gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from Pal	91.12171173095703
13766/28840	He delayed presenting himself at Morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see	86.59026336669922
13767/28840	The worthy shipowner knew from Penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console	102.08242797851562
13768/28840	He brought him also the amount of his wages which Captain Gaumard had not dared to apply	53.625118255615234
13769/28840	As he descended the staircase Morrel met Penelon who was going	41.69254684448242
13770/28840	Penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly	122.85838317871094
13771/28840	Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new	59.446022033691406
13772/28840	But contrary to all expectation when the 31st of August came the house opened as usual and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual	118.96832275390625
13773/28840	There came in moreover two drafts which	459.76910400390625
13774/28840	Morrel had fully anticipated and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had	75.08580780029297
13775/28840	All this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of	119.15151977539062
13776/28840	On the 1st Morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to Paris they hoped great	180.43423461914062
13777/28840	It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited	63.16663360595703
13778/28840	Danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save Morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and Morrel was	48.67496871948242
13779/28840	Morrel had long thought of Danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last	45.780181884765625
13780/28840	And Morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a	82.76132202148438
13781/28840	Yet on his arrival Morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh	165.13233947753906
13782/28840	He embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed Emmanuels hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Coc	96.42901611328125
13783/28840	Then said the two women to Emmanuel we are indeed	162.1090545654297

13791/28840	In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the sto	64.40889739990234

13794/28840	They had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles Julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost constern	85.3923110961914
13795/28840	Morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the	193.3830108642578
13796/28840	All his funds amounted to 6000 or 8000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4000 or 5000 which making the best of everything gave him 14000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287500 franc	73.77132415771484
13797/28840	He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on	118.42259979248047
13798/28840	However when Morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very	66.13679504394531
13799/28840	This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have	73.3661880493164

13801/28840	As to Cocles he seemed completely bewild	65.75887298583984

13805/28840	Night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room Morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his	74.21556854248047
13806/28840	They listened he went into his sleepingroom and fastened the door	81.4706039428711
13807/28840	Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after Julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was	76.10828399658203
13808/28840	In the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was Julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her	146.32452392578125

13817/28840	Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his	73.93751525878906
13818/28840	Julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad o	129.87095642089844
13819/28840	Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment The young girl looked at Mor	82.66946411132812
13820/28840	What have I done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me   Nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple questionnothing only I want	74.73760986328125
13821/28840	Julie made a pretence to feel for the	199.242431640625
13822/28840	I must have left it in my room she	37.52044677734375
13823/28840	And she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult	58.48548126220703
13824/28840	Do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a	68.52470397949219
13825/28840	She questioned Emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he	95.86866760253906
13826/28840	During the night between the 4th and 5th of September Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oclock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great	55.60026550292969
13827/28840	It was three oclock when he threw himself on the	28.023683547973633
13828/28840	The mother and daughter passed the night	267.6734924316406
13829/28840	They had expected Maximilian since the previous	75.28913116455078
13830/28840	At eight oclock in the morning Morrel entered their	27.776824951171875
13831/28840	He was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn vis	71.63754272460938
13832/28840	They did not dare to ask him how he had	71.7710952758789
13833/28840	Morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever	69.85807800292969
13834/28840	He could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet	206.3918914794922

13836/28840	I wish you to do so said	17.73583221435547
13837/28840	This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and Julie did not dare to disob	43.48219299316406
13838/28840	She remained at the same spot standing mute and motion	50.32801818847656
13839/28840	An instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her	119.78939819335938
13840/28840	She looked up and uttered an exclamation of	33.227294921875
13841/28840	20053m       Maximilian my dearest brother she	27.661701202392578
13842/28840	At these words Madame Morrel rose and threw herself into her sons	41.328453063964844
13843/28840	Mother said the young man looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter what has occurredwhat has happened Your letter has frightened me and I have come hither with all	51.918212890625
13844/28840	Julie said Madame Morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that Maximilian has just	35.62696838378906
13845/28840	The young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his	31.746206283569336
13846/28840	Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel inquired the man with a strong Italian	19.783958435058594
13847/28840	Yes sir replied Julie with hesitation what is your pleasure I do not know	38.69142532348633
13848/28840	Read this letter he said handing it to	70.72688293457031
13849/28840	It concerns the best interests of your father said the	58.65444564819336
13850/28840	The young girl hastily took the letter from	65.83492279052734
13851/28840	She opened it quickly and read   Go this moment to the Allées de Meilhan enter the house	40.9027214050293

13854/28840	The young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had	98.678955078125
13855/28840	She cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a post	86.15912628173828
13856/28840	She read   It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and	72.75547790527344
13857/28840	If you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about	68.17733764648438
13858/28840	This postscript decreased greatly the young girls	164.63119506835938
13859/28840	Was there nothing to fear was there not some snare laid for her Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her	113.16258239746094
13860/28840	But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest	79.99088287353516
13861/28840	Julie hesitated and resolved to take	343.9606018066406
13862/28840	Yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to	179.8955841064453
13863/28840	She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson  French had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the	54.290096282958984
13864/28840	You must go then mademoiselle said	30.11045265197754
13865/28840	But did you not read that I must be alone said	85.19676208496094
13866/28840	And you shall be alone replied the young	36.89910125732422
13867/28840	Did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it   But what danger threatens him then Emmanuel she	203.0651092529297
13868/28840	Emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him	154.56512451171875
13869/28840	Listen he said today is the 5th of September is it not  	26.52145004272461
13870/28840	Today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay   Yes we know	28.695175170898438
13871/28840	Well then continued Emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the	42.110084533691406
13872/28840	What will happen then   Why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a	55.682861328125
13873/28840	Oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young	71.16001892089844
13874/28840	During this time Madame Morrel had told her son	75.56578826904297
13875/28840	The young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a	49.13755416870117
13876/28840	Then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in	72.35994720458984
13877/28840	While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his	43.57598114013672
13878/28840	Instead of going direct to his study	167.61573791503906
13879/28840	Morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment	62.72703170776367
13880/28840	Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was	25.902847290039062
13881/28840	He remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his	70.96920776367188
13882/28840	Maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on Morrels	37.825706481933594
13883/28840	Father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat   Oh this is what I feared said Mor	34.42882537841797
13884/28840	Father father in Heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for   Maximilian replied Morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of	29.87782859802246
13885/28840	Come and I will explain to	17.521326065063477
13886/28840	And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study while Maximilian followed him trembling as he	34.38064193725586
13887/28840	Morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open	50.738773345947266
13888/28840	In this ledger was made out an exact balancesheet of his	54.66236114501953
13889/28840	Morrel had to pay within half an hour 287500 franc	43.15568542480469
13890/28840	The young man was overwhelmed as he	122.21489715576172
13891/28840	What could he say What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures   And have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moments	73.93250274658203
13892/28840	You have no money coming in on which you can rely  	94.30004119873047
13893/28840	You have exhausted every resource  	102.12191009521484
13894/28840	And in half an hour said Maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored   Blood washes out dishonor said Mor	49.52421569824219
13895/28840	You are right father I understand	75.37225341796875
13896/28840	Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said There is one for you and one for methanks   Morrel caught his	54.58466339111328
13897/28840	Your motheryour sister Who will support them   A shudder ran through the young mans	109.47245788574219
13898/28840	Father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live   Yes I do so bid you answered Morrel it is your	36.88910675048828
13899/28840	You have a calm strong mind Maximil	132.37371826171875
13900/28840	I make no requests or commands I only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for	66.57121276855469
13901/28840	The young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his	48.557273864746094
13902/28840	Be it so then my father he said extending his hand to Morrel die in peace my father I will	64.79817962646484
13903/28840	Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but Maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a	43.311546325683594
13904/28840	You know it is not my fault said Mor	18.000431060791016

13907/28840	And now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and	52.224491119384766
13908/28840	On seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on	91.26895141601562
13909/28840	To you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to	91.97649383544922

13915/28840	The young man uttered a groan but appeared	112.98739624023438
13916/28840	And now said Morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister	87.88489532470703
13917/28840	Will you not see my sister once more asked Maximil	84.81278991699219
13918/28840	A last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested	87.86441040039062
13919/28840	I saw her this morning and bade her ad	59.73426055908203
13920/28840	Have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired Maximilian in a faltering	49.830047607421875
13921/28840	Yes my son and a sacred	217.27609252929688
13922/28840	The house of Thomson  French is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishnessit is not for me to read mens heartshas had any pity for	74.76045989990234

13927/28840	You will find my will in the secretaire in my	78.84192657470703
13928/28840	The young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of	111.31046295166016
13929/28840	And he rushed out of the	71.77742767333984
13930/28840	When his son had left him Morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the	64.15583038330078
13931/28840	It was no longer the same manthe fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed	84.39396667480469

13933/28840	My worthy Cocles said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antech	34.867767333984375

13935/28840	Cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated	32.50930404663086
13936/28840	Morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was	60.01963424682617
13937/28840	The hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its	103.83788299560547
13938/28840	What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in	88.78324890136719
13939/28840	He was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life	98.23619079589844
13940/28840	To form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to	84.93067932128906
13941/28840	The pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughters	173.84107971191406
13942/28840	Then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few	98.5182113647461
13943/28840	It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved	46.72721481323242
13944/28840	Then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by	493.1570129394531
13945/28840	He took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the	53.4979248046875
13946/28840	At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart	87.94878387451172
13947/28840	He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning to strike eleventhe door of his study	110.6934585571289
13948/28840	Morrel did not turn roundhe expected these words of Cocles The agent of Thomson 	118.06085205078125
13949/28840	He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his	78.56478118896484
13950/28840	Suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters	92.58142852783203
13951/28840	My father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joysaved you are saved And she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk	72.49031829833984

13953/28840	Morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to	70.94840240478516
13954/28840	At one end was the receipted bill for the 287000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment _Julies Dowry	55.430320739746094
13955/28840	Morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a	34.333683013916016
13956/28840	At this moment the clock struck	83.04939270019531
13957/28840	He felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his	106.04400634765625
13958/28840	Explain my child he said Explain my child he said explainwhere did you find this purse   In a house in the Allées de Meilhan	51.7042121887207

13960/28840	But cried Morrel this purse is not yours Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the	78.8760757446289
13961/28840	And did you go alone asked Morrel after he had read	75.2906723022461
13962/28840	He was to have waited for me at the corner of the Rue du Musée but strange to say he was not there when I	34.73161697387695
13963/28840	Monsieur Morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs Monsieur Morrel   It is his voice said	34.750732421875

13976/28840	They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year and that Franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy should act as _cicerone_ to	84.01036834716797

13983/28840	Where   Do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo	77.99238586425781
13984/28840	Well what is this island   The Island of Monte Crist	17.398401260375977
13985/28840	But I have no permission to shoot over this	137.4985809326172

13994/28840	Upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low	77.79605102539062
13995/28840	Well asked he what now Is there any difficulty in the way  	49.059906005859375

14002/28840	Franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward and one at the helmhe resumed the	113.5990982055664
14003/28840	Gaetano said he to the captain you tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the	53.45918655395508
14004/28840	Yes your excellency and it is	20.82030487060547
14005/28840	I knew there were smugglers but I thought that since the capture of Algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of Cooper and Captain Marry	77.5754623413086
14006/28840	Your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo	39.883792877197266
14007/28840	and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of	100.31879425048828
14008/28840	Has not your excellency heard that the French _chargé daffaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of Velletri   Oh yes I heard	43.41826248168945
14009/28840	Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a	112.39202117919922
14010/28840	But asked Franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French Sardinian or Tuscan governments   Why said Gaetano with a	31.047632217407227
14011/28840	At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle	83.10501098632812

14013/28840	Then they lift and sink again and both go under at	436.4660339355469

14016/28840	Bah said he I have travelled through Sicily and CalabriaI have sailed two months in the Archipelago and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a	49.83633804321289
14017/28840	I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied Gaetano but you questioned me and I have answered thats	38.282981872558594
14018/28840	Yes and your conversation is most interesting and as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for Monte Crist	38.70024108886719

14020/28840	As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crev	66.75408172607422
14021/28840	As for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishingboats with their white sails were alone	69.77517700195312
14022/28840	Hush said the captain it is a	100.15557098388672
14023/28840	But you told me the island was uninhabited   I said there were no fixed habitations on it but I said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for	107.77745819091797
14024/28840	And for pirates   And for pirates returned Gaetano repeating Franzs	69.0190200805664
14025/28840	It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind	64.40536499023438
14026/28840	It seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a	83.83424377441406
14027/28840	Oh that goes for nothing said Gaet	93.58800506591797
14028/28840	If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa but only from the	48.510501861572266
14029/28840	You think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors   That is what we must find out returned Gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial	58.347957611083984
14030/28840	How can you find out   You shall	45.26967239379883
14031/28840	Gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the	63.68449401855469
14032/28840	The pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of	96.0518798828125
14033/28840	Gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to	106.92245483398438
14034/28840	All this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was	120.3628158569336
14035/28840	Gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be	74.89558410644531
14036/28840	As for Franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two doublebarrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited	65.2216567993164
14037/28840	This track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the	46.78581619262695
14038/28840	Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on	69.19624328613281
14039/28840	Well exclaimed Franz and the sailors in	105.22955322265625
14040/28840	They are Spanish smugglers said he they have with them two Corsican	134.20899963378906
14041/28840	And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers   Alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one	71.16643524169922
14042/28840	This costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellowcreature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without	106.7037582397461
14043/28840	Ah said Franz then you are a smuggler occasionally Gaetano   Your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetr	36.41735076904297
14044/28840	Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo   Oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by	59.804710388183594
14045/28840	And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land   Nothing at all smugglers are not	60.26402282714844
14046/28840	But these two Corsican bandits said Franz calculating the chances of	74.26278686523438
14047/28840	It is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the	116.24129486083984
14048/28840	How so   Because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a Corsicans nature to revenge	67.09947967529297
14049/28840	What do you mean by having made a stiffhaving assassinated a man said Franz continuing his	85.67394256591797
14050/28840	I mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the	36.13721466064453
14051/28840	Well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and	49.27199172973633
14052/28840	Do you think they will grant it   Without	70.27204895019531
14053/28840	How many are they   Four and the two bandits make	228.8675994873047
14054/28840	Just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to Monte Crist	56.763885498046875
14055/28840	Yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due	28.806427001953125
14056/28840	By all means be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses I do more than permit I exhort	69.45561218261719
14057/28840	For a man who like Franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave	127.29219055175781
14058/28840	On the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and	88.20863342285156
14059/28840	The history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his	83.10151672363281
14060/28840	The sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the	82.4237289428711
14061/28840	Through the darkness Franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons	94.03121185302734
14062/28840	The blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces	74.47588348388672
14063/28840	Gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the	97.5507583618164
14064/28840	At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landingplace their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the newcomers were and what were their	89.0474624633789
14065/28840	They soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was ro	73.64149475097656
14066/28840	When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried Who comes there in Sard	76.06885528564453
14067/28840	Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned	65.05486297607422
14068/28840	Will your excellency give your name or remain _incognito_ asked the	45.63505172729492
14069/28840	My name must rest unknown replied Franz merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for	406.8681335449219
14070/28840	As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the	55.95410919189453
14071/28840	Not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied Franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each	112.23077392578125
14072/28840	The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said _Saccommodi	33.32422637939453
14073/28840	The Italian _saccommodi_ is untranslatable it means at once Come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the	121.74649810791016
14074/28840	It is like that Turkish phrase of Molières that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utter	145.0405731201172
14075/28840	The sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land Gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came	81.74198913574219
14076/28840	One of his guns was swung over his shoulder Gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquiet	85.71847534179688
14077/28840	Gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their	76.90033721923828
14078/28840	They advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry	88.18075561523438
14079/28840	Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrt	40.83620071411133
14080/28840	Franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the haltingplaces of the wandering visitors of Monte Crist	45.00893020629883
14081/28840	As for his suspicions once on _terra firma_ once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to	131.91134643554688
14082/28840	He mentioned this to Gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them	98.1504135131836
14083/28840	Besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you I will go and offer them two of our birds for a	88.90080261230469
14084/28840	You are a born diplomat returned Franz go and	215.2440948486328
14085/28840	Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a	120.97994232177734
14086/28840	Franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious	90.5142593383789
14087/28840	Well said Franz anything newdo they refuse   On the contrary returned Gaetano the chief who was told you were a young Frenchman invites you to sup with	49.92122268676758
14088/28840	Well observed Franz this chief is very polite and I see no objectionthe more so as I bring my share of the	100.34272003173828
14089/28840	Oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his	95.06348419189453
14090/28840	His house Has he built one here then   No but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they	103.59307098388672

14093/28840	Franz looked at Gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this	83.73436737060547
14094/28840	Ah replied he guessing Franzs thought I know this is a serious	89.31954956054688
14095/28840	What should you do in my place   I who have nothing to loseI should	41.780582427978516

14097/28840	There is something very peculiar about this chief then   Listen said Gaetano lowering his voice I do not know if what they say is truehe stopped to see if anyone was	70.48474884033203
14098/28840	What do they say   That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is	41.49579620361328
14099/28840	It is no nonsense it is quite	98.2887191772461
14100/28840	Cama the pilot of the _Saint Ferdinand_ went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy	114.19226837158203
14101/28840	Do you know observed Franz that with such stories you make me think of Ali Babas enchanted cavern   I tell you what I have been	48.90247344970703
14102/28840	Then you advise me to accept   Oh I dont say that your excellency will do as you please I should be sorry to advise you in the	21.607547760009766
14103/28840	Franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper	93.53224182128906
14104/28840	Franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his	255.8846893310547
14105/28840	He turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was	82.34578704833984
14106/28840	Never mind that returned the sailor I know their	236.95556640625
14107/28840	Is it a very beautiful vessel   I would not wish for a better to sail round the	97.53205871582031
14108/28840	Of what burden is she   About a hundred tons but she is built to stand any	148.17359924316406
14109/28840	She is what the English call a	457.61407470703125
14110/28840	Where was she built   I know not but my own opinion is she is a Geno	40.59477233886719
14111/28840	And how did a leader of smugglers continued Franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa   I did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the	64.72906494140625
14112/28840	Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to	83.8394775390625
14113/28840	And if this person be not a smuggler who is he   A wealthy signor who travels for his	100.24855041503906
14114/28840	Come thought Franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not	209.75880432128906

14125/28840	Without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indisc	67.46532440185547
14126/28840	Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the band	61.831241607666016

14130/28840	There was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent French although with a foreign accent said   Welcome	102.64281463623047
14131/28840	I beg you will remove your band	77.12154388427734
14132/28840	His pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of	60.51838684082031
14133/28840	He was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the South had small hands and	216.47772216796875
14134/28840	But what astonished Franz who had treated Gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found	59.92551803588867
14135/28840	The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of	175.96812438964844
14136/28840	The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off	233.5330047607422
14137/28840	Let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable	85.19428253173828

14141/28840	Ali is the supper ready   At this moment the tapestry moved aside and a Nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining	43.021549224853516
14142/28840	Now said the unknown to Franz I do not know if you are of my opinion but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one	52.7133903503418

14148/28840	Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around	141.9296875
14149/28840	The diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their	63.10886001586914

14155/28840	Ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host there	106.39018249511719
14156/28840	Yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and graceyes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove	72.26495361328125
14157/28840	He remembers that I saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his	104.01405334472656
14158/28840	Ali approached his master took his hand and kissed	44.9505615234375
14159/28840	Would it be impertinent Signor Sinbad said Franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness   20081m       Oh they are simple enough replied the	22.211246490478516

14163/28840	Franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the halfkindness halfcruelty with which his host related the brief	146.5074462890625

14185/28840	Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver	163.42637634277344
14186/28840	The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused Franzs	196.52101135253906

14209/28840	They both arose and while he who called himself Sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant Franz entered still another	242.0930633544922

14232/28840	He found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure	53.461647033691406
14233/28840	The air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the	90.21884155273438
14234/28840	There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as	63.82391357421875

14236/28840	It seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his	106.82756805419922

14259/28840	He looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish	102.89042663574219
14260/28840	Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly	54.03260040283203
14261/28840	He took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two	41.724308013916016
14262/28840	These animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and Franz could not consider them as	189.69329833984375
14263/28840	Moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his	239.2523956298828
14264/28840	Since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the _Thousand and One Nights_ and he was irresistibly attracted towards the gro	25.798433303833008
14265/28840	Then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two	63.23384094238281
14266/28840	The second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast	112.57079315185547
14267/28840	Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a seagull on the wave continuing her flight towards Cors	68.16293334960938
14268/28840	Why he remarked to Gaetano you told me that Signor Sinbad was going to Malaga while it seems he is in the direction of PortoVec	27.66335678100586
14269/28840	Dont you remember said the patron I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands   True and he is going to land them added	47.038604736328125
14270/28840	Ah he is one who fears neither God nor Satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a	118.6420669555664
14271/28840	20093m       But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said	48.74034118652344
14272/28840	And what cares he for that replied Gaetano with a laugh or any authorities He smiles at	164.4662628173828
14273/28840	As to Franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Crist	31.33095359802246
14274/28840	He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under	67.4410400390625
14275/28840	At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of PortoVec	46.21951675415039
14276/28840	With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper Sinbad hashish statuesall became a dream for	100.68257904052734
14277/28840	The boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of Monte Crist	54.732757568359375
14278/28840	When Franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at	71.62972259521484
14279/28840	He set out and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mailco	74.1701431274414
14280/28840	An apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrinis	64.81548309326172
14281/28840	At last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the	70.07951354980469
14282/28840	On his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackneycoachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the Hôtel de Lond	43.24654006958008
14283/28840	Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini and asked for Albert de Morcer	26.509302139282227
14284/28840	The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a par	79.29719543457031
14285/28840	The two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable	85.01808166503906
14286/28840	The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller	74.8110580444336
14287/28840	Very good signor Pastrini said Franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following	102.44058227539062
14288/28840	As to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage   What as to the carriage exclaimed	101.80514526367188
14289/28840	Come come Signor Pastrini no joking we must have a	52.48823165893555
14290/28840	Sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all I can	45.43425369262695
14291/28840	And when shall we know inquired	292.1114501953125
14292/28840	Oh the deuce then we shall pay the more thats all I see plainly	98.32972717285156
14293/28840	At Drakes or Aarons one pays twentyfive lire for common days and thirty or thirtyfive lire a day more for Sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and theres an end of	178.00552368164062
14294/28840	I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a	102.52091979980469
14295/28840	Then they must put horses to	626.114501953125
14296/28840	It is a little worse for the journey but thats no	138.51832580566406
14297/28840	Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not	63.33330154418945
14298/28840	Do you understand that my dear Franzno horses he said but cant we have posthorses   They have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for	106.35230255126953
14299/28840	What are we to say to this asked	54.593177795410156
14300/28840	I say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension I am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to	99.5948486328125
14301/28840	Is supper ready Signor Pastrini   Yes your excell	15.451170921325684
14302/28840	But the carriage and horses said	175.79141235351562
14303/28840	Be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for	72.5252685546875
14304/28840	Morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or welllined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six	167.74574279785156
14305/28840	Roman Bandits   The next morning Franz woke first and instantly rang the	74.13121795654297
14306/28840	The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself	47.5678825378418
14307/28840	What is the matter said Albert entering no carriage to be had   Just so returned Franz you have guessed	89.16971588134766
14308/28840	Well your Eternal City is a nice sort of	95.07550048828125
14309/28840	Ah that is something said Albert today is Thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday   Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied Franz which will make it still more	92.45772552490234
14310/28840	My friend said Morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the	66.01461029052734
14311/28840	At least we can have a window   Where   In the Cor	49.53700637817383
14312/28840	Ah a window exclaimed Signor Pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a	47.85879135131836
14313/28840	The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupef	11.136754989624023
14314/28840	Well said Franz to Albert do you know what is the best thing we can do It is to pass the Carnival at Venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have car	64.30354309082031
14315/28840	Ah the devil no cried Albert I came to Rome to see the Carnival and I will though I see it on st	103.10456085205078
14316/28840	We will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes and we shall have complete	132.57200622558594
14317/28840	But excellencysaid Pastrini still striving to gain his	67.12095642089844
14318/28840	Do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned Signor Pastrini with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat I will do all I can and I hope you will be	48.35786056518555
14319/28840	When do you wish the carriage to be here   In an	28.737720489501953
14320/28840	In an hour it will be at the	29.282787322998047
14321/28840	Excellency cried the _cicerone_ seeing Franz approach the window shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace   Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to	52.03741455078125
14322/28840	Franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the Hôtel de Londres was the	32.74343490600586
14323/28840	The genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that	293.1076965332031
14324/28840	Franz and Albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the _cicerone_ sprang into the seat	64.07141876220703
14325/28840	Where do your excellencies wish to go asked	28.180295944213867
14326/28840	To Saint Peters first and then to the Colosseum returned	26.99370765686035
14327/28840	But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peters and a month to study	60.12226104736328
14328/28840	The day was passed at Saint Peters	362.35101318359375
14329/28840	Suddenly the daylight began to fade away Franz took out his watchit was halfpast	79.29357147216797
14330/28840	They returned to the hotel at the door Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at	41.47734832763672
14331/28840	He wished to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him Saint Peters by	54.945953369140625
14332/28840	When we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have	180.58297729492188
14333/28840	Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable rep	59.29219055175781
14334/28840	At the end of the dinner he entered in	77.16082763671875
14335/28840	Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was	77.51707458496094
14336/28840	Excellency said Pastrini I am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that I	25.12247085571289
14337/28840	Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked Albert lighting his	45.61572265625
14338/28840	No and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at Rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of	49.56789779663086
14339/28840	It is much more convenient at Pariswhen anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done	216.71507263183594
14340/28840	That is what all the French say returned Signor Pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason I do not understand why they	39.722904205322266
14341/28840	But said Albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do	147.2649383544922
14342/28840	Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder their walk on the Boulevard de Gand and the Café de	37.10111618041992
14343/28840	It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its wait	110.88834381103516
14344/28840	Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very	51.54769515991211
14345/28840	You mean the Colosseum   It is the same	13.211332321166992
14346/28840	You have told your coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo to drive round the walls and reenter by the Porta San Giovanni   These are my words	29.784671783447266
14347/28840	Impossible   Very dangerous to say the	181.7576141357422
14348/28840	Dangerousand why   On account of the famous Luigi V	163.88375854492188
14349/28840	Pray who may this famous Luigi Vampa be inquired Albert he may be very famous at Rome but I can assure you he is quite unknown at	100.20301055908203
14350/28840	What do you not know him   I have not that	16.663326263427734
14351/28840	You have never heard his name  	42.791412353515625
14352/28840	Well then he is a bandit compared to whom the Decesaris and the Gasparones were mere	75.9184341430664
14353/28840	Now then Albert cried Franz here is a bandit for you at	80.57160949707031
14354/28840	I forewarn you Signor Pastrini that I shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this	31.809370040893555
14355/28840	Once upon a time Well go	222.7489776611328
14356/28840	Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many Frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend	52.46843719482422
14357/28840	But if your excellency doubt my veracity   Signor Pastrini returned Franz you are more susceptible than Cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your	46.097232818603516
14358/28840	Come sit down and tell us all about this Signor V	58.93867492675781
14359/28840	I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of Mastr	43.056488037109375
14360/28840	Because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the	161.5077667236328
14361/28840	On your honor is that true cried	163.09800720214844
14362/28840	Count returned Signor Pastrini hurt at Alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions I do not say this to you but to your companion who knows Rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed	45.43623733520508
14363/28840	My dear fellow said Albert turning to Franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and doublebarrelled	35.96778869628906
14364/28840	Whilst Albert proposed this scheme Signor Pastrinis face assumed an expression impossible to	199.51071166992188
14365/28840	And pray asked Franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage   Not out of my armory for at Terracina I was plundered even of my hunting	67.03784942626953
14366/28840	And you   I shared the same fate at Aquapend	54.86751174926758
14367/28840	Do you know Signor Pastrini said Albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their	39.20981979370117
14368/28840	Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to Franz as the only one likely to listen with	105.27251434326172
14369/28840	Your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by	65.5650634765625
14370/28840	What cried Albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance   No for it would be	37.144981384277344
14371/28840	What could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you   Eh _parbleu_they should kill	101.84822082519531
14372/28840	The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say Your friend is decidedly	85.54093933105469
14373/28840	Albert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_ which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible	56.07534408569336
14374/28840	Well Signor Pastrini said Franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this Luigi V	43.63117980957031
14375/28840	Is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short Describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like Jean Sbogar or Lara we may recognize	83.16018676757812
14376/28840	Let us see the watch said	284.69073486328125
14377/28840	Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet bearing the name of its maker of Parisian manufacture and a counts coron	105.93412780761719
14378/28840	_Peste_ returned Albert I compliment you on it I have its fellowhe took his watch from his waistcoat pocketand it cost me 3000 franc	128.89495849609375
14379/28840	Let us hear the history said Franz motioning Signor Pastrini to seat	56.821109771728516
14380/28840	Your excellencies permit it asked the	60.9757080078125
14381/28840	_Pardieu_ cried Albert you are not a preacher to remain standing   The host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning Luigi V	50.62818145751953
14382/28840	What do you think of that Albertat twoandtwenty to be thus famous   Yes and at his age Alexander Cæsar and Napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind	50.694034576416016
14383/28840	So continued Franz the hero of this history is only twoandtwenty   Scarcely so	31.135488510131836
14384/28840	Is he tall or short   Of the middle heightabout the same stature as his excellency returned the host pointing to	74.69734954833984
14385/28840	Thanks for the comparison said Albert with a	119.45377349853516

14391/28840	The same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of styl	86.97083282470703
14392/28840	The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and	142.49659729003906
14393/28840	At the end of three months he had learned to	69.69325256347656
14394/28840	The curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a pen	84.83362579345703
14395/28840	This demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the styl	155.09861755371094

14397/28840	With this Luigi purchased books and pencil	512.3548583984375
14398/28840	He applied his imitative powers to everything and like Giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and	146.89120483398438
14399/28840	Then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that Pinelli the famous sculptor had	93.61746978759766

14401/28840	The next day they kept their word and thus they grew up	133.0393524169922
14402/28840	And yet their natural disposition revealed	630.0606079101562

14464/28840	You have determined then to abandon her to the common law said Carlin	98.56181335449219

14474/28840	The names of all including Carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of Diavolacc	46.97342300415039
14475/28840	He was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief and to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his	49.05083084106445

14485/28840	As they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolacc	42.64436340332031
14486/28840	This apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of Carlini who remained seated and ate and drank	66.18263244628906
14487/28840	Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid Rita at the captains	71.52040100097656
14488/28840	Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the band	33.56889343261719
14489/28840	A knife was plunged up to the hilt in Ritas left	69.42021179199219

14492/28840	All savage natures appreciate a desperate	364.7584228515625
14493/28840	No other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what Carlini had	84.80628204345703

14495/28840	Carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of fire	72.04753112792969
14496/28840	Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the	33.487464904785156
14497/28840	At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the	70.76959228515625
14498/28840	It was Ritas father who brought his daughters ransom in	159.6657257080078
14499/28840	Here said he to Cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my	30.33987045288086
14500/28840	But the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to	60.354557037353516
14501/28840	They both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moon	138.20065307617188
14502/28840	Cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a	27.43268394470215
14503/28840	There said he demand thy child of Carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his	53.339603424072266
14504/28840	The old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his	87.62545776367188
14505/28840	At length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not	60.23945999145508
14506/28840	As he approached Carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans	32.33132553100586
14507/28840	A woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the womans face became	40.89787673950195
14508/28840	The old man recognized his child and Carlini recognized the old	56.03335189819336
14509/28840	I expected thee said the bandit to Ritas	57.40929412841797
14510/28840	Wretch returned the old man what hast thou done and he gazed with terror on Rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bos	101.52538299560547
14511/28840	A ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the	41.604793548583984
14512/28840	Cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit I loved her therefore I slew her for she would have served as the sport of the whole	75.80123138427734
14513/28840	The old man spoke not and grew pale as	271.4342041015625
14514/28840	Now continued Carlini if I have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in Ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his	44.66812515258789
14515/28840	Thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my	93.51957702636719
14516/28840	20115m       Carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss	26.236387252807617
14517/28840	These were the first tears the man of blood had ever we	178.24472045898438
14518/28840	Now said the old man aid me to bury my	109.99671173095703
14519/28840	Carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to rep	43.38576126098633
14520/28840	When the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the	139.12646484375
14521/28840	Then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the	45.849361419677734
14522/28840	Then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was	112.06976318359375
14523/28840	Then extending his hand the old man said I thank you my son and now leave me	57.553794860839844
14524/28840	Carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the	47.52699661254883
14525/28840	It had been resolved the night before to change their encamp	113.56373596191406
14526/28840	An hour before daybreak Cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to	57.67739486694336
14527/28840	But Carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of Ritas	35.793922424316406
14528/28840	He went toward the place where he had left	28.06715965270996
14529/28840	He found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters	55.8050537109375
14530/28840	He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the	62.16989517211914
14531/28840	But he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the Roman carbineers Carlini was	49.54019546508789
14532/28840	There was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his	86.37669372558594
14533/28840	That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlinis rear when he	49.399192810058594
14534/28840	On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated	62.012325286865234
14535/28840	They told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the	180.12228393554688
14536/28840	Thus from Fondi to Perusia everyone trembles at the name of Cucumet	59.7383918762207
14537/28840	These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between Luigi and	376.7013854980469
14538/28840	Time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of	71.43359375
14539/28840	They were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and	163.30914306640625
14540/28840	One day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards	48.567222595214844
14541/28840	Instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the	76.00706481933594
14542/28840	The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question	105.25459289550781
14543/28840	That is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the	41.67549133300781
14544/28840	Cucumetto cried Luigi and Teresa at the same	45.08455276489258
14545/28840	Yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch	36.18738555908203
14546/28840	Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be	70.41131591796875
14547/28840	Yes it is very annoying said Vampa but we have not seen	23.359790802001953
14548/28840	Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they	106.34144592285156
14549/28840	Vampa then removed the stone and Cucumetto came	42.22141647338867
14550/28840	Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their par	46.84540939331055

14552/28840	But Vampa raised his head proudly as to Teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of	72.2918701171875
14553/28840	Several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumet	82.83415985107422
14554/28840	The time of the Carnival was at	105.43879699707031
14555/28840	The Count of SanFelice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in Rome were	98.55048370361328

14557/28840	Luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the	126.82706451416016

14561/28840	Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday	129.3957977294922
14562/28840	They both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and	116.89557647705078
14563/28840	The _festa_ was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the gardenwal	45.55106735229492

14567/28840	Four young men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the	74.5200424194336
14568/28840	They were attired as peasants of Albano Velletri CivitaCastellana and	62.353546142578125
14569/28840	We need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and	67.35721588134766
14570/28840	Carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady	216.95484924316406
14571/28840	Carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her	138.5227508544922
14572/28840	The Count of SanFelice pointed out Teresa who was hanging on Luigis arm in a group of	95.86679077148438
14573/28840	Will you allow me father said Carm	346.1198425292969
14574/28840	Certainly replied the count are we not in Carnival time   Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to	43.85974884033203
14575/28840	The young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to Teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts	72.64083862304688
14576/28840	Teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at Luigi who could not refuse his ass	135.37692260742188
14577/28840	Luigi slowly relinquished Teresas arm which he had held beneath his own and Teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadr	113.87596893310547
14578/28840	Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his	325.0491943359375
14579/28840	It was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole	85.91313171386719
14580/28840	He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his	114.0440444946289
14581/28840	Luigi was jealous   He felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition Teresa might escape	115.5069351196289
14582/28840	The young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered	244.48550415039062
14583/28840	We have said that Teresa was handsome but this is not all Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegan	65.27741241455078
14584/28840	She had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the Count of SanFelices daughter we will not undertake to say that Carmela was not jealous of	38.39615249633789
14585/28840	And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where Luigi awaited	86.6237564086914
14586/28840	Thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers	123.55968475341797
14587/28840	The quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition Carmela alone objecting to it but the Count of SanFelice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acc	55.77374267578125
14588/28840	One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had	47.14743423461914
14589/28840	The truth was that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed Teresa toward another part of the	150.30250549316406
14590/28840	Teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within	69.06471252441406
14591/28840	She herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching	105.81529235839844
14592/28840	Why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were mer	67.55419921875
14593/28840	However to Teresas great astonishment Luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the	145.2626953125
14594/28840	And what said your cavalier to you   He said it only depended on myself to have it and I had only one word to	57.89529800415039
14595/28840	Do you desire it as ardently as you say  	28.916139602661133
14596/28840	Well then you shall have it   The young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her	41.88622283935547
14597/28840	As Luigi spoke thus he left	206.64566040039062
14598/28840	Teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a	66.95744323730469
14599/28840	20121m       That night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the	52.00094985961914
14600/28840	The Villa of SanFelice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely Carm	70.86634063720703
14601/28840	Awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressinggown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the	62.07850646972656
14602/28840	When she recovered her father was by her	202.95803833007812
14603/28840	All the servants surrounded her offering her	665.4620361328125
14604/28840	An entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured   Her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen	81.2369613647461
14605/28840	Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized	190.78965759277344

14607/28840	He came toward Teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous	69.45597839355469
14608/28840	The young girl was very pensive but seeing Luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a	144.43792724609375
14609/28840	Luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the gro	62.19936752319336
14610/28840	The young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfast	45.28691101074219
14611/28840	Teresa said Luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts	123.3580551147461
14612/28840	Yes replied Teresa with astonishment but I was mad to utter such a	61.163970947265625
14613/28840	And I replied Very well you shall have	90.4315185546875
14614/28840	Yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi but of course your reply was only to please	101.09982299804688
14615/28840	I have promised no more than I have given you Teresa said Luigi	71.08307647705078
14616/28840	Go into the grotto and dress	133.59814453125
14617/28840	Teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking Luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing	87.30644226074219
14618/28840	When he saw Luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward	43.802345275878906
14619/28840	Luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up	79.65589904785156
14620/28840	In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross	79.36253356933594
14621/28840	On arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to	57.260433197021484
14622/28840	That is your road excellency and now you cannot again	157.74147033691406
14623/28840	And here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of	88.30989074707031
14624/28840	Thank you said Luigi drawing back his hand I render a service I do not sell	108.80171203613281
14625/28840	Well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a	57.2006950378418
14626/28840	Then said the traveller take these two Venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of ear	55.457679748535156
14627/28840	And then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between Albano and CivitaCastell	38.146968841552734
14628/28840	I accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequ	60.93498611450195
14629/28840	For a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piast	161.5271759033203
14630/28840	What is your name inquired the	66.64241790771484
14631/28840	Luigi Vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied Alexander King of Maced	129.49159240722656
14632/28840	And yours   I said the traveller am called Sinbad the	34.02736282348633
14633/28840	Yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to Vampa as his	74.1194839477539
14634/28840	Well and what may you have to say against this name inquired Albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth I must	52.24861526489258
14635/28840	The name of Sinbad the Sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous	41.890140533447266
14636/28840	Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had	55.93946075439453
14637/28840	As he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a	23.74855613708496
14638/28840	He listened to know whence this sound could	211.05545043945312
14639/28840	A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced	158.24563598632812
14640/28840	He bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the	40.50306701660156
14641/28840	Three cries for help came more distinctly to his	272.5111083984375
14642/28840	He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa as Nessus the centaur carried Deian	156.8824462890625
14643/28840	This man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the	42.596256256103516
14644/28840	Vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking	52.65190887451172
14645/28840	The young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then	47.844783782958984
14646/28840	The ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with Teresa in his	102.0274887084961
14647/28840	The young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of	91.0029525756836
14648/28840	Vampa then rushed towards Teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrot	63.50857925415039
14649/28840	Fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome	180.2804718017578
14650/28840	When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded	43.15555953979492
14651/28840	He had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of	94.9106674194336
14652/28840	Vampa approached the corpse and recognized Cucumet	41.351585388183594
14653/28840	From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of Teresa and had sworn she should be	53.07190704345703
14654/28840	Vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary Teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her	80.18767547607422
14655/28840	Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress   Ah said hegood good You are dressed it is now my turn to dress	88.23619079589844
14656/28840	20125m       Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of SanFelices	21.950956344604492
14657/28840	Vampa took Cucumettos body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn Teresa remained	57.53568649291992

14659/28840	He would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of Florian and would have declared on reaching Paris that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine	56.58940887451172
14660/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of	29.902257919311523
14661/28840	Vampa in this attire resembled a painting by Léopold Robert or Schn	74.51548767089844
14662/28840	He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumet	23.362091064453125
14663/28840	The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his	50.685489654541016
14664/28840	Now he said to Teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be   Oh yes exclaimed the young girl	45.10149383544922
14665/28840	And follow me wherever I go   To the worlds	101.10643005371094
14666/28840	Then take my arm and let us on we have no time to	44.42501449584961
14667/28840	The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a	88.85316467285156
14668/28840	They went towards the forest and soon entered	167.6934356689453

14672/28840	Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her	118.5821762084961
14673/28840	Suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at V	57.6077766418457

14680/28840	At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to	51.308109283447266

14700/28840	Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him   Why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the Tiber and the smugglers of the	49.32969284057617
14701/28840	And how does he behave towards travellers   Alas his plan is very	98.7541275024414
14702/28840	It depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours	121.86189270019531
14703/28840	At the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistolshot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the	115.16749572753906
14704/28840	Well Albert inquired Franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall   Quite so said Albert if the way be pictures	43.28083801269531
14705/28840	The clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman	32.85100173950195
14706/28840	Excellencies said he the coach is	233.08578491210938
14707/28840	Well then said Franz let us to the Colosse	24.88524627685547
14708/28840	By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets your excellencies   By the streets _morbleu_ by the streets cried	32.814735412597656
14709/28840	Ah my dear fellow said Albert rising and lighting his third cigar really I thought you had more	106.05998992919922
14710/28840	So saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the	30.710567474365234
14711/28840	The Colosseum   Franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to	67.99247741699219
14712/28840	This itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed	73.28016662597656
14713/28840	Seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of	94.01812744140625
14714/28840	The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a _cicerone_ who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his	42.39500427246094
14715/28840	As for Albert and Franz they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their	42.56513214111328
14716/28840	Thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conduct	129.3728485107422
14717/28840	All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself	93.73726654052734
14718/28840	Conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery	87.11415100097656
14719/28840	The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like Franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the	173.5670166015625
14720/28840	And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some	173.00357055664062
14721/28840	By a sort of instinctive impulse Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his	162.84654235839844
14722/28840	About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with	65.68162536621094
14723/28840	The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made	109.95140075683594
14724/28840	He wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed	105.45317840576172
14725/28840	The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black	171.67132568359375
14726/28840	20135m       From the imperfect means Franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of	84.42886352539062
14727/28840	The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere	89.5706787109375
14728/28840	I beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the Roman dialect but I dont think Im many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Later	40.34893798828125
14729/28840	Say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest Tuscan tis I who am too	80.45988464355469
14730/28840	But even if you had caused me to wait a little while I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of	41.130821228027344
14731/28840	Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man I came here direct from the Castle of	66.71822357177734
14732/28840	Angelo and I had an immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Be	101.86254119873047
14733/28840	And who is Beppo   Oh Beppo is employed in the prison and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss	58.31013107299805
14734/28840	Indeed You are a provident person I	64.25386047363281
14735/28840	Why you see no one knows what may	34.58110809326172
14736/28840	Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of	50.43902587890625
14737/28840	Briefly what did you learn   That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at Rome at the commencement of all great	66.11550903320312
14738/28840	One of the culprits will be _mazzolato_3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest	46.02739715576172
14739/28840	The other sufferer is sentenced to be _decapitato_4 and he your excellency is poor Pepp	25.52834701538086
14740/28840	The fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an	137.91232299804688
14741/28840	But Peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with	111.64849090576172
14742/28840	Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and	245.81484985351562
14743/28840	Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise them	328.3138732910156
14744/28840	My good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant	102.2003402709961
14745/28840	Perhaps I am but one thing I have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served	75.53109741210938
14746/28840	I should hate and despise myself as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extrem	112.82637023925781
14747/28840	That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than	48.57038116455078
14748/28840	And what is your excellencys project   Just	24.670991897583008
14749/28840	I will so advantageously bestow 2000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino and during that year another skilfully placed 1000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his	80.33299255371094
14750/28840	And do you feel sure of succeeding   _Pardieu_ exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in	37.01146697998047
14751/28840	What did your excellency say inquired the	31.454875946044922
14752/28840	I said my good fellow that I would do more singlehanded by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses	71.73490142822266
14753/28840	Leave me then to act and have no fears for the	103.58068084716797
14754/28840	At least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should	87.8436279296875
14755/28840	Take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I	94.85555267333984
14756/28840	Remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work	53.248817443847656
14757/28840	And what of that Is not a day divided into twentyfour hours each hour into sixty minutes and every minute subdivided into sixty seconds Now in 86400 seconds very many things can be	122.86564636230469
14758/28840	And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or	45.34072494506836
14759/28840	I have engaged the three lower windows at the Café Rospoli should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on	62.02063751220703
14760/28840	And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution   Send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and I will give it to	46.1727294921875
14761/28840	Your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not   Nay I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the	32.23417663574219
14762/28840	Well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to	132.7123565673828
14763/28840	Have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for I may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when I in my turn may require your aid and	162.24778747558594
14764/28840	Tis some travellers who are visiting the Colosseum by torch	47.178436279296875
14765/28840	Well then if you obtain the reprieve   The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red	38.42144775390625
14766/28840	And if you fail   Then all three windows will have yellow draper	98.72945404052734
14767/28840	And then   And then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your	56.786441802978516
14768/28840	Adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as I do upon	50.40834426879883
14769/28840	Saying these words the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to Franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of	72.15727996826172
14770/28840	The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert who made the lofty building reecho with the sound of his friends	182.8958282470703
14771/28840	Franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his	88.22777557373047
14772/28840	Franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had	72.31890106201172
14773/28840	And the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer Sinbad the	93.83816528320312
14774/28840	As we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another	150.6909637451172
14775/28840	In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of	111.25447082519531
14776/28840	Worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till	126.74285125732422
14777/28840	Like a genuine Frenchman Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro Argentina and Franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the	68.49899291992188
14778/28840	Yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more seriousminded companion would have taken weeks to	111.75496673583984
14779/28840	Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the Teatro Argentina and also what performers appeared in	65.87455749511719
14780/28840	The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for representation and the principal actors were Coselli Moriani and La Specch	58.211509704589844
14781/28840	The young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_ supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of	54.2541389465332
14782/28840	Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general	69.6508560180664
14783/28840	It was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling	102.70308685302734
14784/28840	The Carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to	122.9054946899414
14785/28840	With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate	46.38698959350586
14786/28840	The truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival with the Holy Week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the	91.20104217529297
14787/28840	Towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris where indeed he had imagined she still	103.05977630615234
14788/28840	And her name is   Countess	75.24993896484375
14789/28840	Ah I know her by name exclaimed Albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as	105.40300750732422
14790/28840	I was to have been presented to her when I met her at Madame Villeforts	55.36050796508789
14791/28840	Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence asked	172.19593811035156
14792/28840	At that instant the countess perceived Franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the	61.99307632446289
14793/28840	Upon my word said Albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful count	37.676639556884766
14794/28840	Is there indeed my good fellow Pray tell me is it sympathy of heart   No of taste continued Franz grave	80.22037506103516
14795/28840	And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced   By the countesss visiting the Colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly	49.580345153808594
14796/28840	You were with her then   I	51.122676849365234
14797/28840	20143m       And you will probably find your theme illch	26.64865493774414
14798/28840	But said Albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the	154.01239013671875
14799/28840	Are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks   Certainly directly the curtain falls on the	44.74923324584961
14800/28840	What a confounded long time this first act	214.4410400390625
14801/28840	I believe on my soul that they never mean to finish	78.93627166748047
14802/28840	Oh yes they will only listen to that charming	107.8659896850586
14803/28840	But what an awkward inelegant fellow he	355.9312744140625
14804/28840	At least you must admire Morianis style and	2086.96484375
14805/28840	I never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a wom	108.62468719482422
14806/28840	My good friend said Franz turning to him while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to	106.89385986328125
14807/28840	This important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss	90.76611328125
14808/28840	At the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the Italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other	59.744686126708984
14809/28840	Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew	101.83433532714844
14810/28840	Franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up Alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the	75.38166809082031
14811/28840	Sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a Greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national	117.31208038330078
14812/28840	Behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to	76.30658721923828
14813/28840	Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either	145.45440673828125
14814/28840	All I can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season for I saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a	73.95344543457031
14815/28840	Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black	84.70294189453125
14816/28840	And what do you think of her personal appearance   Oh I consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what Medora must have	65.70637512207031
14817/28840	Franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with Albert while Franz returned to his previous survey of the house and	66.78477478027344
14818/28840	Of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial	192.8545379638672
14819/28840	The ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted	210.60064697265625
14820/28840	The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though Franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single	82.43956756591797
14821/28840	The curtain rose and the attention of Franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the	65.56887817382812
14822/28840	Most of my readers are aware that the second act of _Parisina_ opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina while sleeping betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for U	106.89207458496094
14823/28840	The injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his	122.21885681152344
14824/28840	This duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Doniz	64.9287338256836
14825/28840	Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor Franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his	136.38816833496094
14826/28840	All doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at	157.56752014160156
14827/28840	Perhaps you never before noticed him   What a questionso truly French Do you not know that we Italians have eyes only for the man we love   True replied	104.86709594726562
14828/28840	How ghastly pale he is   Oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said	68.03568267822266
14829/28840	Then you know him almost screamed the count	85.96649169921875
14830/28840	Oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all aboutis he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what   I fancy I have seen him before and I even think he recognizes	93.3290023803711
14831/28840	And I can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget	49.41954803466797
14832/28840	The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and mis	134.66261291503906
14833/28840	This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before	65.27632141113281
14834/28840	I must positively find out who and what he is said Franz rising from his	88.41417694091797
14835/28840	No no cried the countess you must not leave	24.55425262451172
14836/28840	I depend upon you to escort me	102.61707305908203
14837/28840	Oh indeed I cannot permit you to	68.31342315673828
14838/28840	Is it possible whispered Franz that you entertain any fear   Ill tell you answered the count	76.86957550048828
14839/28840	Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen	61.292842864990234
14840/28840	The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before	94.8633804321289
14841/28840	Oh he is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect The coalblack hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burningthe same ghastly pal	95.64114379882812
14842/28840	Then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her	283.7754821777344
14843/28840	Nobody knows who she is or where she comes	334.4258117675781
14844/28840	No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical	200.34506225585938
14845/28840	I entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor	128.20603942871094
14846/28840	For that purpose I mean to keep you all to	94.43354797363281
14847/28840	Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many	176.4096221923828
14848/28840	Listen to me said the countess and do not be so very head	48.38547897338867
14849/28840	I have a party at my house tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the	67.70993041992188
14850/28840	Now I cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for	148.48040771484375
14851/28840	There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his	67.06413269042969
14852/28840	Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the	153.63516235351562
14853/28840	Upon arriving at her hotel Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the	82.0304183959961
14854/28840	Excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfreproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and I longed to be alone that I might compose my startled	81.9360580444336
14855/28840	Nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and I am sure it does not spring from your	54.90868377685547
14856/28840	What is it   Promise me I	35.32758712768555
14857/28840	I will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man	122.6168441772461
14858/28840	I have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is	52.95614242553711
14859/28840	Where he comes from I am ignorant but I can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least	70.12982177734375
14860/28840	Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said	74.97811889648438
14861/28840	Well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man	59.973575592041016
14862/28840	There are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet	426.923095703125
14863/28840	For heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and	101.52848815917969
14864/28840	Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of	97.22183227539062
14865/28840	And now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this	102.4681396484375
14866/28840	For my own part I am quite sure I shall not be able to close my	29.0817813873291
14867/28840	So saying the countess quitted Franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were	146.86326599121094
14868/28840	Upon his return to the hotel Franz found Albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a	55.476539611816406
14869/28840	My dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you Why I did not expect to see you before	83.86275482177734
14870/28840	My dear Albert replied Franz I am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning Italian	101.49813079833984
14871/28840	I should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this	54.333763122558594
14872/28840	Upon my soul these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them ar	189.2117156982422
14873/28840	Why herethey give you their handthey press yours in returnthey keep up a whispering conversationpermit you to accompany them	330.16436767578125
14874/28840	Why if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone	128.53590393066406
14875/28840	And the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the _si_ as Dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to	111.05894470214844
14876/28840	Besides you must have perceived that the countess was really	73.15843200683594
14877/28840	I can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced finelooking fellowadmirably	36.516510009765625
14878/28840	Indeed I feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a firstrate Paris tailorprobably Blin or Hum	78.83655548095703
14879/28840	He was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished	113.80479431152344
14880/28840	Franz smiled for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own	173.07147216796875
14881/28840	Well that tends to confirm my own ideas said Franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and	113.6203842163086
14882/28840	Did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words   I did but they were uttered in the Romaic	62.71049499511719
14883/28840	I knew that from the mixture of Greek	119.60697174072266
14884/28840	I dont know whether I ever told you that when I was at college I was ratherrather strong in	50.64432144165039
14885/28840	He spoke the Romaic language did he   I think	62.30522155761719
14886/28840	What do you say   Nothing	28.23160171508789
14887/28840	But tell me what were you thinking about when I came in   Oh I was arranging a little surprise for	49.24164581298828
14888/28840	Of what nature   Why you know it is quite impossible to procure a	49.95006561279297
14889/28840	Certainly and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get	56.60158157348633
14890/28840	Now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my	233.9747314453125
14891/28840	Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his	40.9957275390625
14892/28840	Franz cried Albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just	59.01900100708008
14893/28840	And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you	106.04496765136719
14894/28840	You agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question   I	47.48460006713867
14895/28840	Neither can we procure horses   True we have offered any sum but have	235.3304901123047
14896/28840	Well now what do you say to a cart I dare say such a thing might be	59.812156677246094
14897/28840	And a pair of oxen   As easily found as the	113.82797241210938
14898/28840	Then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be	94.16873931884766
14899/28840	The cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by Léopold	80.06503295898438
14900/28840	It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrent	59.40586853027344
14901/28840	Our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a	102.45494842529297
14902/28840	Albert I am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital	85.59503936767578
14903/28840	And quite a national one too replied Albert with gratified	219.54124450683594
14904/28840	A mere masque borrowed from our own	99.03550720214844
14905/28840	Ha ha ye Romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly	156.50990295410156
14906/28840	But you dont know us when we cant have one thing we invent	133.77301025390625
14907/28840	And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody   Only to our	282.8734130859375
14908/28840	Upon my return home I sent for him and I then explained to him what I wished to	46.6185302734375
14909/28840	He assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all I	106.36700439453125
14910/28840	One thing I was sorry for when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superflu	69.914794921875
14911/28840	And where is he now   Who   Our	50.818336486816406
14912/28840	Gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too	129.50770568847656
14913/28840	Then he will be able to give us an answer	84.10411071777344
14914/28840	At this instant the door opened and the head of Signor Pastrini	18.58013916015625
14915/28840	Now then asked Albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen   Better than that replied Signor Pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with	63.15452575683594
14916/28840	Take care my worthy host said Albert _better_ is a sure enemy to _well	238.82518005371094
14917/28840	Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self	23.211605072021484
14918/28840	But what _have_ you done asked	204.3271026611328
14919/28840	When then the Count of Monte Cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the Palazzo Rosp	39.37410354614258
14920/28840	The friends looked at each other with unutterable	38.53514862060547
14921/28840	But do you think asked Albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger   What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo asked Franz of his	49.64802932739258
14922/28840	A very great nobleman but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot exactly say but this I know that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold	117.86988067626953
14923/28840	He would have writtenor   At this instant someone knocked at the	57.51190185546875
14924/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive	56.689178466796875
14925/28840	Faith Franz whispered Albert there is not much to find fault with	196.99790954589844
14926/28840	Tell the count replied Franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on	85.83599090576172
14927/28840	That is what I call an elegant mode of attack said Albert You were quite correct in what you said Signor Pastr	54.04946517944336
14928/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo is unquestionably a man of firstrate breeding and knowledge of the	26.85157585144043
14929/28840	Then you accept his offer said the	247.46783447265625
14930/28840	What say you Franz   Oh I agree with you the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided	48.04658889770508
14931/28840	Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would	109.51522064208984
14932/28840	The next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and wouldbe friend the Count of Monte Cristo possessed the ring of Gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this	119.13431549072266
14933/28840	Eight oclock found Franz up and dressed while Albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly	222.44158935546875
14934/28840	The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequious	98.46031188964844
14935/28840	Pray Signor Pastrini asked Franz is not some execution appointed to take place today   Yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too	52.19679641723633
14936/28840	Very possibly I may not go answered Franz but in case I feel disposed give me some particulars of todays	124.00904083251953
14937/28840	What particulars would your excellency like to hear   Why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to	71.8244400024414
14938/28840	That happens just lucky your excellency Only a few minutes ago they brought me the _tavolettas	51.05638885498047
14939/28840	What are they   Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of	102.19668579101562
14940/28840	The reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere	91.51333618164062
14941/28840	And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked Franz somewhat incred	124.037841796875
14942/28840	Upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part Signor Pastrini cried	33.17097091674805
14943/28840	Why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor	45.199031829833984
14944/28840	I see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I	92.68094635009766
14945/28840	Meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these _tavolettas	30.514572143554688
14946/28840	Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber I have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your	55.03452682495117
14947/28840	John Lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit Luigi Vampa and his	33.69003677368164
14948/28840	The firstnamed malefactor will be _mazzolato_ the second culprit _decapitato	25.434484481811523
14949/28840	The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their	113.99657440185547
14950/28840	This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the Colosse	30.6126766204834
14951/28840	No part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous	157.14950561523438
14952/28840	Time was getting on however and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the	105.04716491699219
14953/28840	The anticipated delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual	95.99583435058594
14954/28840	Now my excellent Signor Pastrini said Franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo   Most assuredly replied	29.141584396362305
14955/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early riser and I can answer for his having been up these two	46.487064361572266
14956/28840	Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly   20155m       Oh I am quite	27.672473907470703
14957/28840	I will take all the blame on myself if you find I have led you into an	80.14391326904297
14958/28840	Well then if it be so are you ready Albert   Perfect	75.52436065673828
14959/28840	Let us go and return our best thanks for his	183.84925842285156
14960/28840	The landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said   _I signori Francesi	68.08146667480469
14961/28840	The domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to	200.36407470703125
14962/28840	They passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fittedup drawing	61.96308135986328
14963/28840	The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easychairs and sofas offered their highpiled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refresh	139.62551879882812
14964/28840	Splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the	63.304222106933594
14965/28840	If your excellencies will please to be seated said the man I will let the count know that you are	37.36123275756836
14966/28840	And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried _portières	40.05543899536133
14967/28840	As the door opened the sound of a _guzla_ reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to	61.42142868041992
14968/28840	Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the	37.26569747924805
14969/28840	Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid	218.82583618164062
14970/28840	Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times count returned Albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached	81.1399154663086
14971/28840	Indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit	24.743806838989258
14972/28840	It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini that I did not sooner assist you in your	58.426551818847656
14973/28840	He did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as I am I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my	70.72374725341797
14974/28840	As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my	129.92608642578125
14975/28840	He resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the	70.67385864257812
14976/28840	Moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the count had no hold on Franz who had nothing to	70.66937255859375
14977/28840	However he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his	124.94173431396484
14978/28840	Count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the Rospoli	38.135093688964844
14979/28840	Stay I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps I can render you this slight service	117.67332458496094
14980/28840	He extended his hand and rang the bell thr	57.84764099121094
14981/28840	Did you ever occupy yourself said he to Franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants I	66.18547058105469
14982/28840	When I ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my stewardthus I do not waste a minute or a	62.433372497558594
14983/28840	A man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize	63.247108459472656
14984/28840	It was evident he had his	154.44607543945312
14985/28840	Monsieur Bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo as I ordered you	23.745702743530273
14986/28840	Yes excellency returned the steward but it was very	21.916065216064453
14987/28840	Did I not tell you I wished for one replied the count frown	39.89536666870117
14988/28840	And your excellency has one which was let to Prince Lobanieff but I was obliged to pay a hundred   That will dothat will do Monsieur Bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic	56.81991958618164
14989/28840	You have the window that is	201.60516357421875
14990/28840	Give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to	51.382930755615234
14991/28840	The steward bowed and was about to quit the	27.753101348876953
14992/28840	Ah continued the count be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the _tavoletta_ and if he can send us an account of the	35.79924011230469
14993/28840	There is no need to do that said Franz taking out his tablets for I saw the account and copied it	89.5869140625
14994/28840	Let us know when breakfast is	333.8880615234375
14995/28840	These gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will I trust do me the honor to breakfast with me   But my dear count said Albert we shall abuse your	35.7891845703125
14996/28840	Not at all on the contrary you will give me great	52.91257858276367
14997/28840	You will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at	124.28282928466797
14998/28840	He then took Franzs tablets out of his	80.65498352050781
14999/28840	John Lateran and Peppino called Rocca Priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa and the men of his	24.36457061767578
15000/28840	Hum The first will be _mazzolato_ the second _decapitato	15.5516996383667
15001/28840	Yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the	48.74166488647461
15002/28840	Yes I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two	54.13775634765625
15003/28840	No replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for Peppino called Rocca Pri	26.278257369995117
15004/28840	You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the _mazzolata_ still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very	53.64881134033203
15005/28840	The _mandaïa_6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the suff	86.85885620117188
15006/28840	Ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of European punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of	53.723575592041016
15007/28840	Really count replied Franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the	64.776123046875
15008/28840	There are at least few that I have not seen said the count cold	58.45400619506836
15009/28840	And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles   My first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third	232.05674743652344
15010/28840	I do not quite understand you replied Franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest	81.07764434814453
15011/28840	Listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any	98.88380432128906
15012/28840	I will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by	206.67543029785156
15013/28840	And remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the	103.251220703125
15014/28840	No no continued the count had I to avenge myself it is not thus I would take	66.90328216552734
15015/28840	Then you disapprove of duelling You would not fight a duel asked Albert in his turn astonished at this strange	84.86634826660156
15016/28840	But said Franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the	66.5580062866211
15017/28840	Hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter dra	319.9151916503906
15018/28840	As he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying   _Al suo commodo_   The two young men arose and entered the breakfast	36.609619140625
15019/28840	As for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate	109.31179809570312
15020/28840	This brought back to Franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the Countess G and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a	45.035518646240234
15021/28840	At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his	89.10030364990234
15022/28840	Well said the count what are you doing   You must excuse us count returned Franz but we have still much to	31.88014793395996
15023/28840	What may that be   We have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure	38.799537658691406
15024/28840	Do not concern yourself about that we have I think a private room in the Piazza del Popolo I will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress	73.07579803466797
15025/28840	Opposite the scaffold   The scaffold forms part of the _fête	36.12995147705078
15026/28840	But I warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the	73.63562774658203
15027/28840	You will describe it to me replied Franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed	49.23197555541992
15028/28840	Besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see	79.19305419921875
15029/28840	_Diable_ when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a	88.77003479003906
15030/28840	If you went to Spain would you not see the bullfights Well suppose it is a bullfight you are going to see Recollect the ancient Romans of the Circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred	53.4307746887207
15031/28840	Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said Come despatch the	118.95124816894531
15032/28840	Shall you go then Albert asked	258.1130676269531
15033/28840	_Ma foi_ yes like you I hesitated but the counts eloquence decides	81.33983612060547
15034/28840	Let us go then said Franz since you wish it but on our way to the Piazza del Popolo I wish to pass through the Cor	23.530582427978516
15035/28840	Is this possible count   On foot yes in a carriage	224.16441345214844
15036/28840	Is it important that you should go that way   Yes there is something I wish to	45.96247482299805
15037/28840	Well we will go by the Cor	52.300113677978516
15038/28840	We will send the carriage to wait for us on the Piazza del Popolo by the Via del Babuino for I shall be glad to pass myself through the Corso to see if some orders I have given have been	26.46728515625
15039/28840	Excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to	44.06948471069336
15040/28840	Ah yes returned the count I know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon you will find good cigars on the centre	80.34303283691406
15041/28840	The young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another	55.692630767822266
15042/28840	Albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Café de Paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros	45.988258361816406
15043/28840	Such was Alberts opinion of the count and as Franz well knew that Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change	94.29977416992188
15044/28840	But said he did you observe one very singular thing   What   How attentively he looked at	50.610572814941406
15045/28840	Ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising I have been more than a year absent from Paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a	80.50927734375
15046/28840	The first opportunity you have undeceive him I beg and tell him I am nothing of the	48.411231994628906
15047/28840	Franz smiled an instant after the count	209.1483612060547
15048/28840	I am now quite at your service gentlemen said	34.710975646972656
15049/28840	The carriage is going one way to the Piazza del Popolo and we will go another and if you please by the Cor	28.13599395751953
15050/28840	Take some more of these cigars	715.2132568359375
15051/28840	With all my heart returned Albert Italian cigars are	589.9412841796875
15052/28840	When you come to Paris I will return all	71.1722412109375
15053/28840	I will not refuse I intend going there soon and since you allow me I will pay you a	80.50033569335938
15054/28840	Come we have not any time to lose it is halfpast twelvelet us set	59.394142150878906
15055/28840	All three descended the coachman received his masters orders and drove down the Via del Babu	42.101524353027344
15056/28840	Which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could	75.26759338378906
15057/28840	The three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was	126.66920471191406
15058/28840	Franz glanced rapidly towards the three	96.94573974609375
15059/28840	The side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red	45.542999267578125
15060/28840	The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the	49.5510368347168
15061/28840	Preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with	217.00025939941406
15062/28840	The masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the	73.80622863769531
15063/28840	Franz Albert and the count continued to descend the Cor	82.53428649902344
15064/28840	At the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his	39.062408447265625
15065/28840	The window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the Via del Babuino and the Monte Pinc	52.43039321899414
15066/28840	It consisted as we have said of a small dressingroom opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite	69.61506652832031
15067/28840	On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white sat	136.59434509277344
15068/28840	Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the	44.46797180175781
15069/28840	It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotinewe say guillotine because the Roman _mandaïa_ is formed on almost the same model as the French	54.523921966552734
15070/28840	7 The knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the	118.24192810058594
15071/28840	Two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the	178.32701110839844
15072/28840	Their repast consisted apparently of bread and saus	155.98789978027344
15073/28840	One of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his	131.37301635742188
15074/28840	These two men were the executioners	123.71515655517578
15075/28840	At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his	90.95674896240234
15076/28840	A double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred	61.51398849487305
15077/28840	All the rest of the square was paved with	155.41021728515625
15078/28840	Many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best	155.83847045898438
15079/28840	What the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of	132.40957641601562
15080/28840	And yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the	115.60352325439453
15081/28840	It was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the	42.08927917480469
15082/28840	Suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church	69.52754974365234
15083/28840	A brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the	95.52333068847656
15084/28840	20169m       Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and	32.39400863647461
15085/28840	He was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge	64.35394287109375
15086/28840	He had moreover sandals bound on his feet by	527.0507202148438
15087/28840	Behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first Peppino and then	65.46163177490234
15088/28840	Peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited	172.36318969726562
15089/28840	Each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to	56.7640495300293
15090/28840	At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under	187.56234741210938
15091/28840	He looked at Alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked	89.11041259765625
15092/28840	The count alone seemed unmovednay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale	115.4375
15093/28840	His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jack	75.90072631835938
15094/28840	And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as Franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and	147.05596923828125
15095/28840	However the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became	89.7514419555664
15096/28840	Peppino was a handsome young man of four or fiveandtwenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would	40.10768127441406
15097/28840	Andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be	291.2176208496094
15098/28840	In prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and	76.00801086425781
15099/28840	I thought said Franz to the count that you told me there would be but one	54.99169158935547
15100/28840	I told you true replied he cold	120.53563690185547
15101/28840	Yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to	57.765525817871094
15102/28840	If the pardon is to come there is no time to	56.93607711791992
15103/28840	And see here it is said the	43.16960906982422
15104/28840	At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_ a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded	39.40924835205078
15105/28840	The piercing eye of Peppino had noticed	113.70348358154297
15106/28840	A pardon for Peppino called Rocca Priori said the principal fri	21.97817039489746
15107/28840	And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to	54.410606384277344
15108/28840	For Peppino cried Andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been	42.563682556152344
15109/28840	Why for him and not for me We ought to die	85.83320617675781
15110/28840	I was promised he should die with	94.1717529296875
15111/28840	You have no right to put me to death	82.91007232666016
15112/28840	I will not die aloneI will not   And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his	72.13546752929688
15113/28840	The executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized	31.27967643737793
15114/28840	What is going on asked Franz of the count for as all the talk was in the Roman dialect he had not perfectly understood	54.250362396240234
15115/28840	Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward it is true but he was about to die without	49.858726501464844
15116/28840	Honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation   And the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to	86.49225616455078
15117/28840	However the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to	353.7327575683594
15118/28840	The two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against Andrea and twenty thousand voices cried Put him to death put him to death   Franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the	96.01190185546875
15119/28840	Do you pity him If you heard the cry of Mad dog you would take your gunyou would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another	99.83457946777344
15120/28840	And yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity	132.30197143554688
15121/28840	No nolook look   20172m       The recommendation was	24.849964141845703
15122/28840	Franz was fascinated by the horrible	240.27804565429688
15123/28840	The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his	59.948551177978516
15124/28840	During this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left	50.6713752746582
15125/28840	A dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his	58.00914764404297

15133/28840	Well asked he of the count what has then happened   Nothing replied the count only as you see the Carnival has	50.04218292236328
15134/28840	In fact said Franz this horrible scene has passed away like a	167.31468200683594
15135/28840	It is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed	188.90042114257812
15136/28840	He profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied	88.47199249267578
15137/28840	Decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical	68.623779296875
15138/28840	Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished	76.19731903076172
15139/28840	Well Albert said Franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels Come answer	170.9091033935547
15140/28840	But I am really glad to have seen such a sight and I understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any	65.52165222167969
15141/28840	20175m       Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is	53.225955963134766
15142/28840	It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel Come dress yourselves gentlemen dress	239.5961456298828
15143/28840	Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions	114.81060028076172
15144/28840	He assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own	75.46611785888672

15147/28840	It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken	74.13082122802734
15148/28840	Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the Piazza del Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revel	84.24154663085938
15149/28840	A crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the	133.59764099121094
15150/28840	Franz and Albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the	182.6954345703125
15151/28840	They saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and	80.60296630859375

15164/28840	Franz thanked the count for his	150.43106079101562
15165/28840	As for Albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near	66.27269744873047

15168/28840	Well I am convinced they are all charming	186.35501098632812
15169/28840	How unfortunate that you were masked Albert said Franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappoint	138.2323455810547
15170/28840	Oh replied he half laughing half serious I hope the Carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the	129.72230529785156
15171/28840	But in spite of Alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman	40.17498016357422
15172/28840	At one of these encounters accidentally or purposely Alberts mask fell	72.35911560058594
15173/28840	He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the	43.183143615722656
15174/28840	Doubtless one of the charming females Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of vio	61.668087005615234
15175/28840	Albert seized it and as Franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered Albert to retain	84.4218978881836
15176/28840	Albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly	44.42424011230469
15177/28840	Well said Franz to him there is the beginning of an	61.45183563232422

15181/28840	The jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_ the one who had thrown the violets to Albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button	57.60747146606445
15182/28840	Bravo bravo said Franz things go	630.4110717773438

15185/28840	On my word said Franz you are as wise as Nestor and prudent as Ulysses and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any	51.38880920410156
15186/28840	Albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring	120.16131591796875
15187/28840	Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had	31.945358276367188

15191/28840	Signor Pastrini came to the door to receive his	46.415565490722656
15192/28840	The count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the	65.66722106933594
15193/28840	Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if Signor Pastrini could procure him a	77.08808898925781

15197/28840	The host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their	114.51376342773438

15200/28840	Truth compelled Franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on Pastrinis	60.25522994995117
15201/28840	During dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the	152.05958557128906

15204/28840	They resolved to profit by the counts courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had	118.50885772705078
15205/28840	20181m       This precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the counts	34.334354400634766

15207/28840	Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to	71.2379379272461

15231/28840	The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace  	27.75572967529297

15238/28840	This morning he made two or three exits worthy of Didier or	182.578125
15239/28840	At this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom Franz gave up his seat to	71.99887084960938

15248/28840	The young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to	79.68350982666016
15249/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest	32.28479766845703
15250/28840	He was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all	45.09944152832031
15251/28840	A glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a connoisseur of	40.93701934814453
15252/28840	A few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with	85.94501495361328
15253/28840	The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastr	53.43119430541992

15255/28840	Albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied	83.71695709228516
15256/28840	The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with	99.93631744384766
15257/28840	At halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of Franz and	57.721885681152344

15273/28840	Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next	81.16575622558594

15275/28840	Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his	90.00094604492188
15276/28840	He therefore promised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival from the windows of the Rospoli	52.39999008178711
15277/28840	The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous ep	82.36055755615234
15278/28840	This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored sat	59.24089813232422
15279/28840	The evening was no longer joy but delir	155.58779907226562
15280/28840	Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same	88.4464340209961
15281/28840	Franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his	93.41671752929688
15282/28840	Albert was not deceived for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one	109.79108428955078
15283/28840	Well said he was I mistaken   She has answered you cried	95.08642578125
15284/28840	This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to	139.6626739501953
15285/28840	Franz took the letter and read   Tuesday evening at seven oclock descend from your carriage opposite the Via dei Pontefici and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your torch from	67.02896881103516
15286/28840	When you arrive at the first step of the church of San Giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rosecolored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be	25.64188003540039
15287/28840	Until then you will not see	56.314170837402344
15288/28840	Well asked he when Franz had finished what do you think of that   I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable	44.319427490234375
15289/28840	I think so also replied Albert and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Braccianos	36.69648361206055
15290/28840	Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman	162.77487182617188
15291/28840	All the nobility of Rome will be present and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of society she must go	66.30342102050781
15292/28840	Whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned	182.2450714111328
15293/28840	You have read the letter  	21.146629333496094

15297/28840	You are born to good fortune said Franz as he returned the	83.60789489746094
15298/28840	Laugh as much as you will replied Albert I am in	76.7043685913086
15299/28840	I see that I shall not only go alone to the Duke of Braccianos but also return to Florence	38.00496292114258
15300/28840	If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said Albert I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks at	98.93106842041016

15303/28840	Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was	174.72299194335938
15304/28840	Alberts love had not taken away his	128.61843872070312
15305/28840	He hastened with Franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after	156.6156768798828
15306/28840	After dinner the Count of Monte Cristo was	15.74339771270752
15307/28840	They had not seen him for two	85.06812286376953
15308/28840	Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecch	45.03521728515625
15309/28840	He had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour	69.38378143310547
15310/28840	Whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody	126.62227630615234
15311/28840	The man was an enigma to	94.44853973388672
15312/28840	The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between	103.26052856445312
15313/28840	On his side however great Franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning	79.78650665283203
15314/28840	The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre and were told they were all	61.73981857299805
15315/28840	In consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his	120.27916717529297
15316/28840	Franz and Albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the Palli Theatre the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by	47.58108901977539
15317/28840	This assurance determined the two friends to accept	177.15859985351562
15318/28840	Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first	84.10611724853516
15319/28840	He could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pall	55.26286697387695
15320/28840	Truly a Byronic hero Franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon Manfreds shoulders or beneath Laras	176.793701171875
15321/28840	He was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at	59.92945861816406
15322/28840	And to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet the count seemed to have the power of	64.10943603515625
15323/28840	Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a	114.8790512084961
15324/28840	Franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domine	159.0562286376953
15325/28840	He thought several times of the project the count had of visiting Paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect	87.57282257080078
15326/28840	And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when the count was	40.309688568115234
15327/28840	The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and convers	142.55613708496094
15328/28840	As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated Albert on his	126.11460876464844
15329/28840	They promised upon separating to meet at the Duke of Braccianos ball to which all Rome was	88.35812377929688
15330/28840	The heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave Albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day	125.13067626953125
15331/28840	At length Tuesday came the last and most tumultuous day of the	159.28543090820312
15332/28840	On Tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as Lent begins after eight at	84.66231536865234
15333/28840	On Tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the Carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and	110.69123840332031
15334/28840	The _fêtes_ are veritable pleasure days to the	80.49557495117188
15335/28840	The author of this history who has resided five or six years in Italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other	79.26779174804688
15336/28840	Albert was triumphant in his harlequin	92.9745864868164
15337/28840	A knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the	25.54465103149414
15338/28840	In order that there might be no confusion Franz wore his peasants	178.22201538085938
15339/28840	As the day advanced the tumult became	231.1384735107422
15340/28840	There was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not	87.31909942626953
15341/28840	It was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and noseg	83.75293731689453
15342/28840	At three oclock the sound of fireworks let off on the Piazza del Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to	34.88559341430664
15343/28840	The races like the _moccoli_ are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the	27.669946670532227
15344/28840	At the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent	86.24630737304688
15345/28840	All these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the	51.56940460205078
15346/28840	The pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were	99.29719543457031
15347/28840	A detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the _barberi	55.63750076293945
15348/28840	When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was	36.2295036315918
15349/28840	Almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like	72.92611694335938
15350/28840	Then the Castle of Saint Angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had	380.0333557128906
15351/28840	Immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the Corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite	193.96482849121094
15352/28840	A new source of noise and movement was added to the	258.2314758300781
15353/28840	The sellers of _moccoletti_ entered on the	39.94797134399414
15354/28840	The _moccoletto_ is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from	53.09354782104492
15355/28840	But he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided	107.62631225585938
15356/28840	The _moccoletto_ is kindled by approaching it to a	41.07794189453125
15357/28840	But who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman	48.89957809448242
15358/28840	Everyone hastened to purchase _moccoletti_Franz and Albert among the	35.05510330200195
15359/28840	The night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of _Moccoletti_ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the	59.81840133666992
15360/28840	At the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered descending from the Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo and mounting from the Piazza del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venez	12.327341079711914
15361/28840	It seemed like the _fête_ of Jackolantern	25.615259170532227
15362/28840	It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen	69.43746185302734
15363/28840	Suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the	80.22637939453125

15366/28840	This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the Corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were	136.49700927734375
15367/28840	Every five minutes Albert took out his watch at length it pointed to	133.57867431640625
15368/28840	The two friends were in the Via dei Pontef	47.10721969604492
15369/28840	Albert sprang out bearing his _moccoletto_ in his	23.302108764648438
15370/28840	Two or three masks strove to knock his _moccoletto_ out of his hand but Albert a firstrate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of San Giac	70.09952545166016
15371/28840	The steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each others	184.70721435546875
15372/28840	Franz followed Albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first	66.42174530029297
15373/28840	Instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any	58.835540771484375
15374/28840	Franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw Albert disappear arminarm with the peasant	204.31307983398438
15375/28840	He watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the Via Mace	33.95962142944336
15376/28840	Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival sounded and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished as if by	23.926979064941406
15377/28840	It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished	168.73876953125
15378/28840	No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the	152.0900421142578
15379/28840	The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian   In his whole life perhaps Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this	90.16121673583984
15380/28840	It seemed as though Rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast	143.6934814453125
15381/28840	By a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest	76.09950256347656
15382/28840	The distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the Hôtel de Lond	35.51653289794922
15383/28840	Dinner was waiting but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon Franz sat down without	101.8131103515625
15384/28840	Signor Pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had	61.452980041503906
15385/28840	The sudden extinction of the _moccoletti_ the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in Franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneas	33.057708740234375
15386/28840	He therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted	58.86014938354492
15387/28840	Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as	141.85594177246094
15388/28840	He ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the	37.802825927734375
15389/28840	At eleven oclock Albert had not come	40.684181213378906
15390/28840	Franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of Braccian	41.36292266845703
15391/28840	Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling	84.04734802246094
15392/28840	Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the _moccoli_ and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Mace	15.311933517456055
15393/28840	Then he has not returned said the d	91.26042175292969
15394/28840	I waited for him until this hour replied	94.0445785522461

15396/28840	I think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid	60.196937561035156
15397/28840	And dont you know where he is   Not at	20.095836639404297
15398/28840	Is he armed   He is in mas	72.6633529663086
15399/28840	You should not have allowed him to go said the duke to Franz you who know Rome better than he	56.505985260009766
15400/28840	Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquiet	50.62653732299805
15401/28840	I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night here duke said Franz and desired them to come and inform me of his	59.15291213989258

15403/28840	The duke was not mistaken when he saw Franz the servant came up to	40.90948486328125
15404/28840	Your excellency he said the master of the Hôtel de Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the Viscount of Morcer	13.988810539245605
15405/28840	A letter from the viscount exclaimed	69.07440185546875

15409/28840	Oh said the countess to Franz go with all speedpoor young man Perhaps some accident has happened to	54.92523193359375
15410/28840	Shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the count	66.0561752319336
15411/28840	Yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise I cannot answer as to what I may do	75.56232452392578
15412/28840	Be prudent in any event said the count	51.81279373168945
15413/28840	Franz took his hat and went away in	67.47799682617188
15414/28840	As he came near the hotel Franz saw a man in the middle of the	32.93489074707031
15415/28840	He had no doubt that it was the messenger from	55.16237258911133
15416/28840	The man was wrapped up in a large	55.17442321777344
15417/28840	He went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed	65.58482360839844
15418/28840	What wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his	54.215267181396484

15426/28840	And why   Your excellency will know when you have read the	25.05292510986328
15427/28840	Shall I find you here then  	63.12451171875
15428/28840	On the staircase he met Signor Pastr	26.383081436157227
15429/28840	You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of	69.2050552368164
15430/28840	Yes I have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to	33.08816909790039
15431/28840	Light the candles in my apartment if you	131.87229919433594
15432/28840	The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a	64.21719360351562
15433/28840	The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read Alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded	55.30718231201172
15434/28840	It was written and signed by	249.55076599121094
15435/28840	Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it	192.33602905273438
15436/28840	Run to Torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the	72.26832580566406
15437/28840	It is urgent that I should have this money without	76.7547836303711
15438/28840	I do not say more relying on you as you may rely on	21.852577209472656
15439/28840	Your friend   Albert de Morcer	13.278372764587402
15440/28840	_If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven oclock the Count Albert will have ceased to live	97.87400817871094
15441/28840	This second signature explained everything to Franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for	104.47908020019531
15442/28840	Albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to	51.17775344848633
15443/28840	He hastened to open the _secrétaire_ and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in it the letter of	30.21265411376953
15444/28840	There were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand Albert had already expended three	94.05651092529297
15445/28840	As to Franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at Florence and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty	67.21485900878906
15446/28840	Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert	60.735260009765625
15447/28840	True he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor Torl	39.469520568847656
15448/28840	He was therefore about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his	38.586448669433594
15449/28840	He remembered the Count of Monte Crist	9.118185997009277
15450/28840	Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini when that worthy presented	59.758731842041016
15451/28840	My dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within   Yes your excellency he has this moment	42.5383186340332
15452/28840	Is he in bed   I should say	72.57103729248047
15453/28840	Then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an	42.4754638671875
15454/28840	Signor Pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said   The count awaits your excell	44.04802322387695
15455/28840	Franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the	59.77466583251953
15456/28840	He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with div	45.94246292114258
15457/28840	Well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me It would be very kind of	84.3084945678711
15458/28840	No I have come to speak to you of a very serious	27.434785842895508
15459/28840	A serious matter said the count looking at Franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be   Are we alone   Yes replied the count going to the door and	44.33772277832031
15460/28840	Did you see the postscript   I did	25.6497802734375
15461/28840	_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte Alberto avrà cessato di vive	55.50675582885742
15462/28840	What think you of that inquired	164.69070434570312
15463/28840	Have you the money he demands   Yes all but eight hundred piast	62.04201889038086
15464/28840	The count went to his _secrétaire_ opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to Franz I hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but	45.5208854675293
15465/28840	You see on the contrary I come to you first and instantly replied	85.01495361328125
15466/28840	And I thank you have what you will and he made a sign to Franz to take what he	68.4131088256836
15467/28840	Is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to Luigi Vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the	44.010440826416016
15468/28840	I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said	53.23972702026367
15469/28840	How so returned the count with	115.82865142822266
15470/28840	If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa I am sure he would not refuse you Alberts	43.20479965209961
15471/28840	The count knit his brows and remained silent an	69.72282409667969
15472/28840	And if I went to seek Vampa would you accompany me   If my society would not be disagree	48.48816680908203

15474/28840	Shall I take any arms   For what purpose   Any money   It is	45.62938690185547
15475/28840	Where is the man who brought the letter   In the	20.406484603881836
15476/28840	He awaits the answer  	64.51177215576172
15477/28840	I must learn where we are	53.97369384765625
15478/28840	It is useless he would not come	112.30764770507812
15479/28840	To your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering	171.65658569335938
15480/28840	The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar	55.024818420410156
15481/28840	The man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the	42.81960678100586
15482/28840	_Salite_ said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his	42.807411193847656
15483/28840	The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the	97.04365539550781
15484/28840	Ah it is you Peppino said the	24.602685928344727
15485/28840	But Peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts hand and covered it with	28.081804275512695
15486/28840	Ah said the count you have then not forgotten that I saved your life that is strange for it is a week	43.150604248046875
15487/28840	20203m       No excellency and never shall I forget it returned Peppino with an accent of profound	22.387310028076172
15488/28840	Never That is a long time but it is something that you believe	56.3292121887207
15489/28840	Oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my	33.25627136230469
15490/28840	You allow me to give you this title continued the count in French it is necessary to excite this mans	63.08308029174805
15491/28840	You can speak before me said Franz I am a friend of the	38.9873161315918
15492/28840	I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to	33.314178466796875
15493/28840	How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigis hands   Excellency the Frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was	75.52908325195312
15494/28840	The Frenchman threw her a bouquet Teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the	139.23245239257812
15495/28840	What cried Franz was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants   It was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied Pepp	43.15069580078125
15496/28840	Well then the Frenchman took off his mask Teresa with the chiefs consent did the	180.21815490722656
15497/28840	The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous Teresa gave him oneonly instead of Teresa it was Beppo who was on the steps of the church of San Giac	58.06953811645508
15498/28840	What exclaimed Franz the peasant girl who snatched his _mocoletto_ from him   Was a lad of fifteen replied Pepp	50.766990661621094
15499/28840	But it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived Beppo has taken in plenty of	80.43084716796875
15500/28840	And Beppo led him outside the walls said the	101.93717193603516
15501/28840	Exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Mace	30.48247528076172
15502/28840	Beppo got in inviting the Frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked	113.94326782226562
15503/28840	He gallantly offered the righthand seat to Beppo and sat by	186.24220275878906
15504/28840	Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from Rome the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the	53.516780853271484
15505/28840	The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the	50.65983963012695
15506/28840	At the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the Almo surrounded the	73.97189331054688
15507/28840	The Frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled Beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to	78.43961334228516
15508/28840	They made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to Teresa and Luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of	48.552921295166016
15509/28840	Well said the count turning towards Franz it seems to me that this is a very likely	25.202442169189453
15510/28840	What do you say to it   Why that I should think it very amusing replied Franz if it had happened to anyone but poor	33.804588317871094
15511/28840	And in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious	123.64290618896484
15512/28840	And shall we go and find him inquired	135.4521484375
15513/28840	He is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of	51.924659729003906
15514/28840	Sebastian   I was never in them but I have often resolved to visit	89.09855651855469
15515/28840	Well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a	58.3591194152832
15516/28840	Have you a carriage  	60.792545318603516
15517/28840	That is of no consequence I always have one ready day and	169.81932067871094
15518/28840	I am a very capricious being and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night I resolve on starting for some particular point and away I	82.17245483398438
15519/28840	The count rang and a footman	134.99473571777344
15520/28840	Order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the hol	87.96023559570312
15521/28840	You need not awaken the coachman Ali will	170.08544921875
15522/28840	In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the	24.015316009521484
15523/28840	We might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infid	81.07295989990234
15524/28840	Are you still resolved to accompany me   More determined than	51.749900817871094
15525/28840	Franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by Pepp	41.33644485473633
15526/28840	At the door they found the	76.50200653076172
15527/28840	Ali was on the box in whom Franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Crist	58.74922561645508
15528/28840	Franz and the count got into the	34.967124938964844
15529/28840	Peppino placed himself beside Ali and they set off at a rapid	67.42861938476562
15530/28840	Ali had received his instructions and went down the Corso crossed the Campo Vaccino went up the Strada San Gregorio and reached the gates of	40.07328414916992
15531/28840	The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way and bordered with tom	61.22600555419922
15532/28840	From time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Pepp	70.66482543945312
15533/28840	A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage stopped Peppino opened the door and the count and Franz alight	37.33680725097656
15534/28840	In ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be	33.06834030151367
15535/28840	He then took Peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and Peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the	55.908504486083984
15536/28840	Five minutes elapsed during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous	87.15495300292969
15537/28840	Now said the count let us follow	44.82501220703125
15538/28840	Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small	38.80412673950195
15539/28840	They then perceived two men conversing in the	149.62704467773438
15540/28840	Ought we to go on asked Franz of the count or should we pause   Let us go on Peppino will have warned the sentry of our	58.3110237121582
15541/28840	One of the two men was Peppino and the other a bandit on the	26.513408660888672
15542/28840	Franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted	52.6276969909668
15543/28840	Your excellency said Peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at	42.747074127197266
15544/28840	They came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely	39.43438720703125
15545/28840	Peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage	83.671142578125
15546/28840	Peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after	81.21592712402344
15547/28840	The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him	245.95460510253906
15548/28840	The passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one	124.71929931640625
15549/28840	They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by Who comes there At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine	61.97732162475586
15550/28840	A friend responded Peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might	38.08857345581055
15551/28840	Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty	168.3704071044922
15552/28840	Franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary	93.98912048339844
15553/28840	Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catac	61.33099365234375
15554/28840	Down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were	83.2416763305664
15555/28840	The count laid his hand on Franzs	106.29241943359375
15556/28840	Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he	180.27169799804688
15557/28840	Peppino obeyed and Franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since Peppino had put out his torch was visible along the	54.635780334472656
15558/28840	They advanced silently the count guiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the	75.69496154785156
15559/28840	Franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a	124.63077545166016
15560/28840	Three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a	200.72171020507812
15561/28840	These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have	58.20027160644531
15562/28840	In the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted	104.23067474365234
15563/28840	A lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the	59.45498275756836
15564/28840	A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the newcomers contemplated	59.95015335083008
15565/28840	This was the chief of the band Luigi V	55.9515495300293
15566/28840	Around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within	90.03541564941406
15567/28840	At the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than	81.0258560180664
15568/28840	Who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamplight a shadow approaching his	92.76313781738281
15569/28840	At this challenge Vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his gird	53.043853759765625
15570/28840	In a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the	58.79700469970703
15571/28840	Well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear Vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of	39.00810623168945
15572/28840	It seems that your memory is equally short in everything Vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with	111.72821807861328
15573/28840	What conditions have I forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair	35.75801467895508
15574/28840	Why did you not tell me all thisyou inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his	72.86425018310547
15575/28840	Are you not alone asked Vampa with uneas	37.22673797607422

15577/28840	Come your excellency the count added turning to Franz here is Luigi Vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has	63.20408630371094
15578/28840	Franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet	136.6295166015625

15583/28840	The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Alberts prison and Franz and the count followed	60.12034606933594
15584/28840	What is the prisoner doing inquired Vampa of the sent	110.3836898803711

15586/28840	The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a	92.9194107055664
15587/28840	Then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound sl	39.16178894042969
15588/28840	Come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow	27.678041458129883
15589/28840	Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of	40.99159240722656
15590/28840	You are right your excellency he said this must be one of your	24.872234344482422
15591/28840	Then going to Albert he touched him on the shoulder saying Will your excellency please to awaken   Albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his	37.81311798095703
15592/28840	Oh said he is it you captain You should have allowed me to	66.73976135253906
15593/28840	I was dancing the galop at Torlonias with the Countess	40.403663635253906
15594/28840	Then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time	68.24649047851562

15596/28840	My dear fellow replied Albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future Napoleons maxim Never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on I should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my	68.50066375732422
15597/28840	So then they have paid my ransom   No your excell	34.310447692871094
15598/28840	Well then how am I free   A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand	82.33978271484375
15599/28840	Really Then that person is a most amiable	181.33636474609375
15600/28840	What said he is it you my dear Franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed   No not I replied Franz but our neighbor the Count of Monte Crist	61.3335075378418
15601/28840	My dear Albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlon	60.795475006103516
15602/28840	You may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no illwill to Signor Luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a	119.98262023925781
15603/28840	You are decidedly right and we may reach the Palazzo by two o	32.43095397949219
15604/28840	Signor Luigi continued Albert is there any formality to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency   None sir replied the bandit you are as free as	72.30579376220703
15605/28840	Well then a happy and merry life to	200.2476348876953
15606/28840	And Albert followed by Franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in	96.64067077636719
15607/28840	Peppino said the brigand chief give me the	52.19013595581055

15611/28840	And now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has	35.28386306762695
15612/28840	No my dear Vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed	81.73726654052734
15613/28840	20214m       Gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever I may be you shall be	41.1876106262207
15614/28840	The count went out first then	336.7438659667969
15615/28840	Has your excellency anything to ask me said Vampa with a	30.997028350830078
15616/28840	Yes I have replied Franz I am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we	49.61323928833008
15617/28840	Cæsars _Commentaries_ said the bandit it is my favorite	35.28054428100586
15618/28840	Yes replied Franz here I am and he in his turn left the	73.4898910522461
15619/28840	Ah your pardon said Albert turning round will you allow me captain   And he lighted his cigar at Vampas	61.84899139404297
15620/28840	Now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we	70.56549835205078
15621/28840	I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Braccian	32.643943786621094
15622/28840	They found the carriage where they had left	82.6046371459961
15623/28840	The count said a word in Arabic to Ali and the horses went on at great	132.91400146484375
15624/28840	It was just two oclock by Alberts watch when the two friends entered into the dancing	52.25706100463867
15625/28840	Their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on Alberts account ceased	111.876953125
15626/28840	And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of	64.73968505859375
15627/28840	In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to	38.69826126098633
15628/28840	My very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exert	57.040321350097656
15629/28840	I am wholly a stranger to Parisit is a city I have never yet	74.24006652832031
15630/28840	Is it possible exclaimed Albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world I can scarcely credit	85.01005554199219
15631/28840	So distinguished an individual as yourself cried Albert could scarcely have required an	300.8863830566406
15632/28840	You are most kind but as regards myself I can find no merit I possess save that as a millionaire I might have become a partner in the speculations of	64.44062805175781
15633/28840	Rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks I stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into	187.7353057861328
15634/28840	Your offer however smooths all difficulties and I have only to ask you my dear	84.89966583251953
15635/28840	Connected by marriage you mean said Franz laugh	234.95175170898438
15636/28840	Well never mind how it is answered Albert it comes to the same thing in the	81.14730072021484
15637/28840	Then it is settled said the count and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long med	75.66710662841797
15638/28840	And in three months time said Albert you will be at my house   Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my	81.95680236816406
15639/28840	Day for day hour for hour said Albert that will suit me to a	140.80812072753906
15640/28840	So be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the 21st of February and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten o	39.800418853759766
15641/28840	Now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the fore	57.606536865234375
15642/28840	Capital exclaimed Albert your breakfast shall be	268.13824462890625
15643/28840	Where do you live  	19.949478149414062
15644/28840	Have you bachelors apartments there I hope my coming will not put you to any	107.54556274414062
15645/28840	I reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main	57.34857940673828

15648/28840	Now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than	107.38758850097656
15649/28840	Shall I see you again ere my departure asked	83.22020721435547
15650/28840	That depends when do you leave   Tomorrow evening at five o	54.1532096862793
15651/28840	In that case I must say adieu to you as I am compelled to go to Naples and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday	66.43035125732422
15652/28840	And you baron pursued the count addressing Franz do you also depart tomorrow  	86.09394836425781
15653/28840	For France   No for Venice I shall remain in Italy for another year or	54.61924362182617
15654/28840	Then we shall not meet in Paris   I fear I shall not have that	41.22534942626953
15655/28840	Well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant	77.43568420410156
15656/28840	It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a	64.69796752929688
15657/28840	20219m       Let us understand each other said Albert it is agreedis it notthat you are to be at	34.18328094482422

15659/28840	The young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the	32.2882080078125
15660/28840	What is the matter asked Albert of Franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly	72.07856750488281
15661/28840	I will confess to you Albert replied Franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehens	41.824462890625
15662/28840	My dear fellow exclaimed Albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness Why you must have lost your	80.89359283447266
15663/28840	Whether I am in my senses or not answered Franz that is the way I	69.05516815185547
15664/28840	Listen to me Franz said Albert I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to	113.21397399902344
15665/28840	Have you anything particular against him  	177.44967651367188
15666/28840	Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither   I	81.74151611328125
15667/28840	And where   Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you   I	21.503231048583984
15668/28840	Upon your honor   Upon my	35.0103874206543
15669/28840	Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two Corsican bandits with	41.69649124145508
15670/28840	He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the _Thousand and One Nights	25.27361297607422
15671/28840	Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum between the count and Vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully	71.06714630126953
15672/28840	Albert listened with the most profound	40.800514221191406
15673/28840	Well said he when Franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related The count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his	140.48239135742188
15674/28840	Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this	92.7948989868164
15675/28840	Still persisted Franz I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your	99.39900207519531
15676/28840	My dear Franz replied Albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger help me to deliver	97.79769134521484
15677/28840	Was not that nearly what you said   20222m       It	17.0779972076416
15678/28840	Well then did he ask you Who is	291.4400329589844
15679/28840	Albert de Morcerf how does he come by his namehis fortune what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native Tell me did he put all these questions to you   I confess he asked me	85.85665893554688
15680/28840	No he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa where I can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern I did not very particularly care to	49.01602554321289
15681/28840	And this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on Alberts	66.73011779785156
15682/28840	Well said Franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of ref	67.59567260742188
15683/28840	Still in spite of all you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular person	25.22356605529785
15684/28840	He is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and	119.1172103881836
15685/28840	If my vote and interest can obtain it for him I will readily give him the one and promise the	110.0238265991211
15686/28840	And now my dear Franz let us talk of something	38.480255126953125
15687/28840	Come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to	63.324485778808594
15688/28840	Peters   Franz silently assented and the following afternoon at halfpast five oclock the young men	104.64385986328125

15690/28840	The Guests   In the house in the Rue du Helder where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the	40.03091049194336
15691/28840	Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants	65.03221893310547
15692/28840	Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the	103.1335220336914
15693/28840	Between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcer	51.50318908691406
15694/28840	A high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage	78.65121459960938

15696/28840	It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for	97.34327697753906
15697/28840	There were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded	58.992916107177734
15698/28840	By means of the two windows looking into the street Albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thorough	87.17385864257812
15699/28840	Then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the _concierges_ door and which merits a particular	80.13665008544922
15700/28840	It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the welloiled hinges and locks told quite another	166.794189453125

15873/28840	Yes but what you do not know is that I was carried off by	39.57929229736328
15874/28840	Yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for I found them ugly enough to frighten	109.20172119140625
15875/28840	Come my dear Albert said Debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes and that like Madame de Maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a	36.95391845703125
15876/28840	Say so at once we are sufficiently wellbred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to	100.81012725830078
15877/28840	And I say to you fabulous as it may seem I tell it as a true one from beginning to	119.82127380371094
15878/28840	The brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the Catacombs of Saint	52.602108001708984
15879/28840	I know it said ChâteauRenaud I narrowly escaped catching a fever	49.5433349609375
15880/28840	And I did more than that replied Morcerf for I caught	51.24665069580078
15881/28840	I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4000 Roman crownsabout 24000 franc	50.33236312866211
15882/28840	I was at the end of my journey and of my	38.04545211791992
15883/28840	But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns said ChâteauRen	15.840084075927734
15884/28840	A man whose name is Franz dÉpinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring	29.2977237701416
15885/28840	No he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to	110.54808044433594
15886/28840	Ah this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus a Perseus freeing	99.48701477050781
15887/28840	No he is a man about my own	64.06900787353516
15888/28840	Armed to the teeth   He had not even a knittingneed	79.96408081054688
15889/28840	But he paid your ransom   He said two words to the chief and I was	84.31898498535156
15890/28840	And they apologized to him for having carried you off said Beauch	65.21867370605469
15891/28840	No his name is the Count of Monte Crist	11.43761920928955
15892/28840	There is no Count of Monte Cristo said Debr	16.035757064819336
15893/28840	I do not think so added ChâteauRenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the European nobility	19.68360137939453
15894/28840	Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo   He comes possibly from the Holy Land and one of his ancestors possessed Calvary as the Mortemarts did the Dead	71.81169891357422
15895/28840	I think I can assist your researches said Maximil	20.294404983520508
15896/28840	Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employeda grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean an atom in the	85.22626495361328
15897/28840	Well he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in Tusc	89.95894622802734
15898/28840	He is rich then   I believe	23.774188995361328
15899/28840	Which means   Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those	26.897687911987305
15900/28840	He has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself Sinbad the Sailor and has a cave filled with	54.651336669921875
15901/28840	And you have seen this cavern Morcerf asked Beauch	47.75058364868164
15902/28840	No but Franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before	105.08594512939453
15903/28840	Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strump	103.2804183959961
15904/28840	Only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of	90.76433563232422
15905/28840	The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to sayAre you mad or are you laughing at us   And I also said Morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named Penel	44.828067779541016
15906/28840	Ah cried Albert it is very lucky that	61.15571975708008
15907/28840	Morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth   My dear Albert said Debray what you tell us is so	50.427433013916016
15908/28840	Ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of themthey have no	128.44407653808594
15909/28840	They are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who	104.50269317626953
15910/28840	Now you get angry and attack our poor	707.813720703125
15911/28840	How will you have them protect you The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely	156.74664306640625
15912/28840	Will you be ambassador Albert I will send you to	247.27613830566406
15913/28840	No lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali the Sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle	112.71437072753906
15914/28840	Yes said Albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the Count of Monte Crist	15.714386940002441
15915/28840	Doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an Arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and Greek mist	164.5182647705078
15916/28840	Have you seen the Greek mistress   I have both seen and heard	91.17982482910156
15917/28840	I saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when I breakfasted with the	74.12149810791016
15918/28840	He eats then   Yes but so little it can hardly be called	101.82797241210938
15919/28840	Laugh if you will the Countess G who knew Lord Ruthven declared that the count was a	68.69043731689453
15920/28840	For a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous seaserpent of the _Constitutionnel	39.776771545410156
15921/28840	Wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said Debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexception	91.93856811523438
15922/28840	Just so Lucien returned Morcerf you have described him feature for	82.39704895019531
15923/28840	This man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution I thought I should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the	66.5328140258789
15924/28840	Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your blood asked Beauch	37.035518646240234
15925/28840	Or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birthright   Rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said Morcerf somewhat piqu	146.49822998046875
15926/28840	When I look at you Parisians idlers on the Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same	29.64948844909668
15927/28840	At the same time added ChâteauRenaud your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditt	28.580495834350586
15928/28840	There are no Italian banditti said Debr	66.60029602050781
15929/28840	No Count of Monte Cristo added Debr	11.503867149353027
15930/28840	20243m       Confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued Beauch	29.269134521484375
15931/28840	But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced His excellency the Count of Monte Crist	25.0946044921875
15932/28840	The involuntary start everyone gave proved how much Morcerfs narrative had impressed them and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden	168.96926879882812
15933/28840	He had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiseless	53.68156814575195
15934/28840	The count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his	79.14247131347656
15935/28840	Every article of dresshat coat gloves and bootswas from the first	446.4497985839844
15936/28840	But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had	141.5585479736328
15937/28840	The count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached Albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial	57.013153076171875
15938/28840	Punctuality said Monte Cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns I think but it is not the same with	69.58271026611328
15939/28840	However I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in France where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postil	58.3543586730957
15940/28840	My dear count replied Albert I was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom I now present to	55.07514190673828
15941/28840	They are the Count of ChâteauRenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table	42.504600524902344
15942/28840	Lucien Debray private secretary to the minister of the interior	37.13810729980469
15943/28840	Beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the French government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in Italy since his paper is prohibited there and	73.26256561279297
15944/28840	At this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale	85.07623291015625
15945/28840	You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome	62.918304443359375
15946/28840	No one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he	113.85804748535156
15947/28840	You have never seen our Africans count said	58.08236312866211
15948/28840	Never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself	78.18434143066406
15949/28840	Well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole	62.121681213378906
15950/28840	And we have just heard continued Albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although I have seen him today for the first time I request you to allow me to introduce him as my	52.41297149658203
15951/28840	At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show	176.76419067382812
15952/28840	Ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the	25.259506225585938
15953/28840	This exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what Albert was saying surprised everybody and especially Morrel who looked at Monte Cristo with	89.05264282226562
15954/28840	But at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at	66.32691192626953
15955/28840	20245m       Why should he doubt it said Beauchamp to ChâteauRen	7.93405818939209
15956/28840	In reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in Monte Cristo Albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular	56.802040100097656
15957/28840	What say you Morrel   _Ma foi_ he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about	42.54201126098633
15958/28840	Gentlemen said Albert Germain informs me that breakfast is	282.7339782714844
15959/28840	My dear count allow me to show you the	47.50162887573242
15960/28840	They passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his	135.82321166992188
15961/28840	Gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may	99.34478759765625
15962/28840	I am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time I have ever been at	28.637062072753906
15963/28840	The French way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the Paris	77.7991714477539
15964/28840	I beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish too Italian or too	153.30665588378906
15965/28840	With what an air he says all this muttered Beauchamp decidedly he is a great	85.58023071289062
15966/28840	A great man in his own country added Debr	47.381103515625
15967/28840	A great man in every country	258.35699462890625
15968/28840	The count was it may be remembered a most temperate	421.71197509765625
15969/28840	Albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential	126.22344970703125
15970/28840	My dear count said he I fear one thing and that is that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di Sp	23.809398651123047
15971/28840	I ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared	102.28926849365234
15972/28840	I eat everywhere and of everything only I eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for I have not eaten since yesterday	121.40422821044922
15973/28840	And you ate in your carriage asked Morcer	43.811622619628906
15974/28840	No I slept as I generally do when I am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to	113.7809829711914
15975/28840	But you can sleep when you please monsieur said Mor	20.22332191467285
15976/28840	You have a recipe for it   An infallible	46.04368591308594
15977/28840	That would be invaluable to us in Africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to	112.8553237915039
15978/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was	63.7012939453125
15979/28840	May we inquire what is this recipe asked Debr	54.72599792480469
15980/28840	Oh yes returned Monte Cristo I make no secret of	42.74534225463867
15981/28840	It is a mixture of excellent opium which I fetched myself from Canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the Eastthat is between the Tigris and the Euph	47.37784957885742
15982/28840	These two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into	335.03936767578125
15983/28840	Ten minutes after one is taken the effect is	369.5476379394531
15984/28840	Ask Baron Franz dÉpinay I think he tasted them one	35.55329895019531
15985/28840	Yes replied Morcerf he said something about it to	15.332104682922363
15986/28840	But said Beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you  	101.36579895019531
15987/28840	Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued Beauchamp hoping to take him at a	80.49119567871094
15988/28840	This ball had an acrid and penetrating	286.1842346191406
15989/28840	There were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a	91.45270538330078
15990/28840	The casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to	85.06888580322266
15991/28840	And is it your cook who prepares these pills asked Beauch	85.99523162841797
15992/28840	Oh no monsieur replied Monte Cristo I do not thus betray my enjoyments to the	43.815589904785156
15993/28840	I am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills	87.85459899902344
15994/28840	This is a magnificent emerald and the largest I have ever seen said ChâteauRenaud although my mother has some remarkable family	39.42087936401367
15995/28840	I had three similar ones returned Monte Crist	60.11615753173828
15996/28840	I gave one to the Sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the Pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor Pius	140.7471160888672
15997/28840	I kept the third for myself and I had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I	124.67303466796875
15998/28840	Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was	32.958038330078125
15999/28840	However the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former	67.5815200805664
16000/28840	And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked Debr	96.19832611083984
16001/28840	The Sultan the liberty of a woman replied the Count the Pope the life of a man so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a	61.451541900634766
16002/28840	And it was Peppino you saved was it not cried Morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon   Perhaps returned the count	55.68132019042969
16003/28840	My dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said Morcer	54.766849517822266
16004/28840	For example here is Debray who reads and Beauchamp who prints every day A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the Rue	45.56599426269531
16005/28840	Tell them yourself that I was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of	70.17584228515625
16006/28840	Sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du He	78.85186004638672
16007/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo you promised me never to mention that	44.907325744628906
16008/28840	It was not I who made that promise cried Morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have	57.17345428466797
16009/28840	Pray speak of it for I shall not only I trust relate the little I do know but also a great deal I do not	62.39516067504883
16010/28840	It seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what	90.87004089355469
16011/28840	20249m       Well you promise me if I tell all I know to relate in your turn all that I do not know   That is but fair replied Monte Crist	24.083826065063477
16012/28840	The letter is still to be seen for it is in Franz dÉpinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of	67.88774108886719
16013/28840	This is all I know but I know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who ordinarily have so little respect for	76.64641571044922
16014/28840	I assure you Franz and I were lost in	91.4811782836914
16015/28840	I had known the famous Vampa for more than ten	66.45716094970703
16016/28840	In after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was I who captured him and a dozen of his	59.24219512939453
16017/28840	I might have handed him over to Roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but I did nothing of the sortI suffered him and his band to	114.69579315185547
16018/28840	With the condition that they should sin no more said Beauchamp	76.98684692382812
16019/28840	No monsieur returned Monte Cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my	34.197635650634766

16023/28840	How have I deviated from those principles monsieur asked Monte Cristo who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing	34.93604278564453

16028/28840	My dear vicomte returned Monte Cristo I do not see in all I have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies I have	49.6254768371582
16029/28840	I will appeal to any of these gentlemen could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him Besides you know I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to	59.05717086791992

16067/28840	Thanks monsieur said Monte Cristo I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already	33.13680648803711

16069/28840	Was I so badly lodged at Rome said Monte Cristo	83.23806762695312
16070/28840	_Parbleu_ at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every	49.05812454223633
16071/28840	It is not that which deterred me replied Monte Cristo but as I determined to have a house to myself I sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished	43.33286666870117
16072/28840	But you have then a valet de chambre who knows Paris said Beauch	23.696046829223633
16073/28840	It is the first time he has ever been in	31.24466896057129
16074/28840	He is black and cannot speak returned Monte Crist	77.48067474365234
16075/28840	It is Ali cried Albert in the midst of the general	80.2889175415039

16077/28840	Certainly said Morcerf I recollect him	32.709869384765625
16078/28840	But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything	121.31494140625
16079/28840	Undeceive yourself monsieur replied Monte Cristo I am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as I	24.81726837158203
16080/28840	He knows my tastes my caprices my	181.0312957763672
16081/28840	He has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by	108.32256317138672
16082/28840	He knew that I should arrive today at ten oclock he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de Fontaineble	24.168054580688477
16083/28840	He gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and Monte Cristo passed a paper to	88.90042114257812
16084/28840	Ah that is really original said Beauch	46.86310577392578
16085/28840	What do you not know your house asked Debr	17.12937355041504
16086/28840	No said Monte Cristo I told you I did not wish to be behind my time I dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts	37.83113479614258
16087/28840	I in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to	150.16424560546875
16088/28840	Thanks monsieur returned Monte Cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each	28.718481063842773
16089/28840	Is your steward also a Nubian asked Debr	32.653568267822266
16090/28840	No he is a countryman of yours if a Corsican is a countryman of any	59.170799255371094
16091/28840	Bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well   Yes you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smugglerin fact	55.95581817626953
16092/28840	I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some triflea stab with a knife for	41.04302978515625
16093/28840	And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said Debr	41.849830627441406
16094/28840	Of how much does he rob you every year   On my word replied the count not more than	52.788936614990234
16095/28840	I am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so I keep	119.20164489746094
16096/28840	Then continued ChâteauRenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the ChampsÉlysées you only want a	25.11890983581543
16097/28840	He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the counts box at the Argentina and Valle theat	45.38512420654297
16098/28840	I have something better than that said Monte Cristo I have a	18.60335922241211
16099/28840	You procure your mistresses from the opera the Vaudeville or the Variétés I purchased mine at Constantinople it cost me more but I have nothing to	96.59473419189453
16100/28840	But you forget replied Debray laughing that we are Franks by name and franks by nature as King Charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes	88.42919158935547
16101/28840	Who will tell her   The first person who sees	44.3259162902832
16102/28840	But at least we shall see her said Beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes   Oh no replied Monte Cristo I do not carry brutalism so	34.7144775390625
16103/28840	Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit	59.15937042236328
16104/28840	They had long since passed to dessert and	527.7674560546875
16105/28840	My dear Albert said Debray rising it is halfpast	39.63309097290039
16106/28840	Your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst	165.88491821289062
16107/28840	I will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he	23.942493438720703
16108/28840	Take care returned Albert no one has been able to accomplish	108.79708862304688
16109/28840	Oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this	88.80826568603516
16110/28840	And when you know will you tell me   I promise	26.064035415649414
16111/28840	As he left the room Debray called out loudly My	81.7130355834961
16112/28840	Bravo said Beauchamp to Albert I shall not go to the Chamber but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of	48.530738830566406
16113/28840	For heavens sake Beauchamp returned Morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him	48.28143310546875
16114/28840	Is he not peculiar   He is more than that replied ChâteauRenaud he is one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my	29.64868927001953
16115/28840	Are you coming Morrel   Directly I have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at Rue Meslay	41.397552490234375
16116/28840	Be sure I shall not fail to do so returned the count b	41.64945602416992
16117/28840	And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de ChâteauRenaud leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcer	14.557076454162598
16118/28840	The Presentation   When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo My dear count said he allow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you a specimen of a bachelors	46.97158432006836
16119/28840	You who are accustomed to the palaces of Italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can	105.70368957519531
16120/28840	As we pass from one room to another I will open the windows to let you	134.0899658203125
16121/28840	Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground	40.61391830444336
16122/28840	Albert led him first to his _atelier_ which was as we have said his favorite	68.77125549316406
16123/28840	Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all that Albert had collected hereold cabinets Japanese porcelain Oriental stuffs Venetian glass arms from all parts of the worldeverything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their	74.45237731933594
16124/28840	Morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural	67.22921752929688
16125/28840	They descended to the first floor Albert led his guest into the	80.70103454589844
16126/28840	From the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple	52.83299255371094
16127/28840	A single portrait signed by Léopold Robert shone in its carved and gilded	83.59951782226562
16128/28840	This portrait attracted the Count of Monte Cristos attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before	67.29409790039062
16129/28840	It was the portrait of a young woman of five or sixandtwenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long	56.90541458129883
16130/28840	She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her	45.58565902709961
16131/28840	She was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and	61.182960510253906
16132/28840	The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the counts visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and	85.8652572631836
16133/28840	Silence prevailed for an instant during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the	47.46718978881836
16134/28840	You have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumea ball costume doubtlessbecomes her admir	85.15939331054688
16135/28840	Ah monsieur returned Albert I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside	53.99441146850586
16136/28840	You do not know my mother she it is whom you see	46.72556686401367
16137/28840	She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years	164.51339721679688
16138/28840	This costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in	90.1192626953125
16139/28840	The countess had this portrait painted during the counts	146.16761779785156
16140/28840	She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of Léopold Robert could not overcome his dislike to	64.60261535644531
16141/28840	It is true between ourselves that	267.99432373046875
16142/28840	de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of	41.67949676513672
16143/28840	It is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease	78.16320037841797
16144/28840	de Morcerf whose portrait by Gros I will also show	118.96492004394531
16145/28840	Excuse my talking of family matters but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this	62.41685104370117
16146/28840	The picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without	157.61898803710938
16147/28840	This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their	68.33678436279297
16148/28840	20261m       Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his	20.650392532348633
16149/28840	Now said Albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they	47.57502746582031
16150/28840	Consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of	73.21056365966797
16151/28840	de Morcerf he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom I announced your promised visit and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in	102.69417572021484
16152/28840	You are somewhat _blasé_ I know and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor who has seen so many	60.5105094909668

16154/28840	Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a	95.38687133789062
16155/28840	Albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint	129.99977111816406
16156/28840	and Madame de Morcerf of the arrival of the Count of Monte Crist	8.24056339263916
16157/28840	When they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this bl	57.394840240478516

16162/28840	Besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the customhouse	58.412376403808594
16163/28840	Excuse my putting such a question to	232.39459228515625
16164/28840	It is not indiscreet returned Morcerf with the simplicity of	58.5933952331543
16165/28840	These are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my	128.3588409423828

16314/28840	Bertuccio   I cried the steward with a strange	34.88286590576172
16315/28840	His excellency did not charge me to purchase this	46.658084869384766
16316/28840	If his excellency will recollectif he will think   Ah true observed Monte Cristo I recollect	31.230749130249023

16320/28840	And you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his	48.26312255859375
16321/28840	It is a charming place well supplied with springwater and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought	189.8604278564453

16323/28840	_Peste_ let us not lose such an opportunity returned Monte Crist	46.282779693603516
16324/28840	And he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the propriet	64.54817199707031
16325/28840	Bertuccio said he give fiftyfive thousand francs to monsie	29.96196746826172
16326/28840	The steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of banknotes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all	52.70358657836914
16327/28840	And now demanded the count are all the forms complied with   All	133.9374237060547

16333/28840	Well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite	54.50288009643555
16334/28840	The notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar	41.15509033203125
16335/28840	See this gentleman out said the count to Bertucc	46.94285583496094

16343/28840	You know the environs of Paris then   No excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which Monte Cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquiet	37.432106018066406
16344/28840	It is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for I wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful	75.31398010253906

16346/28840	Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any	47.110084533691406
16347/28840	Why what has happened to youare you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked Monte Cristo in the same tone that Louis	31.626420974731445
16348/28840	pronounced the famous I have been almost obliged to	108.57962799072266

16354/28840	Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewards extraordinary repugnance for the counts projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little	109.81349182128906
16355/28840	In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to augment as they entered the	58.25868606567383

16359/28840	Bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanRue de la Fontaine	61.490909576416016

16375/28840	Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from	60.66032791137695
16376/28840	And is not this daughter dead demanded Monte Cristo I fancy I have heard	94.99211883544922

16383/28840	The steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to	50.869407653808594
16384/28840	They went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the	78.0635986328125
16385/28840	Ah here is a private staircase said the count that is	51.5129280090332

16401/28840	The steward wished to turn to the	40.240482330322266

16408/28840	Monsieur I implore you do not stay there   I think you are going mad Bertuccio said the count cold	20.28237533569336
16409/28840	If that is the case I warn you I shall have you put in a lunatic	20.26981544494629
16410/28840	Alas excellency returned Bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous	53.79092788696289
16411/28840	Alas excellency the evil has arrived  	59.354644775390625
16412/28840	I knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and I overlooked that in Italy because in Italy those things are thought nothing	90.34838104248047

16419/28840	I do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus	46.368656158447266
16420/28840	It is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a	124.8338851928711
16421/28840	Oh your excellency returned Bertuccio in deep	24.720321655273438
16422/28840	Or as you are a Corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call	61.13798904418945

16429/28840	This is strange returned Monte Cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much	64.0318374633789
16430/28840	Monsieur said the steward it is fatality I am	21.58328628540039

16462/28840	No monsieur and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but	33.44276809692383
16463/28840	I had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of Cors	77.10382080078125

16467/28840	But that is the history of the Hundred Days	36.52692413330078
16468/28840	Bertuccio said the count unless I am mistaken it has been already	57.832611083984375
16469/28840	Excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be	84.05880737304688
16470/28840	Go on I will keep my	113.50678253173828
16471/28840	I should tell you that we lived in the little village of Rogliano at the extremity of Cap Cor	35.02161407470703
16472/28840	In the smuggling line said Monte Crist	49.66254425048828
16473/28840	I loved my brother tenderly as I told your excellency and I resolved not to send the money but to take it to him	31.212377548217773
16474/28840	I left five hundred with Assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred I set off for Nî	56.434329986572266
16475/28840	It was easy to do so and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my	136.9995574951172
16476/28840	But after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhô	47.07786178588867
16477/28840	At last however we succeeded and worked up to Ar	177.7281951904297
16478/28840	I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire and took the road to Nî	19.447418212890625
16479/28840	We are getting to the story now   Yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see I only tell you what is absolutely	33.390480041503906
16480/28840	Just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of	39.0805778503418
16481/28840	Three brigands called Trestaillon Truphemy and Graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapart	115.40959167480469
16482/28840	You have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency   Vaguely I was far from France at that	29.499650955200195
16483/28840	As I entered Nîmes I literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and	166.3388671875
16484/28840	My misgivings had been but too	210.29849243164062
16485/28840	My brother had arrived the previous evening at Nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been	27.759368896484375
16486/28840	I did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they	79.23143005371094
16487/28840	I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much and which feared nothing and I went to the kings	56.253787994384766
16488/28840	And this kings attorney was named Villefort asked Monte Cristo care	49.94894790649414
16489/28840	Yes your excellency he came from Marseilles where he had been deputy procure	30.630577087402344
16490/28840	His zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the Island of El	31.944812774658203
16491/28840	Then said Monte Cristo you went to him   Monsieur I said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of Nîmes I know not by whom but it is your duty to find	27.790571212768555
16492/28840	You are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to	58.70595932006836

16500/28840	All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly	108.72366333007812
16501/28840	Pray try and obtain a small government pension for	384.19342041015625
16502/28840	Every revolution has its catastrophes returned	257.6900329589844
16503/28840	de Villefort your brother has been the victim of	40.579994201660156
16504/28840	It is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his	150.19189453125
16505/28840	If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to	66.07608795166016
16506/28840	What has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of repris	119.94194030761719
16507/28840	What cried I do you a magistrate speak thus to me   All these Corsicans are mad on my honor replied	50.71796798706055
16508/28840	de Villefort they fancy that their countryman is still	165.34144592285156
16509/28840	You have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late	85.57990264892578
16510/28840	Go now at once or I shall have you put	64.17259979248047
16511/28840	I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreat	55.449222564697266
16512/28840	But he was a man of	29.470821380615234
16513/28840	I approached him and said in a low voice Well since you know the Corsicans so well you know that they always keep their	56.362823486328125
16514/28840	You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a Bonapartist because you are a royal	39.674983978271484
16515/28840	Well I who am a Bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that I will kill	56.44340133666992
16516/28840	From this moment I declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has	85.6734390258789
16517/28840	And before he had recovered from his surprise I opened the door and left the	43.056396484375
16518/28840	Well well said Monte Cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things	81.29373168945312
16519/28840	Bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that But did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta   He knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and	79.3428955078125
16520/28840	Fortunately I was so well concealed that he could not find	49.35385513305664
16521/28840	Then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to Versa	43.829078674316406
16522/28840	But as you know a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a days journey before me who followed him on	158.9551544189453
16523/28840	The most important thing was not to kill him onlyfor I had an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesbut to kill him without being discoveredat least without being	70.64501190185547
16524/28840	I no longer belonged to myself for I had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide	65.30705261230469
16525/28840	de Villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following	109.19468688964844
16526/28840	At length I discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteu	39.145416259765625
16527/28840	Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio	33.544090270996094
16528/28840	As I had nothing more to do at Versailles I went to Auteuil and gained all the information I	28.629730224609375
16529/28840	If I wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for	90.67003631591797
16530/28840	The house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to	55.7330436706543
16531/28840	de SaintMéran lived at Marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the Baron	43.41090774536133
16532/28840	One evening as I was looking over the wall I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and I guessed that she was awaiting	57.738731384277344
16533/28840	When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very	218.66029357910156
16534/28840	As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure I saw she would ere long become a	186.25746154785156
16535/28840	A few moments after the little door was opened and a man	49.01497268676758
16536/28840	The young woman hastened to meet	40.49149703979492
16537/28840	They threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the	96.53538513183594
16538/28840	de Villefort I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden	36.6168327331543
16539/28840	20291m       And asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman   No excellency returned Bertuccio you will see that I had no time to learn	13.45408821105957
16540/28840	Three days after about seven oclock in the evening I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to Sèv	30.716995239257812
16541/28840	I concluded that he was going to Versailles and I was not	30.283355712890625
16542/28840	Three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after	79.91143798828125
16543/28840	I descended rapidly although I had not seen Villeforts face I recognized him by the beating of my	44.98638153076172
16544/28840	I crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which I had once before looked into the	43.55568313598633
16545/28840	This time I did not content myself with looking but I took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the	74.19684600830078
16546/28840	My first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the	98.71128845214844
16547/28840	Nothing then preventing my escape by this means I examined the	191.00611877441406
16548/28840	The garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and	121.38304138183594
16549/28840	In order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door	43.013858795166016
16550/28840	de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of	20.440370559692383
16551/28840	20293m       It was the end of September the wind blew	21.11564064025879
16552/28840	Two hours passed thus during which I imagined I heard moans	199.98455810546875
16553/28840	As the last stroke died away I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just	42.54487991333008
16554/28840	The door opened and the man in the mantle reapp	43.52919387817383
16555/28840	The terrible moment had come but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the	58.43117904663086
16556/28840	I drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to	121.46803283691406
16557/28840	The man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his	56.953243255615234
16558/28840	I was afraid not of a struggle but of a	102.26756286621094
16559/28840	When he was only a few paces from me I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a sp	56.983150482177734
16560/28840	I was still unable to divine for what reason	115.16145324707031
16561/28840	de Villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where I was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the	45.060028076171875
16562/28840	I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more	106.93408203125
16563/28840	Then I confess curiosity mingled with hatred I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there and I remained motionless holding my	90.62305450439453
16564/28840	Then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches	95.22208404541016
16565/28840	I know not if he heard these words I think he did not for he fell without a	48.24696731567383
16566/28840	I felt his blood gush over my face but I was intoxicated I was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning	108.50701904296875
16567/28840	In a second I had disinterred the box then that it might not be known I had done so I filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which I doublelocked carrying off the	63.155433654785156
16568/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and	41.0731315612793
16569/28840	No your excellency returned Bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by	24.071603775024414
16570/28840	And was the sum a large one   It was not	98.24227905273438
16571/28840	Ah I recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant   Yes excellency I hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the	35.289913177490234
16572/28840	In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn	154.98194885253906
16573/28840	Its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my	81.3683090209961
16574/28840	In my turn I uttered a cry but a cry of	43.62476348876953
16575/28840	God has not cursed me then I cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life I have taken	65.64693450927734
16576/28840	20295m       And what did you do with the child asked Monte Crist	10.032145500183105
16577/28840	It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to	117.69998168945312

16584/28840	Go on I am curious to know two	123.06846618652344
16585/28840	What are they your excellency   What became of this little boy for I think you told me it was a boy	42.27239227294922

16587/28840	I thought you did I must have been	87.71817779541016
16588/28840	No you were not for it was in reality a little	65.11544799804688

16590/28840	What matter you know I take but little sleep and I do not suppose you are very much inclined for it	58.79580307006836
16591/28840	Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a	108.83263397216797
16592/28840	The southern districts were illwatched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in Avignon Nîmes or Uzè	94.20610809326172
16593/28840	We profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends	47.990421295166016
16594/28840	We had thus at AiguesMortes Martigues or Bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and customhouse	68.12602233886719
16595/28840	And in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a	119.94651794433594

16600/28840	My journeys became more and more extensive and more	114.7320556640625
16601/28840	Assunta took care of all and our little fortune	301.20867919921875

16606/28840	I uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness I had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this	53.8494873046875

16611/28840	Ah Assunta cried I you are an excellent woman and Heaven will bless	133.94305419921875
16612/28840	This said Monte Cristo is less correct than your philosophyit is only	56.95245361328125

16615/28840	Unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether	192.0057830810547
16616/28840	The proverb was but too correct as regarded Benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst	98.30591583251953
16617/28840	It is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged	50.9378662109375
16618/28840	One day Benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a	74.55113983154297
16619/28840	For more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a	80.974365234375

16623/28840	I became angry he began to laugh I threatened to strike him and he made two steps	120.39358520507812

16625/28840	20299m       We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching	87.87408447265625
16626/28840	When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master and everything went	142.751220703125
16627/28840	When he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in Bastia or indeed in Corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a	121.9661865234375
16628/28840	I became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious	200.1184844970703
16629/28840	I was compelled at this period to leave Corsica on an important expedition I reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune I resolved that Benedetto should accompany	72.91561889648438
16630/28840	I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite	94.35950469970703
16631/28840	I spoke to Benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of	81.0921401977539
16632/28840	He heard me patiently and when I had finished burst out	170.1363983154297
16633/28840	The arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied	76.2923583984375

16635/28840	I gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the	105.32332611083984

16638/28840	I set off for France after having fixed upon the	80.81817626953125
16639/28840	Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 18	61.09741973876953
16640/28840	The most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the customhouse officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at Beauca	49.851558685302734

16643/28840	On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were	52.729190826416016
16644/28840	Whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed I know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabinboy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our	83.65092468261719
16645/28840	It was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhône but the care according to the boys account that they took to avoid being	83.58612823486328

16647/28840	I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from Nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beauca	17.91111946105957
16648/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo I perfectly recollect him I think he was your	30.5100154876709
16649/28840	Precisely answered Bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in	96.52639770507812
16650/28840	Of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that I intended to ask	77.21887969970703
16651/28840	What was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccios	59.16202163696289
16652/28840	Gaspard Caderousse he had married a woman from the village of Carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her	37.018550872802734
16653/28840	She was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by	215.01104736328125
16654/28840	As for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or fiveandforty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and	60.23081588745117
16655/28840	And you say interrupted Monte Cristo that this took place towards the year   1829 your excell	41.2808952331543
16656/28840	The beginning or the end   The evening of the 3	55.7652587890625
16657/28840	20303m       Ah said Monte Cristo the evening of the 3rd of June 18	13.41409683227539
16658/28840	My intention was if Caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the customhouse officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its	86.35984802246094
16659/28840	I stepped into the shed and it was fortunate I did so for at that moment Caderousse entered with a	67.94768524169922
16660/28840	I waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because I could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often	82.4936752319336
16661/28840	Then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife Hello Carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is	71.26253509521484
16662/28840	An exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble	50.09685516357422
16663/28840	What do you say asked his wife pale as	85.34066009521484
16664/28840	I say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of Paris will give us 50000 francs for	26.803903579711914
16665/28840	Only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as I have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our	52.441219329833984
16666/28840	In the meantime please to sit down monsieur and I will fetch you some refresh	36.36344528198242
16667/28840	The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a	49.172325134277344
16668/28840	Relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two recitals	52.93857192993164
16669/28840	Oh returned she it was a gift of	115.51420593261719
16670/28840	My husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named Edmond Dantè	25.902456283569336
16671/28840	This poor fellow whom Caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to	54.93178176879883
16672/28840	The same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be	105.48853302001953
16673/28840	Theres only the price we are not agreed	285.71490478515625
16674/28840	I thought we agreed for the price I	307.3585205078125
16675/28840	That is replied the jeweller I offered 40000 franc	24.89383316040039
16676/28840	Forty thousand cried La Carconte we will not part with it for that	80.7880859375
16677/28840	The abbé told us it was worth 50000 without the	55.254066467285156
16678/28840	What was the abbés name asked the indefatigable question	67.51175689697266
16679/28840	He was a foreigner   An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua I	55.11052703857422
16680/28840	Let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a	78.35411834716797
16681/28840	Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jew	30.595470428466797
16682/28840	At the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut La Carcontes eyes sparkled with cup	28.798633575439453
16683/28840	And what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said Monte Cristo did you credit it   Yes your excell	15.168673515319824
16684/28840	I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man and I thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a	55.424713134765625
16685/28840	That did more honor to your heart than to your experience	133.47506713867188
16686/28840	The jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it	72.2676773071289
16687/28840	I will give you 45000 said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone I brought just that sum with	77.26380920410156
16688/28840	Oh thats no matter replied Caderousse I will go back with you to fetch the other 5000 franc	29.7529296875
16689/28840	No returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse no it is worth no more and I am sorry I offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which I had not	52.17717742919922
16690/28840	However I will not go back on my word and I will give 45	24.8320369720459
16691/28840	At least replace the diamond in the ring said La Carconte	63.85051727294922
16692/28840	Ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the	50.00654983520508
16693/28840	No matter observed Caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase	68.83624267578125
16694/28840	Yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as I am or content himself with the same	38.224647521972656
16695/28840	It is not natural that a man like you should possess such a	58.05522155761719
16696/28840	You will have to find the Abbé Busoni and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are	46.61425018310547
16697/28840	Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each	48.70286560058594
16698/28840	No said Caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5000 franc	15.566438674926758
16699/28840	As you please my dear sir said the jeweller I had however as you see brought you the money in bright	45.22820281982422
16700/28840	And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank	32.72157287597656
16701/28840	There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his	64.57726287841797
16702/28840	What do you think of this he asked in a low	13.244857788085938
16703/28840	Let him have itlet him have it she	298.3408203125
16704/28840	If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoniin all probability we shall never see	52.489280700683594
16705/28840	Well then so I will said Caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45000 franc	39.53181838989258
16706/28840	But my wife wants a gold chain and I want a pair of silver buck	67.84819030761719
16707/28840	The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles	63.12053680419922
16708/28840	Here he said I am very straightforward in my dealingstake your	79.24224090576172
16709/28840	The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen franc	80.42747497558594
16710/28840	I hope you will not complain now said the jew	33.100990295410156
16711/28840	The abbé told me it was worth 50000 francs muttered Cader	13.67486572265625
16712/28840	Come comegive it to me What a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his	64.3841781616211
16713/28840	Here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15000 francs in gold and 30000 francs in bank	31.503705978393555
16714/28840	Wait whilst I light the lamp said La Carconte it is growing dark and there may be some	61.781402587890625
16715/28840	In fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half	99.41307830810547
16716/28840	The thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller Caderousse or La Carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of	66.4178466796875
16717/28840	I myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these banknotes it seemed to me that I was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream I felt myself riveted to the	42.96085739135742
16718/28840	Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her	110.03264617919922
16719/28840	During this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichprecursors of the stormbegan to play in at the	72.83357238769531
16720/28840	Well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right   Yes said Cader	38.79983901977539
16721/28840	Give me the pocketbook La Carconte and find a bag	134.87860107421875
16722/28840	La Carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocketbook and a	46.244197845458984
16723/28840	From the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknotes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable	61.72209930419922
16724/28840	There said Caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10000 francs will you have your supper with us I invite you with	59.42675018310547
16725/28840	Thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and I must return to Beaucairemy wife will be getting	53.4947624206543
16726/28840	He drew out his watch and exclaimed _Morbleu_ nearly nine oclockwhy I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight Goodnight my	61.00819396972656
16727/28840	If the Abbé Busoni should by any accident return think of	40.211204528808594
16728/28840	In another week you will have left Beaucaire remarked Caderousse for the fair ends in a few	51.62190628051758
16729/28840	Write to me at Paris to	196.7639617919922
16730/28840	Joannes in the Palais Royal arcade Pierre	26.92140769958496
16731/28840	I will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth	54.65884017944336
16732/28840	At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the	45.695858001708984
16733/28840	20307m       See here exclaimed Cader	14.238476753234863
16734/28840	You cannot think of going out in such weather as	109.2504653930664
16735/28840	Oh I am not afraid of thunder said the jew	33.12397766113281
16736/28840	And then there are robbers said La Carcon	41.940582275390625

16740/28840	Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning	89.40303039550781
16741/28840	It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible	61.85848617553711
16742/28840	Well then a good journey to you said Cader	29.0694580078125
16743/28840	He then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went	39.452266693115234
16744/28840	At the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly	60.02573013305664
16745/28840	Oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a	80.77287292480469
16746/28840	Yes do stay added La Carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of	32.521949768066406
16747/28840	Caderousse followed him slowly to the	110.43569946289062
16748/28840	I can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the	50.760986328125
16749/28840	Do I turn to the right or to the left hand   To the right said Cader	32.32314682006836

16754/28840	20311m       He came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocketbook and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank	40.933570861816406

16799/28840	The jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive host	101.66364288330078
16800/28840	Had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished	91.78739929199219
16801/28840	Caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened	68.57271575927734

16807/28840	The quick eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended while Caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at	54.2144660949707
16808/28840	Overhead I could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his	87.14252471923828

16816/28840	How long I had been in this unconscious state I know not when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful	67.78433227539062
16817/28840	Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the	82.1365737915039
16818/28840	I had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again I heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly	119.31571960449219
16819/28840	A cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy letharg	102.53915405273438

16824/28840	Then all became clear and manifest to me and I reproached myself with what had happened as though I myself had done the guilty	113.43962860107422
16825/28840	For this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining	119.58490753173828

16828/28840	The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at	205.73455810546875

16906/28840	There is the little door opening into the	105.46604919433594

16955/28840	I am perfectly aware of that fact answered Monte Cristo	42.712039947509766

16991/28840	As he passed them he said   They are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them	105.9561538696289

17046/28840	Is it possible that Thomson  French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers Pray tell me what you think baron for I feel uneasy I can assure you having some considerable property in their	75.26374816894531
17047/28840	Thomson  French are perfectly solvent replied Danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word _unlimited_ in financial affairs is so extremely	63.50839614868164
17048/28840	Is in fact unlimited said Monte Crist	64.57323455810547
17049/28840	Precisely what I was about to say cried Dangl	72.89496612548828
17050/28840	Now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep	229.18702697753906
17051/28840	Meaning to say rejoined Monte Cristo that however Thomson  French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their	38.99820327758789
17052/28840	Thomson  French set no bounds to their engagements while those of	267.37054443359375
17053/28840	Danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own	54.475914001464844
17054/28840	Monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been	51.183326721191406
17055/28840	It seems then reserved for me said Monte Cristo coldly to be the first to do	27.58473777770996
17056/28840	By what right sir   By right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some	109.69181823730469
17057/28840	It was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own	52.975589752197266
17058/28840	His forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impert	160.34722900390625
17059/28840	Monte Cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the	101.79641723632812
17060/28840	The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper	102.03279113769531
17061/28840	I said a million replied Danglars with the confidence of	44.678367614746094
17062/28840	But could I do with a million retorted the	67.62496948242188
17063/28840	My dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me I should never have given myself the trouble of opening an	104.97521209716797
17064/28840	A million Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocketbook or dressing	66.40872192382812
17065/28840	And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visitingcards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500000 francs each payable at sight to the	50.771080017089844
17066/28840	A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of	47.7194938659668
17067/28840	The effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apople	48.416290283203125
17068/28840	The pupils of his eyes as he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated	43.03902816772461
17069/28840	Come come said Monte Cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson 	49.8963623046875
17070/28840	I understand and foreseeing that such might be the case I took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain	80.59754943847656
17071/28840	See here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of Arstein  Eskeles of Vienna to Baron Rothschild the other drawn by Baring of London upon	68.75505828857422
17072/28840	Now sir you have but to say the word and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two	73.40908813476562
17073/28840	Nay answered Monte Cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommod	47.75226974487305
17074/28840	Then you can let me have some money can you not   Whatever you say my dear count I am at your	36.36965560913086
17075/28840	Why replied Monte Cristo since we mutually understand each otherfor such I presume is the case Danglars bowed assent	52.7792854309082
17076/28840	You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind   Oh my dear count exclaimed Danglars I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards	45.855255126953125
17077/28840	Then if I should require more continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner why of course I should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I	60.56803894042969
17078/28840	Be kind enough then to send me 500000 francs	74.60487365722656
17079/28840	I shall be at home till midday or if not I will leave a receipt with my stew	47.68450927734375
17080/28840	The money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my dear count replied Dangl	26.109764099121094
17081/28840	How would you like to have it in gold silver or notes   Half in gold and the other half in banknotes if you please said the count rising from his	66.5038833618164
17082/28840	I must confess to you count said Danglars that I have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of Europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to	36.08831787109375
17083/28840	May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it   It has been in the family a very long while returned Monte Cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the	74.49652099609375
17084/28840	The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few	91.25985717773438
17085/28840	Your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted	101.97914123535156
17086/28840	However you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere	52.65474319458008
17087/28840	And the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz dÉpin	56.27793502807617
17088/28840	With your tastes and means of gratifying them continued Danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the	109.50404357910156
17089/28840	If I mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the	136.1389923095703
17090/28840	If you will permit me I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masterswarranted as	98.02220916748047
17091/28840	I cannot endure the modern school of	135.926025390625
17092/28840	You are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become	106.56656646728516
17093/28840	Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen Bartoloni and Canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive I think but very indifferently of our French sculpt	82.85327911376953
17094/28840	You have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compat	32.82670593261719
17095/28840	But all this may come later when we shall be better known to each	69.3790512084961
17096/28840	For the present I will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the Baroness Danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the	54.59390640258789
17097/28840	Monte Cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy l	91.22374725341797
17098/28840	Is the baroness at home inquired Dangl	19.316326141357422
17099/28840	And alone   No my lord madame has	62.789669036865234
17100/28840	Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_   No indeed replied Monte Cristo with a smile I do not arrogate to myself the right of so	35.15977478027344
17101/28840	Debray inquired Danglars with an air of indulgence and goodnature that made Monte Cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic	36.64537048339844
17102/28840	Yes my lord replied the servant	78.21514129638672
17103/28840	Danglars nodded his head then turning to Monte Cristo said	13.565080642700195
17104/28840	Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the Minister of the	24.396406173706055
17105/28840	As for my wife I must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in	61.15420150756836
17106/28840	Her maiden name was De Servières and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargon	67.51166534423828
17107/28840	I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars but I have already met	17.628284454345703
17108/28840	Ah indeed said Danglars and where was that   At the house of	22.2143497467041
17109/28840	Ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you   We were together a good deal during the Carnival at	42.41188430786133
17110/28840	Let me see have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape I forget how but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from	153.56228637695312
17111/28840	Her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his	61.74635314941406
17112/28840	With your permission said Danglars bowing I will precede you to show you the	25.711074829101562
17113/28840	By all means replied Monte Cristo I follow	40.080440521240234
17114/28840	The truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by	158.48484802246094
17115/28840	Danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the	46.93822479248047
17116/28840	The decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debr	17.77524185180664
17117/28840	Lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to Madame Dangl	37.023284912109375
17118/28840	Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by Debr	69.12655639648438
17119/28840	This posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of	157.95953369140625
17120/28840	A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on	335.5610656738281
17121/28840	Danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with Danglars a free and easy	75.6509780883789
17122/28840	Baroness said Danglars give me leave to present to you the Count of Monte Cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at	24.61053466796875
17123/28840	I need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in Paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in Paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of	72.59817504882812
17124/28840	That means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which I trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertain	177.00677490234375
17125/28840	And when did you arrive here inquired	206.4137420654297
17126/28840	Coming as usual I presume from the extreme end of the globe Pardon meat least such I have heard is your	200.15017700195312
17127/28840	This time I have merely come from Cad	49.75252151489258
17128/28840	You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first	75.06967163085938
17129/28840	Paris is a horrible place in	371.8424987792969
17130/28840	Balls parties and _fêtes_ are over the Italian opera is in London the French opera everywhere except in	124.36866760253906
17131/28840	As for the Théatre Français you know of course that it is	48.12998580932617
17132/28840	The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the ChampdeMars and S	101.51400756835938
17133/28840	Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count   I shall do whatever they do at Paris madame if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of	71.27317810058594
17134/28840	Are you fond of horses count   I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East madame and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two thingsthe fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their	47.644622802734375
17135/28840	Nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies	83.80706787109375
17136/28840	You see madame how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings	193.07638549804688
17137/28840	At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undert	34.07700729370117
17138/28840	Madame Danglars turned very pale then exclaimed   I cannot believe it the thing is	41.309837341308594
17139/28840	I assure you madame replied the woman it is as I have	20.291425704956055
17140/28840	Turning impatiently towards her husband Madame Danglars demanded Is this true   Is what true madame inquired Danglars visibly	46.785484313964844
17141/28840	But what does she tell you   That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his	47.403900146484375
17142/28840	I desire to know what is the meaning of this   Be kind enough madame to listen to me said Dangl	14.969034194946289
17143/28840	Oh yes I will listen monsieur for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will	36.3094367980957
17144/28840	These two gentlemen shall decide between us but first I will state the case to	251.86181640625
17145/28840	Gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars are two that belong exclusively to mea pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in	64.0845947265625
17146/28840	Debray I need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well	74.786376953125
17147/28840	Well I had promised Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gonepositively	47.003021240234375
17148/28840	Danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry franc	47.93739318847656
17149/28840	Oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators   Madame replied Danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your	43.56122970581055
17150/28840	Nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in	41.58364486694336
17151/28840	But perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses   My dear love pray do not say any more about them and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and	85.20171356201172
17152/28840	The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards Monte Cristo and saidUpon my word count I am quite sorry not to have met you	46.53561019897461
17153/28840	You are setting up an establishment of course   Why yes replied the	39.349430084228516
17154/28840	I should have liked to have made you the offer of these	59.71167755126953
17155/28840	I have almost given them away as it is but as I before said I was anxious to get rid of them upon any	64.76849365234375
17156/28840	They were only fit for a young	150.3156280517578
17157/28840	I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said Monte Cristo but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and I do not think they were	53.50254440307617
17158/28840	Debray you are a connoisseur I believe let me have your opinion upon	35.43024826049805
17159/28840	As Debray walked towards the window Danglars approached his	28.77735137939453
17160/28840	I could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for	66.25193786621094
17161/28840	Some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is I have gained 16000 francs by the sale of	79.23506164550781
17162/28840	Come dont look so angry and you shall have 4000 francs of the money to do what you like with and Eugénie shall have	69.42998504638672
17163/28840	There what do you think now of the affair Wasnt I right to part with the horses   Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering	36.817569732666016
17164/28840	I cannot be mistaken there are your horses The very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage   My dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the	39.881195068359375
17165/28840	How very singular cried Monte Cristo with wellfeigned aston	30.630722045898438
17166/28840	I cannot believe it murmured the	39.795372009277344
17167/28840	Madame Danglars whispered a few words in the ear of Debray who approached Monte Cristo saying The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the	31.88077735900879
17168/28840	I scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost mewell somewhere about 30000 franc	43.11951446533203
17169/28840	Debray conveyed the counts reply to the baron	28.827810287475586
17170/28840	Poor Danglars looked so crestfallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards	50.27590560913086
17171/28840	See said the count how very ungrateful women	30.519662857055664
17172/28840	Your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on	48.062068939208984
17173/28840	But so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is	137.4178924560547
17174/28840	Therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but	75.27562713623047
17175/28840	Danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of Olympic Jove predicted a	42.90874481201172
17176/28840	20347m       Excellent murmured Monte Cristo to himself as he came	13.444660186767578
17177/28840	All has gone according to my	225.82733154296875
17178/28840	The domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my	123.65292358398438
17179/28840	But he went on with his peculiar smile I am here in Paris and have plenty of time before meby and by will do for	72.92587280273438
17180/28840	With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned	100.3581771850586
17181/28840	The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the counts orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large	73.08729553222656
17182/28840	To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the	50.45113754272461
17183/28840	During the evening Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil accompanied by	32.75352478027344
17184/28840	The following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the	61.26426315307617
17185/28840	Ali observed his master as the Nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not   Ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the	50.517940521240234
17186/28840	With your lasso you could stop an ox   Again Ali repeated his affirmative	224.7108612060547

17192/28840	Ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching	42.01723098754883
17193/28840	Still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his	57.16682815551758
17194/28840	Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious	97.11383819580078
17195/28840	In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each others	43.24806594848633
17196/28840	Terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a	48.991432189941406

17198/28840	Gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his	82.87828826904297

17229/28840	This lady said the Count speaking to Ali in the Arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too	88.22949981689453
17230/28840	Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the	54.46510696411133

17238/28840	I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but I have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his	97.44656372070312
17239/28840	The count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to	101.74375915527344

17242/28840	You will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by	69.66739654541016
17243/28840	The count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in	95.26932525634766

17251/28840	That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of	68.26734924316406
17252/28840	Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic	69.13526916503906

17326/28840	And that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothersfor you have said so observed Villefort in a tone that faltered somewhatyou alone are	94.16349029541016
17327/28840	No not perfect was the counts reply only impenetrable thats	126.96066284179688
17328/28840	But let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my seconds	70.32974243164062
17329/28840	No noby no means said Villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his	73.39484405517578
17330/28840	No by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to	236.5716094970703
17331/28840	30029m       Above us all sir was Monte Cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shudd	27.310989379882812
17332/28840	I have my pride for menserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under	98.69015502929688
17333/28840	But I lay aside that pride before God who has taken me from nothing to make me what I	60.7003173828125
17334/28840	Then count I admire you said Villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsie	55.195552825927734
17335/28840	Yes and I say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predomin	64.10784912109375
17336/28840	I wish to be Providence myself for I feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and	56.993690490722656
17337/28840	You mistake he said Providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of God is as invisible as the	96.79308319091797
17338/28840	You have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden	163.62179565429688
17339/28840	All I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that	50.67222213745117
17340/28840	I may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added Monte Crist	60.007015228271484
17341/28840	If the thing were to do again I would again do	121.88502502441406
17342/28840	Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amaz	13.780325889587402
17343/28840	Count he inquired have you any relations   No sir I am alone in the	25.856704711914062
17344/28840	Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your	491.0627136230469
17345/28840	You say you fear nothing but death   I did not say that I feared it I only said that death alone could check the execution of my	64.70255279541016
17346/28840	And old age   My end will be achieved before I grow	171.21334838867188
17347/28840	And madness   I have been nearly mad and you know the axiom_non bis in idem	48.306095123291016
17348/28840	It is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full	148.1398162841797
17349/28840	30031m       Sir continued Villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and	33.68938064575195
17350/28840	For instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an	108.60779571533203
17351/28840	Come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and I will show you my father	74.81380462646484
17352/28840	Well sir the rupture of a bloodvessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a	77.40213012695312
17353/28840	Noirtier who on the previous night was the old Jacobin the old senator the old Carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the dagger	48.20681381225586
17354/28840	Noirtier for whom France was a vast chessboard from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmated	93.49211120605469
17355/28840	Noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning _poor	66.4826431274414
17356/28840	Alas sir said Monte Cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my	129.41436767578125
17357/28840	I am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like Providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my	207.70240783691406
17358/28840	A hundred writers since Socrates Seneca	132.49288940429688
17359/28840	Augustine and Gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet I can well understand that a fathers sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a	111.47920989990234
17360/28840	I will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your	46.345787048339844
17361/28840	It would have been so unquestionably had not God given me so large a	97.22429656982422
17362/28840	And what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired Monte Crist	57.18634796142578
17363/28840	My deduction is replied Villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of	115.56395721435547
17364/28840	That God desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him	136.3297119140625
17365/28840	Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard	41.04911804199219
17366/28840	Besides you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Ville	28.031583786010742
17367/28840	The count bowed and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of	52.07077407836914
17368/28840	When he had gone Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh and said   Enough of this poison let me now seek the	90.33231353759766
17369/28840	Then sounding his bell he said to Ali who entered   I am going to madames chamberhave the carriage ready at one o	73.19792938232422
17370/28840	Haydée   It will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo residing in the Rue Meslay were no other than Maximilian Julie and	32.30887222290039
17371/28840	The young Greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the	141.71652221679688
17372/28840	Haydée had three French maids and one who was a	202.69390869140625
17373/28840	The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her	134.36903381347656
17374/28840	This was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rosecolored	26.588693618774414
17375/28840	Her attitude though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would in a European have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after	179.11692810058594
17376/28840	The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian bell	71.07365417480469
17377/28840	And to complete the whole Haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charmsshe had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty	67.92633819580078
17378/28840	Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his	72.98800659179688
17379/28840	Why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young	119.08052825927734
17380/28840	Have I by any means displeased you Oh if so punish me as you will but do notdo not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and	116.92340087890625
17381/28840	Haydée replied the count you know that you are now in France and are	43.27803039550781

17384/28840	I dont wish to see anybody but	40.015445709228516
17385/28840	And should you see one whom you could prefer I would not be so unjust   I have never seen anyone I preferred to you and I have never loved anyone but you and my	47.01302719116211
17386/28840	My poor child replied Monte Cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to	43.10428237915039
17387/28840	I dont want anybody else to talk to	56.73674392700195

17389/28840	Do you remember your father Haydée   The young Greek	33.1160888671875
17390/28840	He is here and here said she touching her eyes and her	72.89326477050781
17391/28840	And where am I inquired Monte Cristo laugh	100.91309356689453
17392/28840	You cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her	73.55361938476562
17393/28840	You now understand Haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your	88.89049530029297
17394/28840	Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to	94.51824188232422
17395/28840	A carriage waits your orders and Ali and Myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to	109.42658233642578
17396/28840	There is but one favor I would entreat of	63.996337890625
17397/28840	Guard carefully the secret of your	197.7159423828125
17398/28840	Make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or illfated	137.0209197998047
17399/28840	I have already told you my lord that I shall see no	14.939828872680664
17400/28840	It is possible Haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the East may not be practicable in	90.62641906738281
17401/28840	Endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome Florence Milan and Madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the	77.06070709228516
17402/28840	My lord replied Haydée I never will leave you for I am sure I could not exist without	43.17086410522461

17414/28840	The carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid	102.89096069335938

17427/28840	Cocles opened the gate and Baptistin springing from the box inquired whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel would see his excellency the Count of Monte Crist	26.17609405517578
17428/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo cried Morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage I should think we would see	30.606456756591797
17429/28840	Ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your	170.6349334716797
17430/28840	And the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that Monte Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with	43.07969284057617

17450/28840	Fiveandtwenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied Monte Cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to Maximilians heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with	37.64379119873047

17470/28840	He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden he returned to the	31.141382217407227
17471/28840	A large vase of Japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the	62.32563400268555
17472/28840	Julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his	148.79388427734375
17473/28840	The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet	94.54830932617188
17474/28840	Everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and rep	88.99513244628906
17475/28840	The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been	42.413604736328125
17476/28840	We are very happy monsieur replied Julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than	67.99028015136719
17477/28840	The counts features displayed an expression of the most intense	144.20993041992188
17478/28840	Oh all this is a family history as ChâteauRenaud told you the other day observed Maximil	28.62383460998535
17479/28840	This humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrow	74.26580047607422
17480/28840	And God has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said Monte Cristo inquiring	86.40792083740234
17481/28840	Yes count returned Julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his	89.23635864257812
17482/28840	The counts cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his	43.36095428466797
17483/28840	Monte Cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow	38.91594696044922
17484/28840	Our magnificence makes you smile count said Maximilian who had followed him with his	42.42500305175781
17485/28840	No no returned Monte Cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet	50.747013092041016
17486/28840	I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the	87.19556427001953
17487/28840	Count replied Maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family	71.49022674560547
17488/28840	The stone seems very brilliant answered the	504.8309326171875
17489/28840	Oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100000 francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just	68.55634307861328
17490/28840	This I do not comprehend and yet I may not ask for an explanation madame replied Monte Cristo b	25.7762451171875

17492/28840	Indiscretionoh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this	141.27716064453125
17493/28840	If we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to	108.46392822265625
17494/28840	Oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his	105.93109893798828
17495/28840	Ah really said Monte Cristo in a halfstifled	32.7846794128418
17496/28840	Monte Cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of	24.711376190185547
17497/28840	It was the letter written as our readers know to Julie and signed Sinbad the	84.9648666381836
17498/28840	Unknown you say is the man who rendered you this serviceunknown to you   Yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued Maximil	43.190494537353516
17499/28840	We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehendwe have been guided by an invisible handa hand as powerful as that of an enchan	78.48992919921875
17500/28840	Oh cried Julie I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as I now kiss the purse which he has	97.20755767822266
17501/28840	He felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address	48.96113204956055
17502/28840	An Englishman said Monte Cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at	60.36439514160156
17503/28840	An Englishman you say   Yes replied Maximilian an Englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French at	24.14253044128418
17504/28840	It was this that made me start when you said the other day at	163.22645568847656
17505/28840	That happened as I told you in 18	44.96983337402344
17506/28840	For Gods sake tell me did you know this Englishman   But you tell me also that the house of Thomson  French have constantly denied having rendered you this service  	37.84602355957031
17507/28840	Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation   Everything is possible in this affair even a	87.21369934082031
17508/28840	What was his name asked Monte Crist	26.28167724609375
17509/28840	He gave no other name answered Julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letterSinbad the	32.02580642700195
17510/28840	Which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious	155.8286590576172
17511/28840	No returned Monte Cristo I only	35.52070617675781
17512/28840	I knew a Lord Wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this	96.29883575439453
17513/28840	Without revealing himself   He was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of	84.90727996826172
17514/28840	And do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired	40.60012435913086
17515/28840	In the name of Heaven said Maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it	23.565706253051758
17516/28840	Alas cried Monte Cristo striving to repress his emotion if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor I fear you will never see him	37.4860725402832
17517/28840	I parted from him two years ago at Palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that I fear he will never	44.98772048950195
17518/28840	Oh monsieur this is cruel of you said Julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with	63.077152252197266
17519/28840	But continued she Lord Wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not   Oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek	68.34675598144531
17520/28840	He was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in	43.57246017456055
17521/28840	And he told you nothing   Not a	59.729103088378906
17522/28840	Nothing that would lead you to suppose  	48.33015060424805
17523/28840	And yet you spoke of him at	86.2020263671875
17524/28840	Ah in such a case one supposes   Sister sister said Maximilian coming to the counts aid monsieur is quite	45.74143981933594
17525/28840	Recollect what our excellent father so often told us It was no Englishman that thus saved	139.97982788085938
17526/28840	What did your father tell you	88.46853637695312
17527/28840	My father thought that this action had been miraculously performedhe believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save	106.31310272216797
17528/28840	Oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although I did not myself believe it I would not for the world have destroyed my fathers	72.8690414428711
17529/28840	This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man said	20.812482833862305
17530/28840	Yes answered Maximilian but I feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes	37.90143585205078
17531/28840	His voice went to my heart observed Julie and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it	46.73267364501953
17532/28840	For the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitcheng	73.32910919189453

17535/28840	At that instant the little sidegate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man	76.7858657836914
17536/28840	He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian	122.43141174316406
17537/28840	After casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the	50.94707107543945
17538/28840	At the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty	78.72611236572266
17539/28840	But the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue s	90.69109344482422
17540/28840	So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that at first I did not recognize	59.70763397216797
17541/28840	Dearest Valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly I adore	70.70806884765625
17542/28840	You asked me the cause of my being late and why I come	115.21868133544922
17543/28840	I will candidly explain the reason of both and I trust to your goodness to pardon	64.5174331665039
17544/28840	I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a	169.3209228515625

17548/28840	Simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I stand was to let I made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of luc	78.9921875
17549/28840	Think of that Valentine There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from	104.50668334960938
17550/28840	Only imagine what happiness that would afford	245.81521606445312

17555/28840	A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart   Alas no Maximilian this must not be for many	75.52886199951172
17556/28840	We should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prud	188.76527404785156
17557/28840	How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear Valentine Have I not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas And you have I am sure the fullest confidence in my	142.0887451171875

17561/28840	But what cared I for delays or difficulties Valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me If you will only repeat that avowal now and then I can endure	89.32384490966797
17562/28840	I will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and	49.270782470703125

17581/28840	God knows I would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate	84.61071014404297
17582/28840	Poor Valentine   I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the restraint in which I am held lest I fall utterly	94.61956787109375

17584/28840	But why Valentine do you persist in anticipating the worstwhy picture so gloomy a future   Because I judge it from the	126.935791015625

17592/28840	Now it is you who are unjust Maximilian cried Valentine but there is one thing I wish to	39.63015365600586
17593/28840	And what is that inquired the young man perceiving that Valentine	51.91227340698242

17598/28840	Always tell me everything said Maximilian with a	23.705907821655273
17599/28840	Though it certainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized	370.92236328125

17764/28840	Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to	40.38806915283203
17765/28840	What then is it   A skilful preparation of my friends the worthy Abbé Adelmonte who taught me the use of	16.95547866821289
17766/28840	Oh observed Madame de Villefort it must be an admirable antispasmod	14.239849090576172
17767/28840	Perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and I frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of	59.31365203857422
17768/28840	Most assuredly responded Madame de Villefort in the same	15.632710456848145

17771/28840	Monte Cristo opened the tortoiseshell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their	49.2044563293457
17772/28840	They are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutitiona function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplishI prefer my own	102.87673950195312
17773/28840	Undoubtedly and so should I prefer it after the effects I have seen produced but of course it is a secret and I am not so indiscreet as to ask it of	67.6448745727539
17774/28840	But I said Monte Cristo rising as he spokeI am gallant enough to offer it	41.16682815551758

17779/28840	The clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of Madame de Villefort who came to dine with	22.93370246887207
17780/28840	A thousand thanks madame replied Monte Cristo but I have an engagement which I cannot	24.949512481689453

17787/28840	As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost	64.79524230957031

17793/28840	ChâteauRenaud rented a stall beside his own while Beauchamp as a journalist had unlimited range all over the	51.17634963989258

17796/28840	One must take the world as one finds	193.93939208984375
17797/28840	Surely said Albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the Countess	57.91752624511719
17798/28840	And who is the Countess G inquired ChâteauRen	19.17401695251465
17799/28840	What a question Now do you know baron I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the Countess G	48.131893157958984
17800/28840	Ah to be sure replied ChâteauRenaud the lovely Venetian is it not   Her	15.601151466369629
17801/28840	At this moment the countess perceived Albert and returned his salutation with a	38.69161605834961
17802/28840	You know her it seems said ChâteauRen	22.478748321533203
17803/28840	Franz introduced me to her at Rome replied	141.48912048339844
17804/28840	Well then will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome   With	64.23590850830078
17805/28840	There was a cry of Shut up from the	70.24685668945312
17806/28840	This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their	47.11231994628906
17807/28840	The countess was present at the races in the ChampdeMars said ChâteauRen	17.76951026916504
17808/28840	Bless me I quite forgot the	1478.578857421875
17809/28840	Did you bet   Oh merely a paltry fifty lou	53.075984954833984
17810/28840	And who was the winner   Naut	59.94469451904297
17811/28840	But there were three races were there not   Yes there was the prize given by the Jockey Cluba gold cup you knowand a very singular circumstance occurred about that	82.13645935058594
17812/28840	What was it   Oh shut up again interposed some of the	67.1539535522461
17813/28840	Why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the	75.92034912109375
17814/28840	Is that possible   True as	157.35450744628906
17815/28840	The fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa or that of a jockey styled Job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting	90.3897933959961
17816/28840	They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riders pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole	136.3749542236328
17817/28840	And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged  	90.61328887939453
17818/28840	You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa   Exactly that was the	42.67451095581055
17819/28840	Then answered Albert I am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse	79.28207397460938
17820/28840	Shut up there cried the pit in	478.5757751464844
17821/28840	And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to	47.15404510498047
17822/28840	At this moment the door of the ministers box opened and Madame Danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by Lucien Debray who assiduously conducted them to their	25.269155502319336
17823/28840	Now barring all that I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl   Handsome certainly replied Albert but not to my taste which I confess inclines to something softer gentler and more	95.58014678955078
17824/28840	And indeed it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the justness of Morcerfs	36.59836959838867
17825/28840	Her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale	160.9718017578125
17826/28840	The rest of Mademoiselle Eugénies person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of Diana as ChâteauRenaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and res	52.388736724853516
17827/28840	As regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a	91.59545135498047
17828/28840	It was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and	65.97989654541016
17829/28840	Still though not actually received at the Hôtel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a govern	95.9033203125
17830/28840	Morcerf and ChâteauRenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this	31.406909942626953
17831/28840	For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to	37.008853912353516
17832/28840	Be assured replied Albert that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris and had known your address I should have paid my respects to you before	48.756507873535156
17833/28840	Allow me to introduce my friend Baron de ChâteauRenaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the ChampdeMars	43.620487213134766
17834/28840	So you were at the races baron inquired the countess	54.7958984375
17835/28840	Well then pursued Madame G with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes   I am sorry to say I cannot replied the baron and I was just asking the same question of	52.927818298339844
17836/28840	Are you very anxious to know countess asked	75.47018432617188
17837/28840	Inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsFrom Lord Ruthven to Countess	51.037113189697266
17838/28840	Precisely I was sure of it said Morcer	115.63108825683594
17839/28840	Sure of what   That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven	47.77751922607422
17840/28840	de ChâteauRenaud has also the honor of his	18.005001068115234
17841/28840	And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner   To be sure I remember it all	63.8435173034668
17842/28840	You see its evident where the count got the	358.6214904785156
17843/28840	I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him   I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have	66.70941162109375
17844/28840	Besides his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven   Oh but that is dreadful Why the man must owe me a fearful gr	94.7207260131836
17845/28840	Does his action appear like that of an enemy   No certainly	96.23810577392578
17846/28840	Well then   And so he is in Paris  	19.552642822265625
17847/28840	And what effect does he produce   Why said Albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of England took place followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Marss diamonds and so people talked of something	69.71744537353516
17848/28840	My good fellow said ChâteauRenaud the count is your friend and you treat him	32.156463623046875
17849/28840	Do not believe what Albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as	63.834293365478516
17850/28840	Perhaps you are right said Morcerf meanwhile who is in the Russian ambassadors box   Which box do you mean asked the count	34.7645149230957
17851/28840	The one between the pillars on the first tierit seems to have been fitted up entirely af	72.22792053222656
17852/28840	Did you observe anyone during the first act asked ChâteauRen	24.58875846862793
17853/28840	No replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize   I am sure of	46.907169342041016
17854/28840	And who afterwards sent the cup to me   Und	133.4606170654297
17855/28840	But I dont know him said the countess I have a great mind to return	28.645160675048828
17856/28840	Do no such thing I beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic	71.5854721069336
17857/28840	It is his way and you must take him as you find	50.81428909301758
17858/28840	At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second	76.14730834960938
17859/28840	Albert rose to return to his	96.36268615722656
17860/28840	Shall I see you again asked the count	30.464326858520508
17861/28840	The young men bowed and quitted the	47.89984130859375
17862/28840	Upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian	89.09193420410156
17863/28840	A man of from thirtyfive to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern	118.37020874023438
17864/28840	The lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon	123.25346374511719
17865/28840	Hullo said Albert it is Monte Cristo and his Greek   The strangers were indeed no other than the count and Hayd	57.16691207885742
17866/28840	In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent	52.71488571166992
17867/28840	The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperintimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary	157.35232543945312
17868/28840	At the close of the act he therefore went to the baron	46.38412094116211
17869/28840	Having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to Debr	31.325456619262695
17870/28840	By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while Eugénie received him with her accustomed cold	55.43092346191406
17871/28840	My dear fellow said Debray you have come in the nick of	37.563758850097656
17872/28840	There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is	82.46122741699219
17873/28840	However I have turned the business over to Morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part I care nothing about the count or his mysterious do	75.18709564208984
17874/28840	30093m       I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5000 francs	27.755033493041992
17875/28840	He seems to have a mania for diamonds said Morcerf smiling and I verily believe that like Potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as Tom Thumb did his flint	122.68082427978516
17876/28840	Perhaps he has discovered some mine said Madame Dangl	27.04070281982422
17877/28840	I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the barons banking establishment   I was not aware of it replied Albert but I can readily believe	24.34868621826172
17878/28840	And further that he stated to	256.8994140625
17879/28840	Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris during which time he proposed to spend six	55.70984649658203
17880/28840	He must be the Shah of Persia travelling _incog	55.70365524291992
17881/28840	Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman	124.17951965332031
17882/28840	I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded Lucien raising his lorgnette to his	70.85228729248047
17883/28840	A most lovely creature upon my soul was his	204.39901733398438
17884/28840	So I should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as wellinformed as	71.1353988647461
17885/28840	Then your count entertains visitors does he asked Madame Dangl	48.35481643676758
17886/28840	Indeed he does and in a most lavish manner I can assure	46.41374588012695
17887/28840	Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in	59.62563705444336
17888/28840	What said Debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house   Why not my husband could accompany	31.707355499267578
17889/28840	But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor   You have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful	50.14637756347656
17890/28840	No no exclaimed Debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his	93.9145278930664
17891/28840	Do you not recollect Morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast   Well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a	64.41267395019531
17892/28840	If you like but tell me my dear Lucien what it is that constitutes a	42.547325134277344
17893/28840	Why diamondsand she is covered with	280.64837646484375
17894/28840	To me she seems overloaded observed Eugénie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and	79.29157257080078
17895/28840	See how the artist peeps out exclaimed Madame Dangl	62.667930603027344
17896/28840	My poor Eugénie you must conceal your passion for the fine	70.27238464355469
17897/28840	I admire all that is beautiful returned the young	68.98539733886719
17898/28840	What do you think of the count inquired Debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good	39.65946960449219
17899/28840	The count repeated Eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully	60.870338439941406
17900/28840	I quite agree with you said Morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find	36.81156539916992
17901/28840	The Countess G insists upon it that he is a	39.35817337036133
17902/28840	Then the Countess G has returned to Paris has she inquired the baron	54.54827880859375
17903/28840	Is that she mamma asked Eugénie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair   Yes said Madame Danglars that is	38.9634895324707

17905/28840	Well then you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to	36.93701934814453
17906/28840	What for Why to converse with him of	86.82025909423828
17907/28840	Have you really no desire to meet him   None whatever replied Eugé	34.26109313964844
17908/28840	He will very probably come of his own accord said Morcer	83.85440063476562
17909/28840	There do you see madame he recognizes you and	71.27735900878906
17910/28840	The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful	55.17728805541992
17911/28840	Well said Morcerf I may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your	109.73539733886719
17912/28840	Adieu I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to	62.24663162231445
17913/28840	Go straight to his box that will be the simplest	159.1670684814453
17914/28840	Presented to whom   To the beautiful	58.23249816894531
17915/28840	You say she is only a slave   While you assert that she is a queen or at least a	53.228023529052734
17916/28840	No I hope that when he sees me leave you he will come	96.21778106689453
17917/28840	I am going said Albert as he made his parting	65.34941864013672
17918/28840	Just as he was passing the counts box the door opened and Monte Cristo came	31.922290802001953
17919/28840	After giving some directions to Ali who stood in the lobby the count took Alberts	48.0653076171875
17920/28840	Carefully closing the box door Ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nub	113.0750961303711
17921/28840	Upon my word said Monte Cristo Paris is a strange city and the Parisians a very singular	53.47583770751953
17922/28840	See that cluster of persons collected around poor Ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever be	136.6211700439453
17923/28840	Now I can promise you that a Frenchman might show himself in public either in Tunis Constantinople Bagdad or Cairo without being treated in that	80.3462142944336
17924/28840	That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of	145.24510192871094
17925/28840	However as far as Ali is concerned I can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in	90.13275909423828
17926/28840	Why if you sought concealment did you call your horse Vampa   That was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera I have been looking for him but without	53.642093658447266
17927/28840	In what part of the house   In the baronesss box I	23.951171875
17928/28840	That charming young woman with her is her daughter  	76.67131042480469
17929/28840	We will discuss that subject at length some future time said	120.90231323242188
17930/28840	But what do you think of the music   What music   Why the music you have been listening	29.564899444580078
17931/28840	Oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late Diogen	52.44737243652344
17932/28840	The conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for   No thank	247.53060913085938
17933/28840	To sleep after the manner I speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation   I knowthe famous hashish   Precise	68.02364349365234
17934/28840	So my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with	53.21241760253906
17935/28840	I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said Morcer	72.7057113647461
17936/28840	Do you mean at Rome   I	28.419702529907227
17937/28840	Ah then I suppose you heard Haydées guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native	141.9646759033203
17938/28840	Morcerf did not pursue the subject and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent rever	45.282161712646484
17939/28840	The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the	74.71587371826172
17940/28840	You will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his	51.42754364013672
17941/28840	What Are you going   Pray say everything that is kind to Countess G on the part of her friend the	48.92752456665039
17942/28840	And what message shall I convey to the baroness   That with her permission I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the	55.451072692871094
17943/28840	The third act had begun and during its progress the Count of Morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of Madame Dangl	32.402442932128906
17944/28840	The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated	46.214149475097656
17945/28840	The quick eye of Monte Cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his	92.70984649658203
17946/28840	Haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or	125.80457305908203
17947/28840	30099m       The third act passed off as	21.77114486694336
17948/28840	After which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and	99.02729797363281
17949/28840	The count left his box and a moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and	51.90959548950195
17950/28840	You are welcome count she exclaimed as he	106.22382354736328
17951/28840	I have been most anxious to see you that I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill	72.3214111328125
17952/28840	Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your	224.9498291015625
17953/28840	Believe me madame I had entirely forgotten	102.67390441894531
17954/28840	But it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend Madame de Villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to	38.74556350708008
17955/28840	30101m       This time at least I do not deserve your	19.20661163330078
17956/28840	It was Ali my Nubian slave who rendered this service to Madame de Ville	48.17997741699219
17957/28840	May I beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter   Oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied Madame Danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but	32.253318786621094
17958/28840	Eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the Count of Monte Crist	16.70940399169922
17959/28840	The count bowed while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head	22.843000411987305
17960/28840	You have a charming young person with you tonight count said Eugé	65.03215789794922
17961/28840	Is she your daughter   No mademoiselle said Monte Cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the	29.969318389892578
17962/28840	She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my	340.5628967285156
17963/28840	And what is her name   Haydée replied Monte Crist	14.580216407775879
17964/28840	A Greek murmured the Count of Morcer	14.576574325561523
17965/28840	There said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as Haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to Morcerfs	45.635650634765625
17966/28840	It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Med	50.76144790649414
17967/28840	She bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her	62.43822479248047
17968/28840	The sound was heard by the people about Ali who instantly opened the box	89.57998657226562
17969/28840	Why count exclaimed Eugénie what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly	85.79952239990234
17970/28840	But do not be alarmed on her	84.4601058959961
17971/28840	Haydées nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersnay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her	137.74295043945312
17972/28840	However continued Monte Cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket I have an infallible	29.30493927001953
17973/28840	So saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count and left Madame Danglars	23.91046905517578
17974/28840	Upon his return to Haydée he found her still very	52.106163024902344
17975/28840	As soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy	98.50938415527344
17976/28840	Who was it you were talking with over there she	269.54364013671875
17977/28840	With the Count of Morcerf answered Monte Crist	11.681532859802246
17978/28840	He tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to	65.92910766601562
17979/28840	You shall relate them to me my	74.28977966308594
17980/28840	They are no doubt both curious and	1018.3170776367188
17981/28840	I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful	85.61774444580078
17982/28840	So saying Haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth	42.67634963989258
17983/28840	Do you observe said the Countess G to Albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of _Robert le Diable_ and when the fourth begins takes his	71.96715545654297
17984/28840	He came to renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed Baronne Danglars _née_ Hermine de Servie	53.01099395751953
17985/28840	Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to	95.55448913574219
17986/28840	He was convinced that Luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chaussée dAnt	34.29741287231445
17987/28840	But the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between Luciens visit and the curiosity of the baron	33.4489860534668
17988/28840	You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars the count inquired of Albert de Morcer	24.180715560913086
17989/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo I did not expect that the affair would be so promptly	32.3287353515625
17990/28840	Oh things take their course without our	250.16697692871094
17991/28840	While we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed	128.0662384033203
17992/28840	Danglars served together in Spain my father in the army and	47.02009201049805
17993/28840	It was there that my father ruined by the revolution and	134.7520751953125
17994/28840	Danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different	37.389400482177734
17995/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo I think	13.824309349060059
17996/28840	Very pretty or rather very beautiful replied Albert but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate I am an ungrateful	80.32828521728516
17997/28840	You speak as if you were already her	83.21302795410156
17998/28840	Ah returned Albert in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was	33.24772644042969
17999/28840	Really said Monte Cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this	28.44072723388672
18000/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me replied Morcerf and that frightens	12.902769088745117
18001/28840	Bah exclaimed Monte Cristo thats a fine reason to	53.808589935302734
18002/28840	Are you not rich yourself   My fathers income is about 50000 francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when I	34.8170280456543
18003/28840	That perhaps might not be considered a large sum in Paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in	59.878475189208984
18004/28840	As for me I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble	34.75525665283203
18005/28840	Albert shook his head and looked	74.5830307006836
18006/28840	There is still something else said	99.71749877929688
18007/28840	I confess observed Monte Cristo that I have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and	41.92225646972656
18008/28840	Oh said Morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my	51.11763381958008
18009/28840	Whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the	179.08387756347656
18010/28840	It is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed	148.1395263671875
18011/28840	I cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Dangl	49.30091094970703
18012/28840	I do not know if that is her reason said Albert but one thing I do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite	46.220584869384766
18013/28840	There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition   Real interrupted the count	57.6835823059082
18014/28840	Oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two	566.3587646484375
18015/28840	I am not yet twentyone and Eugénie is only seventeen but the two months expire next	51.3368034362793
18016/28840	My dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is	129.43109130859375
18017/28840	Marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the	144.86204528808594
18018/28840	Yes replied Morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive	78.2378921508789
18019/28840	Then do not marry her said the	51.5170783996582
18020/28840	Monte Cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last	142.9788818359375
18021/28840	I am doing a little sum in	91.45588684082031
18022/28840	9     When they tell me such things I only shrug my shoulders and say	47.47751235961914
18023/28840	But you were speaking of Haitians said Monte Crist	26.266613006591797
18024/28840	Ah Haitiansthat is quite another thing Haitians are the _écarté_ of French stockjob	60.07392120361328
18025/28840	Danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 franc	39.58052062988281
18026/28840	Had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25	67.7281723022461
18027/28840	And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked Monte Crist	104.34788513183594
18028/28840	I am profoundly ignorant of all these stockjobbing intrig	29.602811813354492
18029/28840	Because said Albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between	151.3528289794922
18030/28840	Ah said the count I see that	32.55970764160156
18031/28840	Danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300000 francs in a day he must be enormously	34.44880294799805
18032/28840	It is not he who plays exclaimed Lucien it is Madame Danglars she is indeed	42.31205749511719
18033/28840	But you who are a reasonable being Lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountainhead surely you ought to prevent it said Morcerf with a	35.57269287109375
18034/28840	How can I if her husband fails in controlling her asked Lucien you know the character of the baronessno one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she ple	78.6876449584961
18035/28840	Ah if I were in your place said	46.198299407958984
18036/28840	Well   I would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future sonin	51.21754455566406
18037/28840	How would you set about it   Ah that would be easy enoughI would give her a	61.17143630981445
18038/28840	Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your	125.4297866821289
18039/28840	Cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prud	40.9251708984375
18040/28840	It is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheardof piece of intelligencesome telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that Henri	100.51731872558594
18041/28840	We can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the PontNe	47.65866470336914
18042/28840	Monte Cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the	109.35272979736328
18043/28840	This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at	160.50755310058594
18044/28840	The count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered Willingly count I	65.49738311767578
18045/28840	Do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of	51.51534652709961
18046/28840	Debray   My dear count said Morcerf I beg of you not to apply that title so	23.163541793823242
18047/28840	Now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage   So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not I think visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole	58.056941986083984
18048/28840	Then said the count I am emboldened to speak openly to	41.07898712158203
18049/28840	de Villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render	38.952232360839844
18050/28840	I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and rout	97.93577575683594
18051/28840	Now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them I have if agreeable to you thought of inviting	173.95387268066406
18052/28840	and Madame de Villefort to my countryhouse at Auteu	18.73581314086914
18053/28840	In that case your mother would hold me in aversion and I do not at all wish that on the contrary I desire to stand high in her	70.16015625
18054/28840	Indeed count said Morcerf I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you	53.912540435791016
18055/28840	You say you desire my mothers good opinion I assure you it is already yours to a very unusual	89.42105865478516

18060/28840	Well said he to Morcerf but I think your father will not be the only angry one	51.152950286865234
18061/28840	and Madame Danglars will think me a very illmannered	38.91920471191406

18080/28840	She is a remarkable woman and I only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case I assure you there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcer	56.318416595458984
18081/28840	As to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referend	45.953086853027344

18085/28840	I am not so much at liberty as you suppose on the contrary I have a most important	29.26679039001465
18086/28840	Ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an	99.0583724975586
18087/28840	I require the proof of a preeng	49.45570755004883
18088/28840	I am not a banker like	70.27489471435547
18089/28840	Danglars but I am quite as incredulous as he	17.262096405029297
18090/28840	I am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the	28.688552856445312
18091/28840	Humph said Morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid	40.76094436645508

18094/28840	I had no previous knowledge of your visit had I   Indeed you are such an extraordinary person that I would not answer for	46.549434661865234
18095/28840	At all events I could not guess that you would invite me to	45.898719787597656
18096/28840	Well listen Baptistin what did I tell you this morning when I called you into my laboratory   To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the val	55.38347625732422

18101/28840	The major will bring his son with him this evening the _contino_ as we say in Italy he confides him to my	115.76631164550781
18102/28840	If he proves himself worthy of it I will do what I can to advance his	105.47917175292969
18103/28840	You will assist me in the work will you not   Most	34.43085479736328
18104/28840	This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then   By no	17.2113037109375
18105/28840	He is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in Italy descendants of very ancient	128.7744903564453
18106/28840	I have met him several times at Florence Bologna and Lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in	43.33177185058594
18107/28840	This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire when he was on his way to	44.771610260009766

18111/28840	Have you Is he still amusing himself in Italy   I believe so however he regrets your absence	130.40257263183594
18112/28840	He says you were the sun of Rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it	57.76450729370117
18113/28840	His opinion of me is altered for the better then   No he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of	87.51897430419922
18114/28840	He is a charming young man said Monte Cristo and I felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when I met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of	47.47966384887695
18115/28840	He is I think the son of General dÉpinay   He	14.749410629272461
18116/28840	The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815   By the Bonapart	52.19601058959961
18117/28840	Really I like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him   Yes he is to marry Mademoiselle de Ville	28.56070899963379
18118/28840	Indeed   30115m       And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars said Albert	6.843560695648193
18119/28840	Why do you do so   I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my	47.67643737792969
18120/28840	But really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is unpardon	111.15615844726562
18121/28840	Are you going   Really that is a good ideatwo hours have I been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if I am	41.161399841308594
18122/28840	Indeed count you are the most polished man in the	56.32273864746094
18123/28840	And your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about	168.86053466796875
18124/28840	Monsieur Baptistin especially I could never get such a man as	46.98566436767578
18125/28840	My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner	162.69122314453125
18126/28840	Baptistin give me the refusal of	194.2854766845703
18127/28840	Ah ha you will do as much as that will you  	44.95271682739258
18128/28840	Well really nothing is certain in this	149.36399841308594

18130/28840	Nothing is impossible gravely replied Monte Cristo and taking leave of Albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three	66.62361145019531
18131/28840	Monsieur Bertuccio you understand that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteu	23.95667839050293
18132/28840	I shall require your services to see that all be properly	105.27035522460938
18133/28840	It is a beautiful house or at all events may be made	79.5233383178711
18134/28840	There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very	65.2411880493164
18135/28840	Let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleepingchamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it	52.991859436035156
18136/28840	You will not touch the garden either as to the yard you may do what you please with it I should prefer that being altered beyond all	91.7458267211914

18138/28840	I should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the	38.15913391113281
18139/28840	Bertuccio said the count since you have been in Paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand	54.39906311035156
18140/28840	But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   I do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do	34.4447135925293
18141/28840	Lucullus dines with Lucullus that is quite	76.81388092041016
18142/28840	Major Cavalcanti   Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining Alberts	51.09656524658203
18143/28840	Seven oclock had just struck and	131.27671813964844
18144/28840	Bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for Auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its	63.490020751953125
18145/28840	The visitor was about fiftytwo years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over	52.37540817260742
18146/28840	Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at	51.05058670043945
18147/28840	30 in the Avenue des ChampsÉlysées that the Count of Monte Cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the	26.404634475708008
18148/28840	The small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the	80.28845977783203
18149/28840	Therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his	64.66558074951172
18150/28840	He was ushered into a simple and elegant drawingroom and the count rose to meet him with a smiling	47.24665069580078
18151/28840	Ah my dear sir you are most welcome I was expecting	49.690521240234375
18152/28840	Indeed said the Italian was your excellency then aware of my visit   Yes I had been told that I should see you today at seven o	27.977073669433594
18153/28840	Then you have received full information concerning my arrival   Of	77.02022552490234
18154/28840	Ah so much the better I feared this little precaution might have been	65.87197875976562
18155/28840	30119m       What precaution   That of informing you beforehand of my	22.847614288330078
18156/28840	But you are sure you are not	28.012767791748047
18157/28840	It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening   I will prove it to you beyond a	51.00979995727539
18158/28840	Oh no never mind that said the Italian it is not worth the	66.97018432617188
18159/28840	Let me see said the count are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti   Bartolomeo Cavalcanti joyfully replied the Italian yes I am really	16.344900131225586
18160/28840	Exmajor in the Austrian service   Was I a major timidly asked the old	79.81908416748047
18161/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo you were a major that is the title the French give to the post which you filled in	62.539833068847656
18162/28840	Very good said the major I do not demand more you understand   Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said Monte Crist	49.17840576171875
18163/28840	You were sent by some other person  	38.16675567626953
18164/28840	By the excellent Abbé Busoni   Exactly so said the delighted	27.812725067138672
18165/28840	And you have a letter   Yes there it	29.34950828552246
18166/28840	And Monte Cristo took the letter which he opened and	30.24982452392578
18167/28840	The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the	28.58364486694336
18168/28840	Major Cavalcanti a worthy patrician of Lucca a descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence continued Monte Cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a	87.72926330566406
18169/28840	Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper and	61.43425750732422
18170/28840	Half a million said he magnificent   Half a million is it said the	90.46110534667969
18171/28840	Yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in	45.33308029174805
18172/28840	Be it half a million then but on my word of honor I had no idea that it was so	53.298912048339844
18173/28840	Because you are robbed by your stew	124.92713928222656
18174/28840	You must make some reformation in that	65.09722137451172
18175/28840	You have opened my eyes said the Italian gravely I will show the gentlemen the	89.38282012939453
18176/28840	Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter   And who only needs one thing more to make him	54.792869567871094
18177/28840	Yes indeed but one said the major with a	30.010488510131836
18178/28840	Which is to recover a lost and adored	162.9001922607422
18179/28840	A lost and adored son   Stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gyps	63.106937408447266
18180/28840	At the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to	40.38737869262695
18181/28840	The count continued   I have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen	52.620033264160156
18182/28840	The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of	14.251708984375
18183/28840	I have the power of so doing said Monte Crist	19.524147033691406
18184/28840	Ah true said Monte Cristo there is a post	20.942289352416992
18185/28840	In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker I send him a draft for 2000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48000 francs which you still owe	57.29689407348633
18186/28840	The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great	111.7877426147461
18187/28840	He said very good muttered the major thensir replied	675.0783081054688
18188/28840	Then the postscript   Well what of the postscript   Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter   Certainly the Abbé Busoni and myself have a small account open between	38.680973052978516
18189/28840	I do not remember if it is exactly 48000 francs which I am still owing him but I dare say we shall not dispute the	40.55147171020508
18190/28840	Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said Monte Crist	72.51731872558594
18191/28840	Why really I know no one said the	54.357200622558594
18192/28840	But then you yourself are known to others   Yes I am known so that   Proceed my dear Monsieur Cavalc	36.221107482910156
18193/28840	So that you will remit to me these 48000 francs   Certainly at your first	26.35352897644043
18194/28840	The majors eyes dilated with pleasing aston	101.46454620361328
18195/28840	But sit down said Monte Cristo really I do not know what I have been thinking ofI have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an	37.91330337524414
18196/28840	The major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat	52.779483795166016
18197/28840	Now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or Alicante   Alicante if you please it is my favorite	55.36235046386719

18205/28840	Pray dont mention such a thing said the	100.19368743896484
18206/28840	Baptistin reentered with glasses wine and	196.18106079101562
18207/28840	The count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored	100.79393005371094

18209/28840	The major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a bisc	130.9195098876953
18210/28840	The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the	57.16911697387695
18211/28840	30123m       So sir you lived at Lucca did you You were rich noble held in great esteemhad all that could render a man happy   All said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively	69.3711166381836
18212/28840	And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness   Only one thing said the	69.1508560180664
18213/28840	And that one thing your lost	358.2398376464844
18214/28840	Ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed	54.18341827392578
18215/28840	The worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and	98.1912841796875
18216/28840	Let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for I always understood you were a	125.69280242919922
18217/28840	That was the general opinion sir said the major and I   Yes replied the count and you confirmed the	45.03413391113281
18218/28840	Yes said the major I did wish this fault to be hidden from every	101.60277557373047
18219/28840	Not on your own account surely replied Monte Cristo for a man is above that sort of thing   Oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the	29.69408416748047
18220/28840	But for the sake of the mother said the	26.74950408935547
18221/28840	Yes for the mothers sakehis poor mother cried the major taking a third bisc	108.1668930053711
18222/28840	Take some more wine my dear Cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante your emotion has quite overcome	76.96592712402344
18223/28840	His poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false	64.71826171875
18224/28840	She belonged to one of the first families in Italy I think did she not   She was of a noble family of Fiesole	72.7983627319336
18225/28840	And her name was   Do you desire to know her name   Oh said Monte Cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for I already know	22.943971633911133
18226/28840	The count knows everything said the Italian b	88.79039764404297
18227/28840	Oliva Corsinari was it not   Oliva Corsinari   A marchioness   A marchioness   And you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family   Yes that was the way it	27.08997917175293
18228/28840	And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said Monte Crist	60.29653549194336
18229/28840	What papers   The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari and the register of your childs	35.47430419921875
18230/28840	The register of my childs birth   The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcantiof your son is not his name Andrea   I believe so said the	42.56711959838867
18231/28840	What You believe so   I dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a	36.82228469848633
18232/28840	Well then said Monte Cristo you have all the documents with you   Your excellency I regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers I neglected to bring	38.685977935791016
18233/28840	Were they then so necessary   They were	218.53823852539062
18234/28840	The major passed his hand across his	40.01813507080078
18235/28840	Ah _perbacco_ indispensable were they   Certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child   True said the major there might be doubts	73.23147583007812
18236/28840	In that case your son would be very unpleasantly	60.847007751464844
18237/28840	It would be fatal to his	177.99501037597656
18238/28840	It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial	73.68789672851562
18239/28840	_O peccato_   You must know that in France they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in Italy to go to the priest and say We love each other and want you to marry	85.26589965820312
18240/28840	Marriage is a civil affair in France and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your	106.68096160888672
18241/28840	That is the misfortune You see I have not these necessary	182.30104064941406
18242/28840	Fortunately I have them though said Monte Crist	46.04866027832031
18243/28840	You have them   I have	43.108062744140625
18244/28840	I do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything but happily the Abbé Busoni thought for	65.0831298828125
18245/28840	He is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you   Here they	30.50630760192871
18246/28840	The major clasped his hands in token of	38.88258743286133
18247/28840	You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del MonteCattini here is the priests	50.1589469909668
18248/28840	Yes indeed there it is truly said the Italian looking on with aston	71.45645141601562
18249/28840	And here is Andrea Cavalcantis baptismal register given by the curé of Sarave	44.85989761352539
18250/28840	Take these documents then they do not concern	130.4593048095703
18251/28840	You will give them to your son who will of course take great care of	61.401485443115234
18252/28840	I should think so indeed If he were to lose them   Well and if he were to lose them said Monte Crist	36.82098388671875
18253/28840	In that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be	33.85052490234375
18254/28840	It would be a difficult matter to arrange said Monte Crist	37.806087493896484
18255/28840	I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these	33.507301330566406
18256/28840	Now said Monte Cristo as to the mother of the young man   As to the mother of the young man repeated the Italian with	31.83024787902832
18257/28840	I knew that said Monte Cristo she has been dead these ten	48.34501647949219
18258/28840	And I am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right	99.49987030029297
18259/28840	What would you have said Monte Cristo we are all	26.020414352416992
18260/28840	Now you understand my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen	25.63761329650879
18261/28840	Stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be	68.41983032226562
18262/28840	You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian	59.204776763916016
18263/28840	That is the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio where you have lived since the death of your	50.771575927734375
18264/28840	If they should hear of the separation   Ah yes what could I say   That an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family   By the Corsinari   Precise	44.815460205078125
18265/28840	Had stolen away this child in order that your name might become	154.59947204589844
18266/28840	That is reasonable since he is an only	69.413330078125
18267/28840	Well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be	153.3675537109375
18268/28840	You have doubtless already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you   An agreeable one asked the	96.67021179199219
18269/28840	Ah I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his	54.72573471069336
18270/28840	Someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was	103.75260925292969
18271/28840	That who was here   Your childyour sonyour Andrea   I did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible cool	65.67987060546875
18272/28840	Then he is here   He is said Monte Cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his	24.29848861694336
18273/28840	Ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each ex	56.095802307128906
18274/28840	My dear sir said Monte Cristo I understand your emotion you must have time to recover	38.91387939453125
18275/28840	I will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this muchdesired interview for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than	65.71511840820312
18276/28840	I should quite imagine that to be the case said Cavalc	47.67405319213867
18277/28840	Well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with	31.86798667907715
18278/28840	You will bring him then You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself   No I do not wish to come between a father and	51.464168548583984
18279/28840	But do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this	158.4156494140625
18280/28840	He is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for	81.91761779785156
18281/28840	By the way said the major you know I have only the 2000 francs which the Abbé Busoni sent me this sum I have expended upon travelling expenses and   And you want money that is a matter of course my dear	36.97132873535156
18282/28840	Well here are 8000 francs on	70.32018280029297
18283/28840	It is 40000 francs which I now owe you said Monte Crist	23.985658645629883
18284/28840	Does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his	49.93330001831055
18285/28840	I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Bus	24.099655151367188
18286/28840	Well when you receive the remaining 40000 you shall give me a receipt in	110.66986846923828
18287/28840	Between honest men such excessive precaution is I think quite	223.9038543701172
18288/28840	Yes so it is between perfectly upright	397.2757568359375
18289/28840	You will permit me to make one remark   Certainly pray do	39.978939056396484
18290/28840	Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of	160.04212951660156
18291/28840	Indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete	38.20507049560547
18292/28840	It may be worn at Via Reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in	135.0680694580078
18293/28840	Oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave	61.65656280517578
18294/28840	But what shall I wear   What you find in your tr	73.40547943115234
18295/28840	In my trunks I have but one portmante	27.006702423095703
18296/28840	I dare say you have nothing else with	50.30234909057617
18297/28840	What is the use of boring ones self with so many things Besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as	91.80438232421875
18298/28840	But you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before	64.0628662109375
18299/28840	It has arrived at the Hôtel des Princes Rue de Richel	9.997652053833008
18300/28840	It is there you are to take up your	93.20906066894531
18301/28840	Then in these trunks   I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to needyour plain clothes and your	50.189781188964844
18302/28840	On grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very	163.66705322265625
18303/28840	They still laugh at them in France and yet always wear them for all	124.51850128173828
18304/28840	Very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the	62.41777420043945
18305/28840	Now said Monte Cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear	64.54131317138672
18306/28840	Saying which Monte Cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the	58.22766876220703
18307/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti   The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room which Baptistin had designated as the drawingroom and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour	36.484649658203125
18308/28840	Baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for adm	71.97821044921875
18309/28840	He was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to	63.737754821777344
18310/28840	When the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the goldheaded cane which he held in his	33.408905029296875
18311/28840	On perceiving the count he rose	39.423728942871094
18312/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo I believe said	18.973413467407227
18313/28840	Yes sir and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea Cavalcanti   Count Andrea Cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a	15.88737964630127
18314/28840	You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the	34.59577941894531
18315/28840	I did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so	65.26549530029297
18316/28840	The letter signed Sinbad the Sailor is it not   Exactly	17.817232131958008
18317/28840	Ah indeed Then that explains everything that is extraordinary said	217.73045349121094
18318/28840	He is then the same Englishman whom I metatahyes	192.0133819580078
18319/28840	Well monsieur I am at your	11.635442733764648
18320/28840	If what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family   Certainly I will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready	31.837648391723633
18321/28840	I am as you have said the Count Andrea Cavalcanti son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti a descendant of the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at	22.767147064208984
18322/28840	Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master I have been constantly seeking him but all in	112.74473571777344
18323/28840	At length I received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in Paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting	73.67798614501953
18324/28840	Really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said Monte Cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend Sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking	46.44697952270508
18325/28840	The expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now	45.67879867553711
18326/28840	Ah yes that is the name	193.62660217285156
18327/28840	And you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here   Yes sir and I can even add that I have only just left his	29.274486541748047
18328/28840	The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic	153.97789001464844
18329/28840	At length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of	73.09635925292969
18330/28840	Your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of Piedmont with a passport signed for	75.76683044433594
18331/28840	You were in the south of France I think   Yes replied Andrea with an embarrassed air I was in the south of	30.14068603515625
18332/28840	30133m       Indeed Then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this	34.841224670410156
18333/28840	But said Andrea if my father had met me I doubt if he would have recognized me I must be somewhat altered since he last saw	86.87202453613281
18334/28840	Oh the voice of nature said Monte Crist	36.60417556762695
18335/28840	True interrupted the young man I had not looked upon it in that	32.516910552978516
18336/28840	Sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded I hope no false report   As for myself I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore the philanthrop	65.50828552246094
18337/28840	I believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for I did not ask not being inquis	71.61773681640625
18338/28840	Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been	73.93402099609375
18339/28840	He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found	44.943389892578125
18340/28840	He did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future	113.53108215332031
18341/28840	I am quite aware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and I have promised to adhere to his	54.01642990112305
18342/28840	Now sir pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your	49.95220947265625
18343/28840	I have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in Asia Minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman	75.3436508178711
18344/28840	Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from	72.63886260986328
18345/28840	Besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette I suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my	68.12439727783203
18346/28840	Well said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if I were you I would not divulge a word of these	44.435340881347656
18347/28840	Your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like	152.62852478027344
18348/28840	This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to represent to you my dear	42.819454193115234
18349/28840	You would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and	150.88487243652344
18350/28840	You would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the	67.99449157714844
18351/28840	You might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant	92.29302978515625
18352/28840	I agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely	29.47171401977539
18353/28840	Nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said Monte Cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into	62.2976188659668
18354/28840	You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former	78.7379379272461
18355/28840	However your excellency said Andrea in consideration of Lord Wilmore by whom I was recommended to you   Yes certainly interrupted Monte Cristo but Lord Wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear	23.649539947509766
18356/28840	Andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy	247.43194580078125

18360/28840	In short you will find your father a very presentable person I assure	98.65792846679688
18361/28840	Ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that I have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all	44.92716979980469
18362/28840	He is a millionairehis income is 500000 franc	42.5643310546875

18370/28840	He has at the request of your father opened an account of 5000 francs a month at	60.61157989501953
18371/28840	Danglars which is one of the safest banks in	21.77836799621582

18374/28840	His service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks	64.021484375
18375/28840	Ah my dear father exclaimed Andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy	48.96484375
18376/28840	Therefore said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his meaningtherefore I will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your	82.38636016845703
18377/28840	Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father   I hope you do not doubt	43.42234420776367

18379/28840	Andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining	64.177001953125
18380/28840	The young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching	54.60236740112305
18381/28840	Ah my dear father said Andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you   How do you do my dear son said the major grave	26.93948745727539
18382/28840	After so many years of painful separation said Andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again   Indeed it is after so long a	54.94938659667969
18383/28840	Will you not embrace me sir said	116.92935943603516

18385/28840	Then we are once more reunited said	169.76541137695312

18387/28840	The fact is said the young man that I should be exceedingly grieved to leave	48.056007385253906
18388/28840	As for me you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I	53.2852783203125

18390/28840	Certainly I am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but I had resolved on giving them into your hands and if I had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my	68.4874267578125
18391/28840	Where are these papers then   Here they	35.12394714355469
18392/28840	Whywhat do you mean by that question   I mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as	40.44622802734375
18393/28840	In France my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to Toulon for five years for change of	74.85830688476562
18394/28840	Will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest	55.02303695678711
18395/28840	Make yourself easy we are quite alone said Andrea besides we are conversing in	82.501708984375
18396/28840	Well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs	77.2186508178711

18398/28840	You have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth The major drew from his pocket a handful of	55.585819244384766
18399/28840	Most palpable proofs said he as you may	227.10006713867188

18430/28840	At all events it is neither you nor	63.07875061035156

18436/28840	On hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each others arms and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count	36.83750915527344
18437/28840	Well marquis said Monte Cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to	51.228179931640625

18441/28840	Happy father happy son said the	154.66671752929688
18442/28840	There is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so	64.27840423583984

18472/28840	At what hour shall we come asked the young	72.94597625732422
18473/28840	We will be with you at that time said the	27.573810577392578
18474/28840	The two Cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the	37.88492202758789
18475/28840	Monte Cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in	80.95695495605469
18476/28840	There go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related Then after an instant of gloomy reflection Come I will go to see the Morrels said he I think that disgust is even more sickening than	122.40794372558594
18477/28840	In the Lucern Patch   Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding	67.15824890136719
18478/28840	de Villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our	51.63344955444336
18479/28840	This time Maximilian was the first to	36.85449981689453
18480/28840	He was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel	99.61475372314453
18481/28840	At length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching	93.44874572753906
18482/28840	The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was	33.006351470947266
18483/28840	The young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comfort	74.3637466430664
18484/28840	It is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man Valentine did not suffer by the	73.6549072265625
18485/28840	In about half an hour the girls went away and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars visit had at last come to an	29.76410484313965
18486/28840	In a few minutes Valentine reentered the garden	45.74733352661133
18487/28840	Goodevening Maximilian I know I have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my	65.50685119628906
18488/28840	I was not aware that you were so intimate with	26.515287399291992
18489/28840	Who told you we were intimate Maximilian   No one but you appeared to be	40.75235366821289
18490/28840	From the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each	122.92735290527344
18491/28840	We were having a confidential conversation returned Valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with	76.94483184814453
18492/28840	de Morcerf and I on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying	55.840858459472656
18493/28840	Dear Valentine   That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and Eugénie as in speaking of the man whom I could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were	52.785831451416016
18494/28840	Ah how good you are to say so Valentine You possess a quality which can never belong to Mademoiselle Dangl	33.121089935302734
18495/28840	It is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we	116.70331573486328
18496/28840	It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that	114.5476303100586
18497/28840	No Valentine I assure you such is not the	73.5418701171875
18498/28840	I was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars I cannot understand how any man can really love	39.95128631591797
18499/28840	The fact is Maximilian that I was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your	78.0855712890625
18500/28840	No but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle Danglars   I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to	30.56903839111328
18501/28840	It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted	169.71514892578125
18502/28840	You cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each	81.36970520019531
18503/28840	If we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of	90.87419891357422

18509/28840	Then why did you smile   Why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself	44.80419158935547
18510/28840	Do you want me to go away   Ah no	35.92831039428711

18512/28840	True we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass	98.44373321533203
18513/28840	Yes you are right I am but a poor friend to	31.36273765563965
18514/28840	What a life I cause you to lead poor Maximilian you who are formed for happiness I bitterly reproach myself I assure	81.1910400390625
18515/28840	You must hope for us both Maximilian that will make me at least partly	65.9999771118164
18516/28840	But why must you leave me so soon   I do not know	41.342288970947266
18517/28840	I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune	41.47916793823242
18518/28840	Let them take my fortune I am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quiet	85.86689758300781
18519/28840	You would love me as much if I were poor would you not Maximilian   Oh I shall always love	34.07190704345703
18520/28840	What should I care for either riches or poverty if my Valentine was near me and I felt certain that no one could deprive me of her But do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage   I do not think that is the	50.431907653808594
18521/28840	However it may be Valentine you must not be	80.27486419677734
18522/28840	I assure you that as long as I live I shall never love anyone else   Do you think to reassure me when you say that Maximilian   Pardon me you are	22.53186798095703
18523/28840	But I was going to tell you that I met	21.56675910949707
18524/28840	Well   Monsieur Franz is his friend you	26.760725021362305
18525/28840	What then   Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz announcing his immediate	26.380796432495117
18526/28840	Valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the	64.27899169921875
18527/28840	Ah heavens if it were that But no the communication would not come through Madame de Ville	92.58597564697266
18528/28840	Why not   BecauseI scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if Madame de Villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose	59.0615348815918
18529/28840	Is it so Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Ville	40.635101318359375
18530/28840	Do not be in such a hurry to do that said Valentine with a sad	47.474830627441406
18531/28840	If she objects to your marrying	426.7173156738281
18532/28840	dÉpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other	61.83356857299805
18533/28840	No Maximilian it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects it is marriage	55.05038070678711
18534/28840	Marriage If she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself   You do not understand me Maximil	58.65388870239258
18535/28840	About a year ago I talked of retiring to a	111.25638580322266
18536/28840	Madame de Villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the	53.406253814697266
18537/28840	You can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and I had almost said by whom he is beloved in	67.1584701538086
18538/28840	When he learned my resolution I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless	109.35574340820312
18539/28840	Ah Maximilian I experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet I exclaimedForgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me I will never leave	62.87028884887695
18540/28840	When I had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a	45.65457534790039
18541/28840	Ah Maximilian I may have much to suffer but I feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for	47.392555236816406
18542/28840	Noirtier evidently intends making me his	141.2913818359375
18543/28840	My brother Edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with	135.12965393066406
18544/28840	Now if I had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his	70.05899047851562
18545/28840	Ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avar	71.46961212158203
18546/28840	It is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal	136.53274536132812
18547/28840	No human being not even my sister is aware of its	138.73263549804688
18548/28840	Valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you   Valentine	39.70433807373047
18549/28840	A friend Maximilian and who is this friend I tremble to give my	59.63593292236328
18550/28840	Well that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first saw that extraordinary	152.6028289794922
18551/28840	Extraordinary did you say  	57.21111297607422
18552/28840	You have known him for some time then   Scarcely longer than eight or ten	48.13395690917969
18553/28840	And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days Ah Maximilian I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of	73.35813903808594
18554/28840	Your logic is most powerful Valentine but say what you will I can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my	110.99171447753906
18555/28840	He must be a prophet then said Valentine	79.61112213134766
18556/28840	Indeed said Maximilian I have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future	39.80919647216797
18557/28840	Ah said Valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man Maximilian he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all I have	50.438568115234375
18558/28840	My poor girl you know him	184.6898651123047
18559/28840	I know him   Yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her	25.408205032348633
18560/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo   The	8.956174850463867
18561/28840	Ah cried Valentine he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort ever to be	38.64061737060547
18562/28840	The friend of Madame de Villefort It cannot be surely Valentine you are mistaken   No indeed I am not for I assure you his power over our household is almost	52.1964225769043
18563/28840	de Monte Cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our	48.56474304199219
18564/28840	If such be the case my dear Valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his	95.53963470458984
18565/28840	This man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and	145.71646118164062
18566/28840	I never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnific	184.1533660888672
18567/28840	His smile is so sweet when he addresses me that I forget it ever can be bitter to	125.2070083618164
18568/28840	Ah Valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if so depend on it you will be	53.962589263916016
18569/28840	Me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if I accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid	101.41917419433594
18570/28840	You say he loves you Maximilian how do you know that he does All would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with	55.3069953918457
18571/28840	Ah Valentine I assure you you are	31.61797523498535
18572/28840	Who knows but that in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power It is not just that he should despise me so without any	54.99022674560547
18573/28840	Ah forgive me said Valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on Maximilian I have done wrong for I have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know existed in my	50.82707214355469
18574/28840	I do not deny the influence of which you speak or that I have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than	54.23461151123047
18575/28840	Well Valentine said Morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter	55.29077911376953
18576/28840	I will not make a confidant of	23.668127059936523
18577/28840	Alas said Valentine I see that I have given you	56.505393981933594
18578/28840	I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved	52.971534729003906
18579/28840	But indeed I am not prejudiced beyond the power of	74.82861328125
18580/28840	Tell me what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for	39.1567268371582
18581/28840	30157m       I own that your question embarrasses me Valentine for I cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible	27.186079025268555
18582/28840	Still as I have already told you I have an instinctive affection for him the source of which I cannot explain to	31.36361312866211
18583/28840	Has the sun done anything for me No he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that I see younothing	213.6885528564453
18584/28840	Has such and such a perfume done anything for me No its odor charms one of my sensesthat is all I can say when I am asked why I praise	127.44857788085938
18585/28840	My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for	163.54299926757812
18586/28840	A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of	72.34576416015625
18587/28840	In his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts I find a relation to my	81.43949890136719
18588/28840	You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that ever since I have known this man I have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from	46.488216400146484
18589/28840	However I have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my	105.92251586914062
18590/28840	He invited me to dine with him on Saturday which was a very natural thing for him to	45.50178146362305
18591/28840	Well what have I learned since That your mother and	266.53118896484375
18592/28840	de Villefort are both coming to this	107.62077331542969
18593/28840	I shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless I perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the	120.10396575927734
18594/28840	I believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet	76.89952850341797
18595/28840	and Madame de Villefort and sometimes I confess I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our	30.915245056152344
18596/28840	My good friend said Valentine I should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if I were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to	69.52688598632812
18597/28840	Is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting Pray reflect a	96.12532806396484
18598/28840	I feel the same as regards	75.37416076660156
18599/28840	said Valentine and I own that if you have no stronger proof to give me   I have another replied Maximilian but I fear you will deem it even more absurd than the	37.14790344238281
18600/28840	So much the worse said Valentine	74.6219482421875
18601/28840	It is nevertheless conclusive to my	126.32273864746094
18602/28840	Dear Maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety When you are away I no longer pray for myself but for	105.05242156982422
18603/28840	30159m       Yes since you have known me said Morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance	36.46105194091797
18604/28840	You are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be	69.80826568603516
18605/28840	Well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which I rode	141.25372314453125
18606/28840	Ah what a beautiful creature cried Valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that I could talk to him and pat him   He is as you see a very valuable animal said Maximil	43.8533821105957
18607/28840	You know that my means are limited and that I am what would be designated a man of moderate pret	79.91749572753906
18608/28840	Well I went to a horse dealers where I saw this magnificent horse which I have named Médé	43.71467208862305
18609/28840	I asked the price they told me it was 4500 franc	40.086021423339844
18610/28840	The same evening some friends of mine visited me	449.4045715332031
18611/28840	Debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by	81.47282409667969
18612/28840	I never play for I am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to	88.49642181396484
18613/28840	But I was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which I	49.30908966064453
18614/28840	Just as they were sitting down to table	76.51167297363281
18615/28840	He took his seat amongst them they played and I	243.8667755126953
18616/28840	I am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5000 franc	34.36960220336914
18617/28840	I could not defer my pleasure so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse	38.88491439819336
18618/28840	Feverish and excited I rang at the	275.5865478515625
18619/28840	The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for I rushed at once to the	56.1651496887207
18620/28840	Médéah was standing at the rack eating his	80.07813262939453
18621/28840	As I rode by the counts house I perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the	67.03999328613281
18622/28840	Now Valentine I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring	92.34114837646484
18623/28840	My dear Maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me	62.582820892333984
18624/28840	A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common everyday sort of attachment such as	125.00132751464844
18625/28840	Do you hear   Ah Valentine said Maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that I may have the happiness of kissing	52.480770111083984
18626/28840	Maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two	114.9091796875
18627/28840	Shall you be happy if I do what you wish   Oh yes   Valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the	70.39392852783203
18628/28840	Maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned	51.56972122192383
18629/28840	The little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own	74.1291275024414
18630/28840	de Villefort entered his fathers room followed by Madame de Ville	16.197601318359375
18631/28840	Both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to Barrois a faithful servant who had been twentyfive years in his service took their places on either side of the paraly	31.881074905395508
18632/28840	Noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at	44.91769027709961
18633/28840	He was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around	66.14517974853516
18634/28840	Noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official	85.34439849853516
18635/28840	He commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were	246.5968475341797
18636/28840	Three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were Villefort Valentine and the old servant of whom we have already	80.80307006835938
18637/28840	But as Villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his	79.0746841430664
18638/28840	Valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in Noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his	56.40245056152344
18639/28840	Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to	54.85519027709961
18640/28840	As we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so	47.78901672363281
18641/28840	Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to	32.39452362060547
18642/28840	Noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary Villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans	39.27995681762695
18643/28840	This communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approb	106.00785827636719
18644/28840	The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing	69.5477066040039
18645/28840	Sir resumed Villefort we are thinking of marrying	48.34305953979492
18646/28840	Had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced	125.25991821289062
18647/28840	The marriage will take place in less than three months said Ville	30.614654541015625
18648/28840	Noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate	113.3104248046875
18649/28840	It is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely happyhis name moreover cannot be wholly unknown to	95.1192626953125
18650/28840	While his wife was speaking Villefort had narrowly watched the old mans count	38.219200134277344
18651/28840	When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of Franz the pupil of	29.175453186035156
18652/28840	Noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his	32.477867126464844
18653/28840	The procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between	141.48143005371094
18654/28840	Noirtier and the elder dÉpinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his	93.5248794555664
18655/28840	Sir said he you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable	70.48787689208984
18656/28840	Villefort quietly opened a window saying It is very warm and the heat affects	92.97693634033203
18657/28840	He then returned to his place but did not sit	49.532047271728516
18658/28840	This marriage added Madame de Villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of	25.71849250793457
18659/28840	That assassination was a mysterious affair said Villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one	77.87384033203125
18660/28840	Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a	54.31399917602539
18661/28840	Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered	71.3714599609375
18662/28840	Yes I understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound	104.96990203857422
18663/28840	Villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his	44.60417175292969
18664/28840	He then motioned to his wife to take	55.633365631103516
18665/28840	Now sir said Madame de Villefort I must bid you	30.817867279052734
18666/28840	If he wanted Valentine he closed his right eye only and if Barrois the	100.18189239501953
18667/28840	At Madame de Villeforts proposition he instantly winked his	27.592710494995117
18668/28840	Provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said Then shall I send Valentine to you The old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his	144.46913146972656
18669/28840	and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the	47.2901725769043
18670/28840	Valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted	82.18601989746094
18671/28840	One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to	47.472251892089844
18672/28840	Dear grandpapa cried she what has happened They have vexed you and you are angry   The paralytic closed his eyes in token of ass	35.84788131713867
18673/28840	Who has displeased you Is it my father  	23.331933975219727
18674/28840	Are you displeased with me cried Valentine in aston	51.17102813720703
18675/28840	And what have I done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried	31.72039222717285
18676/28840	There was no answer and she continued   I have not seen you all	46.051326751708984
18677/28840	Has anyone been speaking to you against me   Yes said the old mans look with eager	44.623172760009766
18678/28840	and Madame de Villefort have just left this room have they not  	24.728904724121094
18679/28840	And it was they who told you something which made you angry What was it then May I go and ask them that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you   No no said Noirtiers	59.78614807128906
18680/28840	What can they have said and she again tried to think what it could	65.7530746459961
18681/28840	Ah I know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old	40.737518310546875
18682/28840	They have been speaking of my marriagehave they not   Yes replied the angry	73.03500366210938
18683/28840	I understand you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the	36.22762680053711
18684/28840	The reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of	67.58824920654297
18685/28840	They did not even acquaint me with their intentions and I only discovered them by chance that is why I have been so reserved with you dear grandp	53.91450500488281
18686/28840	But there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was It is not only your reserve which afflicts	106.03247833251953
18687/28840	What is it then asked the young	21.12314224243164
18688/28840	Perhaps you think I shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that I shall forget you when I am married  	27.412927627563477
18689/28840	dÉpinay consented to our all living together  	65.96039581298828
18690/28840	Then why are you still vexed and grieved The old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle	49.787357330322266
18691/28840	Yes I understand said Valentine it is because you love	30.93456268310547
18692/28840	And you are afraid I shall be unhappy  	41.43761444091797
18693/28840	Franz The eyes repeated several times No no	306.3543395996094
18694/28840	Then you are vexed with the engagement  	32.115299224853516
18695/28840	Well listen said Valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck I am vexed too for I do not love	53.62504959106445
18696/28840	An expression of intense joy illumined the old mans	43.49256896972656
18697/28840	When I wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me A tear trembled in the eye of the	91.9906997680664
18698/28840	Well continued Valentine the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to	87.44068145751953
18699/28840	Alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in	54.46799850463867
18700/28840	However this is much and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and	164.0081329345703
18701/28840	At these words there appeared in Noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there You are mistaken I can still do much for	49.85062026977539
18702/28840	Do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said	26.698638916015625
18703/28840	Noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and Valentine when he wanted	56.70629119873047
18704/28840	She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to	160.03411865234375
18705/28840	When she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he	88.21309661865234
18706/28840	Ah said Valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter N it is with N that we have to do	189.66246032714844
18707/28840	Well let me see what can you want that begins with N NaNeNiNo   Yes yes yes said the old mans	26.83662223815918
18708/28840	Ah it is No then  	43.18584060668945
18709/28840	Valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before Noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the	55.28152847290039
18710/28840	At the word _Notary_ Noirtier made a sign to her to	28.96746253967285
18711/28840	30169m       Notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa The old man again signified that it was a notary he	28.0053768157959
18712/28840	You would wish a notary to be sent for then said	65.59705352783203
18713/28840	Shall my father be informed of your wish  	61.68099594116211
18714/28840	Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately  	39.42594528198242
18715/28840	Then they shall go for him directly dear grandp	102.60993194580078
18716/28840	Is that all you want  	41.02432632446289
18717/28840	Valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to	33.68624496459961
18718/28840	I am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover	31.43739891052246
18719/28840	And the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a	36.95472717285156
18720/28840	What do you want me for sir demanded he of the paraly	61.84126281738281
18721/28840	Sir said Valentine my grandfather wishes for a not	67.5628662109375
18722/28840	At this strange and unexpected demand	569.580810546875
18723/28840	de Villefort and his father exchanged	42.124427795410156
18724/28840	Yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the	53.887428283691406
18725/28840	Do you wish for a notary asked Ville	27.69805145263672
18726/28840	What to do   Noirtier made no	18.232816696166992
18727/28840	What do you want with a notary again repeated Ville	38.48096466064453
18728/28840	The invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalter	183.83425903320312
18729/28840	Is it to do us some ill turn Do you think it is worth while said Ville	67.65328979492188
18730/28840	Still said Barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if	78.4219970703125
18731/28840	Noirtier asks for a notary I suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore I shall go at once and fetch	58.904624938964844
18732/28840	Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be	110.36463928222656
18733/28840	30171m       Yes I do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and I should like to see the person who dares to refuse my	28.520112991333008
18734/28840	You shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said Villefort but I shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous	49.20941925048828
18735/28840	Never mind that said Barrois I shall go and fetch a notary	53.887969970703125
18736/28840	And the old servant departed triumphantly on his	175.18458557128906
18737/28840	The Will   As soon as Barrois had left the room Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many	26.801904678344727
18738/28840	The young girl perfectly understood the look and so did Villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows	56.06200408935547
18739/28840	He took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the not	51.77360916137695
18740/28840	Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at Valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the	49.95945358276367
18741/28840	Threequarters of an hour after Barrois returned bringing the notary with	50.67399597167969
18742/28840	Sir said Villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by	32.934837341308594
18743/28840	All his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his	154.33358764648438
18744/28840	Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered	93.4708480834961
18745/28840	Sir said she I perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all	96.92383575439453
18746/28840	That is quite true said Barrois and that is what I told the gentleman as we walked	52.710662841796875
18747/28840	Permit me said the notary turning first to Villefort and then to Valentinepermit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous	98.04367065429688
18748/28840	The first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the	74.7191162109375
18749/28840	An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procure	35.658180236816406
18750/28840	Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the not	30.98615264892578
18751/28840	Sir said she the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and I can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as I can	56.83671951293945
18752/28840	Will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject   In order to render an act valid I must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my	35.6756591796875
18753/28840	Illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely	109.40060424804688
18754/28840	Well sir by the help of two signs with which I will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental	78.53350830078125
18755/28840	Noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means	135.4761199951172
18756/28840	You now know quite enough to enable you to converse with	57.65141296386719
18757/28840	Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary	46.660316467285156
18758/28840	You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the not	80.15586853027344
18759/28840	And you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts  	63.82671356201172
18760/28840	It was you who sent for me  	30.43468475341797
18761/28840	To make your will  	97.81947326660156
18762/28840	And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions The old man winked	51.462646484375
18763/28840	Well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject   But before the notary could answer Villefort had drawn him	54.35416793823242
18764/28840	Sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as	58.28366470336914
18765/28840	Noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties   It is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his	43.631649017333984
18766/28840	You must see that to be an utter impossibility said Ville	37.3100471496582
18767/28840	Valentine and the old man heard this conversation and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the	52.60198211669922
18768/28840	Sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to	175.0829315185547
18769/28840	I can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the	64.49661254882812
18770/28840	I have now been six years with	96.57051086425781
18771/28840	Noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me	49.143314361572266
18772/28840	Let us try what we can do then said the not	62.68801498413086
18773/28840	You accept this young lady as your interpreter	175.25575256347656
18774/28840	Well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up   Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to	59.346439361572266
18775/28840	At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to	47.622314453125
18776/28840	It is very evident that it is the letter W which	118.00749206542969
18777/28840	Wait said Valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated WaWeWi The old man stopped her at the last syll	36.22172927856445
18778/28840	Valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the	55.17129135131836
18779/28840	She passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word Will	95.80619049072266
18780/28840	Will said the notary it is very evident that	30.74828338623047
18781/28840	Noirtier is desirous of making his	39.072505950927734
18782/28840	Really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to	72.77889251708984
18783/28840	No no no replied the eye of the paraly	41.89051818847656
18784/28840	What said Villefort do you mean to say that Valentine is not interested in your will  	21.78184700012207
18785/28840	As to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of	70.87232208251953
18786/28840	There are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the	106.80469512939453
18787/28840	As to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the	98.24897766113281
18788/28840	But besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the	61.98991775512695
18789/28840	Are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old	37.86927032470703
18790/28840	30175m       Yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his	31.845632553100586
18791/28840	What is he going to do thought Villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions	80.26790618896484
18792/28840	He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but Barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch	49.02402114868164
18793/28840	The procureur then told his wife to come	136.7577362060547
18794/28840	In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic the second notary had also	32.588321685791016
18795/28840	A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the	51.93657302856445
18796/28840	Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune  	44.500057220458984
18797/28840	I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions  	51.07763671875
18798/28840	There was a kind of solemnity in this	43.15056228637695
18799/28840	Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious	102.95147705078125
18800/28840	They had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have	74.18344116210938
18801/28840	Your fortune exceeds 300000 francs does it not asked	58.04232406616211
18802/28840	Noirtier made a sign that it	15.859503746032715
18803/28840	Do you possess 400000 francs inquired the not	32.883785247802734
18804/28840	600000700000800000900000   Noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed	40.4725227355957
18805/28840	You are then in possession of 900000 francs asked the not	21.7423152923584
18806/28840	The stock is in your own hands   The look which	87.83612823486328
18807/28840	Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to	50.14329528808594
18808/28840	The old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small c	100.58132934570312
18809/28840	Do you permit us to open this casket asked the not	79.17467498779297
18810/28840	They opened it and found 900000 francs in bank sc	87.64568328857422
18811/28840	The first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his	149.62646484375
18812/28840	The total amount was found to be as	394.5284118652344
18813/28840	It is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vig	58.085601806640625
18814/28840	Then turning towards the paralytic he said You possess then 900000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40000 livres  	42.1208610534668
18815/28840	To whom do you desire to leave this fortune   Oh said Madame de Villefort there is not much doubt on that	20.921836853027344
18816/28840	The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to	47.69258499145508
18817/28840	Valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was	122.58995819091797
18818/28840	The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of	27.83066749572754
18819/28840	What said the notary do you not intend making Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee  	18.917448043823242
18820/28840	You are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention   No repeated Noirtier	42.777099609375
18821/28840	Valentine raised her head struck dumb with aston	53.23733901977539
18822/28840	It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an	46.966949462890625
18823/28840	But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed   Oh grandpapa I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which I have always	32.897132873535156
18824/28840	Ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not	51.31731033325195
18825/28840	The old mans declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said   Then doubtless dear	63.7784309387207
18826/28840	Noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson Edward de Villefort   The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to	84.72297668457031
18827/28840	No said the notary then perhaps it is to your son	51.6597785949707
18828/28840	The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the test	57.759822845458984
18829/28840	Villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from	150.82301330566406
18830/28840	What have we all done then dear grandpapa said Valentine you no longer seem to love any of us   The old mans eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fond	34.355560302734375
18831/28840	Well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present	91.28893280029297
18832/28840	You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune besides they say I am already rich in right of my mothertoo rich	49.034950256347656
18833/28840	Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentines	34.776309967041016
18834/28840	Oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impaired said Ville	40.02928924560547
18835/28840	It is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa   Yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on Valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his	53.76860046386719
18836/28840	30179m       You are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not   Yes   Really this is too absurd said Ville	16.764968872070312
18837/28840	Excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of	46.36115646362305
18838/28840	Noirtier is quite evident to me and I can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his	51.678627014160156
18839/28840	You do not wish me to marry	14.81406307220459
18840/28840	I do not wish it said the eye of her	31.767065048217773
18841/28840	And you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes  	62.4692268371582
18842/28840	So that but for this marriage she would have been your heir  	50.342491149902344
18843/28840	The two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the	104.42274475097656
18844/28840	But said Villefort who was the first to break the silence I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in	35.00141525268555
18845/28840	I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters	54.18505859375
18846/28840	It is my wish that she should marry	115.83809661865234
18847/28840	Sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying	20.640281677246094
18848/28840	Franz The old man gave no	148.70445251464844
18849/28840	You will of course dispose of it in some way or other  	37.30238342285156
18850/28840	In favor of some member of your family  	39.13239669799805
18851/28840	Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the not	106.25502014160156
18852/28840	But said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony  	25.73711395263672
18853/28840	You only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son Noirtier made no	46.17729949951172
18854/28840	Do you still wish to dispose of all  	28.729711532592773
18855/28840	But they will contest the will after your death  	123.72599792480469
18856/28840	My father knows me replied Villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position I cannot plead against the	65.7254867553711
18857/28840	The eye of Noirtier beamed with	76.35298919677734
18858/28840	What do you decide on sir asked the notary of Ville	39.27188491821289
18859/28840	Nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know he never alters his	52.264278411865234
18860/28840	These 900000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and I shall therefore act according to my	39.35726547241211
18861/28840	Having said this Villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he	50.255104064941406
18862/28840	The same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to	135.09486389160156
18863/28840	and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them	20.706817626953125
18864/28840	Madame de Villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the	71.27045440673828
18865/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you	39.977195739746094
18866/28840	de Villefort Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime   Villefort tried to	37.49431610107422
18867/28840	No count he replied I am the only victim in this	94.6535415649414
18868/28840	It is I who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against	90.10310363769531
18869/28840	To what do you refer said Monte Cristo with wellfeigned	24.417343139648438
18870/28840	Have you really met with some great misfortune   Oh no monsieur said Villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which I have sustainednothing worth mentioning I assure	25.740753173828125
18871/28840	True said Monte Cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic	44.47407913208008
18872/28840	30183m       What do you say said the count 900000 francs It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a	19.550973892211914
18873/28840	And who is the cause of all this annoyance   My father as I told	29.544225692749023
18874/28840	Noirtier But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed   Yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner I have	82.0738525390625
18875/28840	I left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two not	82.77730560302734
18876/28840	But to do this he must have spoken   He has done better than thathe has made himself	63.40729904174805
18877/28840	How was such a thing possible   By the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal	75.9065933227539
18878/28840	My dear said Madame de Villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the	32.58134460449219
18879/28840	Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious	35.51826477050781
18880/28840	de Villefort has been telling me demanded Monte Cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune   Incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his	31.39443016052246
18881/28840	and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds water	73.1598892211914
18882/28840	My dear said Villefort in answer to his wife you know I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my	53.61150360107422
18883/28840	Nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained for so many	43.030147552490234
18884/28840	The Baron dÉpinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be	44.62928009033203
18885/28840	Do you think said Madame de Villefort that Valentine is in league with him She has always been opposed to this marriage and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between	47.70857620239258
18886/28840	Madame said Villefort believe me a fortune of 900000 francs is not so easily ren	25.27773666381836
18887/28840	She could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a	132.5030517578125
18888/28840	Never mind replied Villefort I say that this marriage _shall_ be consumm	38.828521728515625
18889/28840	Notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said Madame de Villefort selecting a new point of	84.69119262695312
18890/28840	Monte Cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was	127.05890655517578
18891/28840	30185m       Madame replied Villefort I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral	37.895835876464844
18892/28840	The name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to	129.1562042236328
18893/28840	But under the present circumstances I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the	59.92966079711914
18894/28840	It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such cap	107.72366333007812
18895/28840	I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward	128.37353515625
18896/28840	Noirtier I will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but I shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his	74.81220245361328
18897/28840	Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz dÉpinay because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because I choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever I	63.95003128051758
18898/28840	What said the count the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this	48.5348014831543
18899/28840	Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry	9.451318740844727
18900/28840	le Baron Franz dÉpinay   Yes sir that is the reason said Villefort shrugging his	9.250143051147461
18901/28840	The apparent reason at least said Madame de Ville	21.995817184448242
18902/28840	The _real_ reason madame I can assure you I know my	62.160499572753906
18903/28840	But I want to know in what way	79.10289764404297
18904/28840	dÉpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person   I believe I know	41.8676643371582
18905/28840	Franz dÉpinay said the count is he not the son of General de Quesnel who was created Baron dÉpinay by Charles	31.52622413635254
18906/28840	Well but he is a charming young man according to my	36.728214263916016
18907/28840	He is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of	57.327335357666016
18908/28840	Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying old men are always so selfish in their affection said Madame de Ville	75.85912322998047
18909/28840	Was not your father a Bonapartist asked Monte Cristo I think I remember that you told me something of that	38.298099517822266
18910/28840	My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else said Villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which Napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing	80.30813598632812
18911/28840	When my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the Bourbons for	49.34388732910156
18912/28840	Well said Monte Cristo it is just as I thought it was politics which brought Noirtier and	44.008392333984375
18913/28840	Am I mistaken then said Monte Crist	70.90277862548828
18914/28840	No sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said Madame de Villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that	39.6337890625
18915/28840	de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate	97.78645324707031
18916/28840	It was a sublime and charitable thought said Monte Cristo and the whole world should applaud	83.26016998291016
18917/28840	It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz dÉpin	17.215648651123047
18918/28840	Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just	20.261123657226562
18919/28840	But the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of	100.10157012939453
18920/28840	Although said Villefort it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune I do not think that	27.486263275146484
18921/28840	dÉpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary	102.1244888305664
18922/28840	He will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with	93.34092712402344
18923/28840	Besides he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of	71.26984405517578
18924/28840	and Madame de SaintMéran her mothers parents who both love her tender	39.809356689453125
18925/28840	And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as	165.59219360351562
18926/28840	Noirtier said Madame de Villefort besides they are to come to Paris in about a month and Valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with	66.82714080810547
18927/28840	The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded selflove and defeated	225.0379180908203
18928/28840	But it seems to me said Monte Cristo and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say that if	21.284866333007812
18929/28840	Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear	27.24208641052246
18930/28840	True said Madame de Villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjustshamefully unjust Poor Edward is as much	43.03593063354492
18931/28840	Noirtiers grandchild as Valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry	51.1661376953125
18932/28840	Noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than	37.98754119873047
18933/28840	The count listened and said no	226.32894897460938
18934/28840	Count said Villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortun	28.575960159301758
18935/28840	It is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and	40.149078369140625
18936/28840	dÉpinay to whom I had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if I endure the most cruel priv	48.899757385253906
18937/28840	However said Madame de Villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to	48.42464828491211
18938/28840	dÉpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Ville	16.797645568847656
18939/28840	Ah that would be a great pity said Ville	31.911895751953125
18940/28840	Undoubtedly said Villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which I was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain	87.54681396484375
18941/28840	No it will all go well	601.3124389648438
18942/28840	dÉpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is	33.2672233581543
18943/28840	de Villefort said Monte Cristo fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice I would persuade him since I have been told	26.493175506591797
18944/28840	dÉpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of	81.32691955566406
18945/28840	I will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on	67.45682525634766
18946/28840	The procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed	343.87335205078125
18947/28840	Well that is all that I wanted and I will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to Monte Crist	30.196292877197266
18948/28840	Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original	90.69178009033203
18949/28840	Sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and	84.9744644165039
18950/28840	dÉpinay even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a	41.29338073730469
18951/28840	At the conclusion of these words the count rose to	80.08710479736328
18952/28840	Are you going to leave us count said Madame de Ville	12.115534782409668
18953/28840	I am sorry to say I must do so madame I only came to remind you of your promise for	42.701534271240234
18954/28840	Did you fear that we should forget it   You are very good madame but	28.936954498291016

18956/28840	My husband has given me his word sir said Madame de Villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to	50.39386749267578
18957/28840	And said Villefort is it at your house in the ChampsÉlysées that you receive your visitors   No said Monte Cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritoriousit is in the	22.08716583251953
18958/28840	Where is it then Near Paris is it not   Very near only half a league from the Barriersit is at Auteu	43.00503921508789
18959/28840	At Auteuil said Villefort true Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil since it was to your house that she was	23.759010314941406
18960/28840	And in what part of Auteuil do you reside   Rue de la Font	22.913862228393555
18961/28840	Rue de la Fontaine exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone at what number  	29.537796020507812
18962/28840	Then cried Villefort was it you who bought	99.58734893798828
18963/28840	de SaintMérans house   Did it belong to	40.78330993652344
18964/28840	Yes replied Madame de Villefort and would you believe it count   Believe what   You think this house pretty do you not   I think it	34.66702651977539
18965/28840	Well my husband would never live in	190.27716064453125
18966/28840	Indeed returned Monte Cristo that is a prejudice on your part	43.817195892333984
18967/28840	de Villefort for which I am quite at a loss to	65.79362487792969
18968/28840	I do not like Auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear	46.791358947753906
18969/28840	But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said Monte Crist	23.330163955688477
18970/28840	No countI hopeI assure you I shall do my best stammered Ville	48.617488861083984
18971/28840	Oh said Monte Cristo I allow of no	55.15093231201172
18972/28840	I shall be expecting you and if you fail to come I shall thinkfor how do I know to the contrarythat this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with	55.976497650146484
18973/28840	I will come countI will be sure to come said Villefort	52.2763671875
18974/28840	Thank you said Monte Cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of	31.548429489135742
18975/28840	You said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said Madame de Villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other	29.791217803955078
18976/28840	Indeed madame said Monte Cristo I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am	18.782995223999023
18977/28840	Well then it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for hours	115.57910919189453
18978/28840	What is it   A te	17.856504440307617
18979/28840	So now I have told my	92.48920440673828
18980/28840	I began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own	71.0171127319336
18981/28840	Now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrig	124.27517700195312
18982/28840	At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insectactors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of	127.0392074584961
18983/28840	30191m       And are you going there   I	8.1021728515625
18984/28840	_Ma foi_ I should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I had formed of my fellowcreat	38.151798248291016
18985/28840	I shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where I shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to	66.24688720703125
18986/28840	You are a singular man said Ville	19.78356170654297
18987/28840	What line would you advise me to study   The one that is most in use just at this	78.73970031738281
18988/28840	The Spanish one you mean I suppose   Yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you   No said Monte Cristo since as I told you before I do not wish to comprehend	30.887285232543945
18989/28840	The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from	56.650779724121094
18990/28840	Montalivet transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne mystified by two Greek words _têle_ _graphein	71.48123168945312

18992/28840	Go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see	33.26012420654297

18998/28840	Leaving the village of Linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of Montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that	83.95638275146484
18999/28840	At the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white	72.88658905029297
19000/28840	Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and	101.04180145263672
19001/28840	The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of Delacroix our modern Rub	113.07062530517578
19002/28840	This path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only	115.04893493652344
19003/28840	Never had Flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little	179.70327758789062
19004/28840	In fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the _parterre_ not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp	82.6359634399414
19005/28840	Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look	54.68157196044922
19006/28840	The man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to	88.61947631835938
19007/28840	Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape	78.1126480102539
19008/28840	He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his	201.18885803222656
19009/28840	You are gathering your crop sir said Monte Cristo	35.97121810913086
19010/28840	30193m       Excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap I am not up there I know but I have only just come	21.649681091308594
19011/28840	Do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any	96.40133666992188
19012/28840	I have ten left said the man for here are eleven and I had twentyone five more than last	133.0774383544922
19013/28840	But I am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat	216.3456268310547
19014/28840	This is the reason that instead of the sixteen I had last year I have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen	193.3307342529297
19015/28840	Ah I miss three they were here last night sirI am sure they were hereI counted	188.67897033691406
19016/28840	It must be the son of Mère Simon who has stolen them I saw him strolling about here this	81.71431732177734
19017/28840	Ah the young rascalstealing in a gardenhe does not know where that may lead him	59.913089752197266
19018/28840	Certainly it is wrong said Monte Cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the	61.70927047729492
19019/28840	Of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less	77.69954681396484
19020/28840	But sir once more I beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that I am detaining	121.03400421142578
19021/28840	And he glanced timidly at the counts blue	82.4973373413086
19022/28840	Ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy	60.26163864135742
19023/28840	What Did the Romans eat them said the gardenerate dormice   I have read so in Petronius said the	85.97731018066406
19024/28840	Really They cant be nice though they do say as fat as a dorm	322.091796875
19025/28840	It is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all	254.6481170654297

19032/28840	Did you come here sir to see the telegraph he	54.177978515625
19033/28840	Yes if it isnt contrary to the	81.54145812988281
19034/28840	Oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are	56.382957458496094
19035/28840	I have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you	74.00293731689453
19036/28840	That is true sir and that is what I like best said the man	55.63421630859375
19037/28840	Why do you like that best   Because then I have no	53.029903411865234
19038/28840	I am a machine then and nothing else and so long as I work nothing more is required of	97.75703430175781
19039/28840	Is it possible said Monte Cristo to himself that I can have met with a man that has no ambition That would spoil my	59.406944274902344
19040/28840	Sir said the gardener glancing at the sundial the ten minutes are almost up I must return to my	77.60572052001953
19041/28840	Will you go up with me   I follow	39.321014404296875
19042/28840	Monte Cristo entered the tower which was divided into three	96.59579467773438
19043/28840	The tower contained implements such as spades rakes wateringpots hung against the wall this was all the	109.84638214111328
19044/28840	Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked Monte Crist	110.89326477050781
19045/28840	The study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so	58.86172103881836
19046/28840	And what is the pay   A thousand francs	40.6549186706543
19047/28840	No but then we are lodged as you	86.4978256225586
19048/28840	They passed to the third story it was the telegraph	118.52388763427734
19049/28840	Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was	114.7975082397461
19050/28840	It is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a	57.658973693847656
19051/28840	At first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year I became used to it and then we have our hours of recreation and our	71.80854797363281
19052/28840	When   When we have a	65.98876953125
19053/28840	Those are indeed holidays to me I go into the garden I plant I prune I trim I kill the insects all day	158.8686981201172
19054/28840	How long have you been here   Ten years and five as a supernumerary make	77.04035186767578
19055/28840	You are   Fiftyfive years	32.130271911621094
19056/28840	How long must you have served to claim the pension   Oh sir twentyfive	72.8046875
19057/28840	And how much is the pension   A hundred crown	39.454681396484375
19058/28840	What did you say sir asked the	34.646446228027344
19059/28840	I was saying it was very	73.70929718017578
19060/28840	What was   All you were showing	78.84915161132812
19061/28840	And you really understand none of these signals   None at	83.78070068359375
19062/28840	And have you never tried to understand them  	63.52796173095703
19063/28840	Why should I   But still there are some signals only addressed to	99.80159759521484
19064/28840	And do you understand them   They are always the	33.126548767089844
19065/28840	And they mean   _Nothing new You have an hour_ or _Tomorrow	148.14837646484375
19066/28840	This is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion   Ah yes thank you	69.75252532958984
19067/28840	And what is it sayinganything you understand   Yes it asks if I am	42.57862091064453
19068/28840	And you reply   By the same sign which at the same time tells my righthand correspondent that I am ready while it gives notice to my lefthand correspondent to prepare in his	68.47237396240234
19069/28840	It is very ingenious said the	47.62922286987305
19070/28840	You will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will	59.87610626220703
19071/28840	I have then five minutes said Monte Cristo to himself it is more time than I	34.13563537597656
19072/28840	My dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question   What is it sir   You are fond of gardening   Passion	23.99056053161621
19073/28840	And you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres   Sir I should make a terrestrial paradise of	64.15589141845703
19074/28840	You live badly on your thousand francs   Badly enough but yet I do	107.69680786132812
19075/28840	Yes but you have a wretchedly small	147.8542938232422
19076/28840	And then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat	110.7884521484375
19077/28840	Tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand correspondent was telegraphing   I should not see	33.22367477416992
19078/28840	Then what would happen   I could not repeat the	78.67169952392578
19079/28840	And then   Not having repeated them through negligence I should be	137.7702178955078
19080/28840	How much   A hundred franc	33.0604362487793
19081/28840	The tenth of your incomethat would be fine	200.3882598876953
19082/28840	Has it ever happened to you said Monte Crist	42.002655029296875
19083/28840	Once sir when I was grafting a roset	62.53014373779297
19084/28840	Well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another   Ah that is another case I should be turned off and lose my	96.4969482421875
19085/28840	Three hundred francs   A hundred crowns yes sir so you see that I am not likely to do any of these	36.55621337890625
19086/28840	Not even for fifteen years wages Come it is worth thinking about   For fifteen thousand francs  	55.72703170776367
19087/28840	Sir you are tempting me   Just so fifteen thousand francs do you understand   Sir let me see my righthand	20.66725730895996
19088/28840	On the contrary do not look at him but at	50.31492614746094
19089/28840	What is it   What Do you not know these bits of paper   Banknotes   Exactly there are fifteen of	39.67243576049805
19090/28840	And whose are they   Yours if you	131.73899841308594
19091/28840	Sir you have distracted me I shall be	45.383445739746094
19092/28840	That will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my bank	44.92033767700195
19093/28840	Sir my righthand correspondent redoubles his signals he is	55.17405319213867
19094/28840	Never mindtake these and the count placed the packet in the mans	187.18048095703125
19095/28840	Now this is not all he said you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand franc	71.23844909667969
19096/28840	No you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents	64.56658172607422
19097/28840	Oh sir what are you proposing   A j	35.50945281982422
19098/28840	Sir unless you force me   I think I can effectually force you and Monte Cristo drew another packet from his	43.553245544433594
19099/28840	Here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twentyfive	104.54082489013672
19100/28840	With five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a	70.55476379394531
19101/28840	A garden with two acres of land   And a thousand francs a	38.83973693847656
19102/28840	Oh heavens   Come take them and Monte Cristo forced the banknotes into his	50.73076629638672
19103/28840	What am I to do   Nothing very	60.30683135986328
19104/28840	But what is it   To repeat these	49.6898078918457
19105/28840	Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be	73.43881225585938
19106/28840	There you see it will not take	125.44097137451172
19107/28840	Yes but   Do this and you will have nectarines and all the	60.20063781738281
19108/28840	As to the lefthand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the Minister of the	65.00627136230469
19109/28840	Now you are rich said Monte Crist	36.596370697021484

19126/28840	Those who had kept their shares or bought those of Danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad	85.08523559570312
19127/28840	Next morning _Le Moniteur_ contained the following   It was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of	61.80556869506836

19135/28840	It is told that the Duc dAntin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed Louis	68.5567626953125
19136/28840	For the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving	57.61664962768555
19137/28840	Thus the house had become unrecognizable and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of	45.81222152709961

19142/28840	At five oclock precisely the count arrived before the house at Auteuil followed by	24.4062557220459

19160/28840	And at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before	102.70773315429688
19161/28840	The carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horse	62.395782470703125
19162/28840	The instant Debray had touched the ground he was at the carriaged	35.90823745727539

19164/28840	But nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the ministers	54.74706268310547

19267/28840	Exactly one comes from the Volga and the other from Lake Fus	38.131656646728516
19268/28840	Well this is just what amuses me said Monte Crist	39.35414123535156
19269/28840	I am like Nero_cupitor impossibilium_ and that is what is amusing you at this	72.64340209960938
19270/28840	This fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it	101.94354248046875
19271/28840	But how could you have these fish brought to France   Oh nothing more	47.77754211425781
19272/28840	Danglars   I cannot help doubting answered Danglars with his stupid	13.658408164978027
19273/28840	Baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet	79.04803466796875
19274/28840	Danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their	44.40564727783203
19275/28840	Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the	85.21118927001953
19276/28840	But why have two of each sort asked Dangl	66.80223083496094
19277/28840	Merely because one might have died carelessly answered Monte Crist	91.68892669677734
19278/28840	You are certainly an extraordinary man said Danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be	39.06001663208008
19279/28840	And to have ideas added Madame Dangl	41.57442092895508
19280/28840	It was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the	117.14946746826172
19281/28840	Their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when	221.87705993652344
19282/28840	Yes said Debray but then Ostia is only a few leagues from	47.16847229003906
19283/28840	True said Monte Cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after Lucullus if we can do no better than he could   The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say	40.0150260925293
19284/28840	All this is very extraordinary said ChâteauRenaud still what I admire the most I confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are	41.43070983886719
19285/28840	Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago   Certainly not	78.9758071899414
19286/28840	Well I am sure it is quite transformed since last	120.51127624511719
19287/28840	If I remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years	95.61848449707031
19288/28840	Why not I am fond of grass and shade said Monte Crist	49.0760612487793
19289/28840	Yes said Madame de Villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road I	42.4896354675293
19290/28840	Yes madame said Monte Cristo but I preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my	28.67753791809082
19291/28840	In four days said Morrel it is extraordinary   Indeed said ChâteauRenaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull	46.3068962097168
19292/28840	I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when	73.71393585205078
19293/28840	de SaintMéran advertised it for sale two or three years	26.295429229736328
19294/28840	de SaintMéran said Madame de Villefort then this house belonged to	24.133455276489258
19295/28840	de SaintMéran before you bought it   It appears so replied Monte Crist	18.62847328186035
19296/28840	Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it   Quite so my steward transacts all this business for	42.67898941040039
19297/28840	It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said ChâteauRenaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the	46.562644958496094
19298/28840	Really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been	49.13340377807617
19299/28840	Villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it	65.86767578125
19300/28840	Perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the not	36.6275520324707
19301/28840	It is probable stammered out Villefort trying to smile but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such	35.2048454284668
19302/28840	This house is part of Valentines marriageportion and	84.61756896972656
19303/28840	de SaintMéran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to	35.619693756103516
19304/28840	It was Morrels turn to become	135.80870056152344
19305/28840	There was above all one room continued Monte Cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which I know not why appeared to me quite	102.6726303100586
19306/28840	Why so said Danglars why dramatic   Can we account for instinct said Monte Crist	43.138404846191406
19307/28840	Are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we cannot	223.49862670898438
19308/28840	It is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to other placeswhich very likely have no connection with the present time and	174.52249145507812
19309/28840	And there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdem	26.752395629882812
19310/28840	Stay since we have finished dinner I will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the	47.78742980957031
19311/28840	Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his	36.87403869628906
19312/28840	Madame de Villefort rose Monte Cristo did the same and the rest followed their	60.8582649230957
19313/28840	Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid	29.710519790649414
19314/28840	We must go replied Villefort offering his	44.9051628112793
19315/28840	Each one went out by the open	80.26897430419922
19316/28840	Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to	61.102577209472656
19317/28840	They began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of	103.95410919189453
19318/28840	The drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from China of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful	124.26801300048828
19319/28840	At length they arrived at the famous	84.19845581054688
19320/28840	There was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was oldfashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecor	82.49658966064453
19321/28840	These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy	165.03692626953125
19322/28840	cried Madame de Villefort it is really fright	31.671241760253906
19323/28840	Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words but was not	41.1341552734375
19324/28840	Many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the	108.66100311279297
19325/28840	30221m       Is it not so asked Monte Crist	11.906286239624023
19326/28840	Oh said Madame de Villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed   Madame Danglars rose	33.747928619384766
19327/28840	And then said Monte Cristo this is not	26.228609085083008
19328/28840	What is there more said Debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of Madame Dangl	18.501251220703125
19329/28840	Ah what else is there said Danglars for at present I cannot say that I have seen anything	40.945655822753906
19330/28840	Cavalcanti   Ah said he we have at Pisa Ugolinos tower at Ferrara Tassos prison at Rimini the room of Francesca and Pa	108.19954681396484
19331/28840	Yes but you have not this little staircase said Monte Cristo opening a door concealed by the draper	40.871978759765625
19332/28840	Look at it and tell me what you think of	34.148250579833984
19333/28840	What a wickedlooking crooked staircase said ChâteauRenaud with a	22.902124404907227
19334/28840	I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said Debr	74.544921875
19335/28840	Ever since Valentines dowry had been mentioned Morrel had been silent and	72.84642028808594
19336/28840	Ah madame cried Debray what is the matter with you how pale you look   It is very evident what is the matter with her said Madame de Villefort	18.147981643676758
19337/28840	de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to	132.28305053710938
19338/28840	Yes said Villefort really count you frighten the	61.98518371582031
19339/28840	What is the matter asked Debray in a whisper of Madame Dangl	11.123945236206055
19340/28840	Nothing she replied with a violent	49.20435333251953
19341/28840	Will you come into the garden said Debray advancing towards the back	49.83190155029297
19342/28840	No no she answered I would rather remain	123.15446472167969
19343/28840	Are you really frightened madame said Monte Crist	18.170806884765625
19344/28840	Oh no sir said Madame Danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of	46.78034210205078
19345/28840	30223m       Ah yes said Monte Cristo smiling it is all a matter of	16.299867630004883
19346/28840	Madame Danglars is ill said Villefort it would be better to take her to her	27.452301025390625
19347/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo taking it from her	21.056108474731445
19348/28840	Yes she said at your advice I have made the	64.3681869506836
19349/28840	And have you succeeded   I think	38.508365631103516
19350/28840	Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to	35.881160736083984
19351/28840	Ah she cried what a frightful dream   Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a	27.00954246520996
19352/28840	Danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with Major Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to	36.9968147277832
19353/28840	He took the arm of Madame Danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalc	20.349857330322266
19354/28840	Really madame he said did I alarm you much   Oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our	70.40117645263672
19355/28840	And then you know he said an idea a supposition is	113.07913208007812
19356/28840	Well said Monte Cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this	24.8377742767334
19357/28840	Take care said Madame de Villefort the kings attorney is	26.273433685302734
19358/28840	Ah replied Monte Cristo since that is the case I will take advantage of his presence to make my	26.9789981842041
19359/28840	Oh this is very interesting said Debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate	44.064910888671875
19360/28840	There has been a crime said Monte Crist	26.57154655456543
19361/28840	Villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent	86.81690979003906
19362/28840	He then took Villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of Madame Danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantaintree where the shade was thick	36.49690246582031
19363/28840	30225m       Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen while that of Villefort tremb	14.813727378845215
19364/28840	This house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a	144.2238311767578
19365/28840	Who said it was a crime asked Villefort with a last	38.1017951965332
19366/28840	How is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried Monte Crist	66.40574645996094
19367/28840	And pray what do you call such an action   But who said it was buried alive   Why bury it there if it were dead This garden has never been a	74.55889129638672
19368/28840	What is done to infanticides in this country asked Major Cavalcanti innoc	47.22510528564453
19369/28840	Oh their heads are soon cut off said Dangl	56.421417236328125
19370/28840	I think so am I not right	66.32837677001953
19371/28840	Yes count replied Villefort in a voice now scarcely	56.854286193847656
19372/28840	Indeed count said Madame Danglars I am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that I must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a	37.80089569091797
19373/28840	Monte Cristo bowed and went to Madame de Ville	17.670469284057617
19374/28840	I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle he	40.877296447753906
19375/28840	But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars I must speak to	19.50517463684082
19376/28840	Where   In my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest	84.722412109375
19377/28840	At this moment Madame de Villefort	20.769962310791016
19378/28840	Thanks my dear friend said Madame Danglars trying to smile it is over now and I am much	24.122114181518555
19379/28840	The Beggar   The evening passed on Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris which Madame Danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she	36.71226119995117
19380/28840	de Villefort was the first to give the signal of	41.38642120361328
19381/28840	He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars that she might be under the care of his	39.03187561035156
19382/28840	Danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with	33.007911682128906
19383/28840	Cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was	265.71661376953125
19384/28840	Without opposing their arrangements he allowed Morrel ChâteauRenaud and Debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in	48.238834381103516
19385/28840	Danglars more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his	24.383113861083984
19386/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the English fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray	70.86830139160156
19387/28840	Andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings	195.45013427734375
19388/28840	He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his banknotes had immediately converted them into an available	75.76107788085938
19389/28840	One thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of Danglars for Cavalc	60.664466857910156
19390/28840	The latter faithful to the principle of Horace _nil admirari_ had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were	128.3760986328125
19391/28840	Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words   Tomorrow sir I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on	59.862117767333984
19392/28840	And I sir said Danglars shall be most happy to receive	34.657447814941406
19393/28840	Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel des Princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his	20.86280059814453
19394/28840	To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave	55.02140808105469
19395/28840	As for Andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach	74.69602966308594
19396/28840	The groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to Andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the	141.08387756347656
19397/28840	At that moment a hand touched his	232.07708740234375
19398/28840	The young man turned round thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were	50.498069763183594
19399/28840	What do you want of me he	23.90658187866211
19400/28840	Pardon me my friend if I disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but I want to speak to	24.339632034301758
19401/28840	You have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome	63.393943786621094
19402/28840	Come said Andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want Speak quickly	136.5417938232422
19403/28840	The man said in a low voice I wishI wish you to spare me the walk back to	63.200111389160156
19404/28840	I am very tired and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you I can scarcely	63.376014709472656
19405/28840	The young man shuddered at this strange	34.36666488647461
19406/28840	Tell me he saidtell me what you want   Well then I want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me	45.159847259521484
19407/28840	Let me at least reach a shady spot said	158.54917907714844
19408/28840	Oh as for that Ill take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horses bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon	74.95066833496094
19409/28840	Dont think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no its only because I am tired and also because I have a little business to talk over with	89.14059448242188
19410/28840	Come step in said the young	81.05877685546875
19411/28840	It was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the til	83.07240295410156
19412/28840	Andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though wellpleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a	131.45692443847656
19413/28840	How does that annoy you   It does not on the contrary I think it will answer my	38.19687271118164
19414/28840	So said Andrea you are speculating upon me   What fine words he uses   I warn you Master Caderousse that you are	31.59687614440918
19415/28840	Well well dont be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us	66.80382537841797

19426/28840	You are lucky I wish I could say as much for I do conceal myself and then I was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added Caderousse with his unpleasant	50.78538131713867

19431/28840	Oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said Andrea becoming more and more	109.72189331054688
19432/28840	If I had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and wornout shoes on my feet you would not have known	57.23108673095703

19436/28840	What an appetite you used to have Is it as good now   Oh yes replied Andrea	57.82218933105469
19437/28840	How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left   He is not a prince simply a	54.42325973510742
19438/28840	A count and a rich one too eh   Yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very goodtempered	38.26282501220703

19449/28840	What is his name   Major Cavalc	11.676382064819336
19450/28840	Is he pleased with you   So far I have appeared to answer his	89.18365478515625
19451/28840	And who found this father for you   The Count of Monte Crist	28.888031005859375

19454/28840	Meanwhile what are you going to do   I   Yes	16.03416633605957
19455/28840	It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about	85.53519439697266
19456/28840	Since you interest yourself in my affairs I think it is now my turn to ask you some	57.095943450927734
19457/28840	Well I shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a	125.09076690673828
19458/28840	Then in the evening I shall go to the theatre I shall look like some retired	55.534236907958984
19459/28840	Come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be	164.54290771484375
19460/28840	Bossuet And youwhat will you become A peer of France   Ah said Andrea who knows   Major Cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is	73.1634521484375
19461/28840	And now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and	61.807186126708984
19462/28840	Then to justify myself I should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the	74.92243957519531

19464/28840	Certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful	63.4578742980957
19465/28840	He drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a	51.72673797607422
19466/28840	But meanwhile Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long Spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of	54.42067337036133
19467/28840	The two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one	168.54600524902344

19469/28840	Good Caderousse he said how happy you will	37.004295349121094
19470/28840	I will do my best said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard shutting up his	39.50682067871094
19471/28840	Well then we will go into	68.81822967529297
19472/28840	But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on	74.3202133178711
19473/28840	But tell me said Andrea am I to remain bareheaded   Pooh said Caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown	72.61582946777344
19474/28840	Come come enough of this said Cavalc	117.77285766601562
19475/28840	What are you waiting for said Cader	21.691421508789062
19476/28840	I hope I am not the	30.235877990722656
19477/28840	At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse and Caderousse leaped	83.67992401123047

19482/28840	When he reached the wicket of the Louvre he turned to the left galloped across the Carrousel passed through the Rue SaintRoch and issuing from the Rue de la Michodière he arrived at	37.3014030456543
19483/28840	Danglars door just at the same time that Villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg SaintHonoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own	18.81405258178711
19484/28840	No Hermine replied Debray you cannot make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the	31.84018325805664
19485/28840	Danglars was disagreeable certainly but I know how much you care for his illhum	27.430740356445312
19486/28840	Someone has vexed you I will allow no one to annoy	73.43099975585938
19487/28840	You are deceived Lucien I assure you replied Madame Danglars and what I have told you is really the case added to the illhumor you remarked but which I did not think it worth while to allude	32.55233383178711
19488/28840	It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as Debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to	65.57081604003906
19489/28840	At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Cornélie her confidential	28.016016006469727
19490/28840	What is my daughter doing asked Madame Dangl	22.447460174560547
19491/28840	She practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied Mademoiselle Corné	31.779388427734375
19492/28840	Yet I think I hear her	175.58583068847656
19493/28840	It is Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who is playing while Mademoiselle Danglars is in	11.48660945892334
19494/28840	Well said Madame Danglars come and undress	20.13827896118164
19495/28840	Debray stretched himself upon a large couch and Madame Danglars passed into her dressingroom with Mademoiselle Corné	21.241540908813477
19496/28840	Lucien said Madame Danglars through the door you are always complaining that Eugénie will not address a word to	28.220670700073242
19497/28840	True said Madame Danglars yet I think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your	61.0640754699707
19498/28840	My study   At least that of the	46.82698059082031
19499/28840	Why so   To ask for an engagement at the	61.53593063354492
19500/28840	Really I never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of	97.70386505126953
19501/28840	Well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as	73.10374450683594
19502/28840	Go Cornélie said Madame Danglars I do not require you any	23.993247985839844
19503/28840	Cornélie obeyed and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to Debr	38.41056823730469
19504/28840	Then she began thoughtfully to caress the little sp	141.85452270507812
19505/28840	Lucien looked at her for a moment in	41.8685417175293
19506/28840	Come Hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it not so   30239m       Nothing answered the baron	22.86648941040039
19507/28840	And yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking	94.83018493652344
19508/28840	Debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened	66.37513732910156
19509/28840	At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to	25.97366714477539
19510/28840	Goodevening madame said the banker goodevening	95.39301300048828
19511/28840	Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the	57.28842544555664
19512/28840	Assuming a dignified air she turned round to Debray without answering her	54.61697769165039
19513/28840	Debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with	32.887550354003906
19514/28840	Excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and	96.73467254638672
19515/28840	Debray was petrified not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to	68.88468170166016
19516/28840	The baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock	50.406219482421875
19517/28840	The result was that the proud look entirely failed of its	284.215576171875
19518/28840	Lucien said the baroness I assure you I have no desire to sleep and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing	38.773406982421875
19519/28840	I am at your service madame replied Lucien cold	14.617009162902832
19520/28840	Do not think I wish to turn you out my dear Debray continued Danglars oh no not at	45.65892028808594
19521/28840	An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely I make such a request I am sure you cannot grudge it to	76.944091796875
19522/28840	Debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like Nathan in _Athalie	93.45903778076172
19523/28840	It is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over	139.4056396484375
19524/28840	The animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motion	60.40618133544922
19525/28840	Do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving Generally you are only rude but tonight you are	37.21027755737305
19526/28840	It is because I am in a worse humor than usual replied Dangl	31.616979598999023
19527/28840	Hermine looked at the banker with supreme	249.50257873535156
19528/28840	These glances frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars but this evening he took no notice of	44.28647232055664
19529/28840	Not so replied Danglars your advice is wrong so I shall not follow	58.208404541015625
19530/28840	My money boxes are my Pactolus as I think	192.5931854248047
19531/28840	Demoustier says and I will not retard its course or disturb its	208.84408569335938
19532/28840	And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune Explain yourself more clearly I beg	148.00009155273438
19533/28840	Oh make yourself easyI am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what I	49.39656066894531
19534/28840	The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700000 francs in the course of an	38.715885162353516
19535/28840	I do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her	27.496017456054688
19536/28840	You understand me perfectly on the contrary said Danglars but if you will persist I will tell you that I have just lost 700000 francs upon the Spanish	22.46748924255371
19537/28840	And pray asked the baroness am I responsible for this loss   Why not   Is it my fault you have lost 700000 francs   Certainly it is not	22.8476619720459
19538/28840	Once for all sir replied the baroness sharply I tell you I will not hear cash named it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first	61.412994384765625
19539/28840	Oh I can well believe that for neither of them was worth a	98.63788604736328
19540/28840	The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and recounted is odious to	127.92172241210938
19541/28840	I only know one thing I dislike more which is the sound of your	112.92487335205078
19542/28840	Well this surprises me for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs   30243m       I What could put such an idea into your head  	40.57770919799805
19543/28840	I should like to know upon what occasion   Oh _mon Dieu_ that is very easily	27.024572372436523
19544/28840	Last February you were the first who told me of the Haitian	98.46856689453125
19545/28840	You had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be	153.26673889160156
19546/28840	I know how clearsighted your dreams are I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt and I gained 400000 francs by it of which 100000 have been honestly paid to	89.68376159667969
19547/28840	You spent it as you pleased that was your	158.90679931640625
19548/28840	In March there was a question about a grant to a	112.55731964111328
19549/28840	Three companies presented themselves each offering equal	1042.9769287109375
19550/28840	I bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and I picked up a million from which 250000 francs were paid to you for pin	63.94268035888672
19551/28840	How have you spent this 250000 francsit is no business of	57.40655517578125
19552/28840	When are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impat	36.443504333496094
19553/28840	Patience madame I am coming to	94.71851348876953
19554/28840	In April you went to dine at the	134.34710693359375
19555/28840	You heard a private conversation respecting Spanish affairson the expulsion of Don	203.71966552734375
19556/28840	The expulsion took place and I pocketed 600000 francs the day Charles	207.76303100585938
19557/28840	Of these 600000 francs you took 50000 crown	49.751487731933594
19558/28840	They were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and I asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500000 liv	77.07460021972656
19559/28840	Well sir and what then   Ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled	81.0147705078125
19560/28840	Really your manner of speaking   It expresses my meaning and that is all I	53.208412170410156
19561/28840	Well three days after that you talked politics with	221.19223022460938
19562/28840	Debray and you fancied from his words that Don Carlos had returned to	54.452392578125
19563/28840	Well I sold my shares the news got out and I no longer soldI gave them away next day I find the news was false and by this false report I have lost 700000 franc	84.1131820678711
19564/28840	Well   Well since I gave you a fourth of my gains I think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700000 francs is 175000 franc	32.55585861206055
19565/28840	What you say is absurd and I cannot see why	90.27345275878906

19573/28840	Well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministers	185.6634521484375
19574/28840	You understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash	69.52751922607422

19582/28840	Besides how do I know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy I excite has not concerted with	92.3212890625

19584/28840	It was done on purpose for meI am sure of	65.17135620117188
19585/28840	Yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministers secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700000 franc	67.57433319091797
19586/28840	But sir said Hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by	97.24613189697266
19587/28840	Debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it Why to accuse the man do you address the woman   Do I know	53.806392669677734

19621/28840	Well I was a million in advance with him and now my fine Jacopo Manfredi suspends payment   Really   It is an unheardof fat	34.48714828491211
19622/28840	I draw upon him for 600000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that I hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400000 francs payable at his correspondents in Paris at the end of this	41.38544845581055
19623/28840	I present them but my correspondent has	149.4634552001953
19624/28840	This with my Spanish affairs made a pretty end to the	191.87379455566406
19625/28840	Then you really lost by that affair in Spain   Yes only 700000 francs out of my cash boxnothing more   Why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager   Oh it is all my wifes	53.21376037597656
19626/28840	She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to Spain she believes in	208.76315307617188
19627/28840	It is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures	191.7285614013672
19628/28840	On this conviction I allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and	232.12911987304688
19629/28840	It is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700000 francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it	80.56453704833984

19633/28840	But touching these Spanish affairs I think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos	64.0265884399414
19634/28840	Well thats what puzzles me replied Danglars the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by te	38.355228424072266
19635/28840	So that said Monte Cristo you have lost nearly 1700000 francs this	21.850187301635742
19636/28840	Not nearly indeed that is exactly my	346.2342529296875
19637/28840	_Diable_ said Monte Cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate	50.75868606567383
19638/28840	Thirdrate said Danglars rather humble what do you mean by that   Certainly continued Monte Cristo I make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate	49.4271240234375
19639/28840	I think this is about your position is it not   Confound it yes replied Dangl	21.945215225219727
19640/28840	The result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to	225.63961791992188
19641/28840	Oh said Danglars becoming very pale how you are running on   Let us imagine seven such months continued Monte Cristo in the same	37.062904357910156

19643/28840	I have made money at the same time by speculations which have	59.94801330566406

19646/28840	Very good very good But the wound remains and will reopen at the first	282.8349914550781
19647/28840	No for I am only embarked in certainties replied Danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to	54.39459228515625

19651/28840	I think I may aspire to that honor said Danglars with a smile which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of	46.21504211425781
19652/28840	But while we are speaking of business Danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what I am to do for	56.938819885253906
19653/28840	Give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems	162.83006286621094
19654/28840	Excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40000 francs payable at sight on you signed by Busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsementof course I immediately counted him over the forty bank	97.84513092041016
19655/28840	Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of ass	38.971649169921875

19657/28840	May I ask how much he allows the young man   Five thousand francs per	41.338748931884766
19658/28840	I thought I was right in believing that Cavalcanti to be a stingy	48.020904541015625
19659/28840	How can a young man live upon 5000 francs a month   But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more   Do not advance it the father will never repay	48.73491287231445

19664/28840	I was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just	72.93933868408203
19665/28840	And with all this how unassuming he is I should never have taken him for anything more than a mere	85.02472686767578

19670/28840	Yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared toler	390.3251037597656
19671/28840	Why   Because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told	62.02125549316406
19672/28840	He has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to Paris	76.5678482055664

19674/28840	It is usual certainly but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other	101.28530883789062
19675/28840	I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a	49.938636779785156
19676/28840	Do you think so   I am sure of	13.225822448730469
19677/28840	And you have heard his fortune mentioned   Nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a far	96.3039321899414
19678/28840	And what is your opinion   I ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal	47.397674560546875
19679/28840	Certainly said Danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of	73.8011245727539
19680/28840	Very little at least I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in Lu	100.8331069946289
19681/28840	Ah he has a palace said Danglars laughing come that is	44.19419860839844

19694/28840	But he is betrothed to your daughter I believe   Well	38.788055419921875
19695/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more	27.497610092163086
19696/28840	Oh I do not mean her fortune only but tell me   What   Why did you not invite	37.70909881591797
19697/28840	and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner   I did so but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea	34.41924285888672
19698/28840	Yes yes said Danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of	31.516672134399414
19699/28840	Why so   Because it is the air she always breathed in her	90.50735473632812
19700/28840	Monte Cristo took no notice of this illnatured	77.98209381103516

19702/28840	And for this very reason said Danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic I prefer	44.25922393798828
19703/28840	Still I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti   The MorcerfsStay my dear count said Danglars you are a man of the world are you not   I think	19.75228500366211

19714/28840	Well when I was a clerk Morcerf was a mere	74.09092712402344
19715/28840	And then he was called  	86.71351623535156
19716/28840	You are sure   _Pardieu_ I have bought enough fish of him to know his	40.55183029174805
19717/28840	What   Oh nothing   Ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of Fernand Mondeg	29.462488174438477
19718/28840	I have heard that name in	66.55835723876953

19720/28840	I acknowledge I would have given anything to find it	47.667606353759766
19721/28840	It would be very easy if you much wished it   How so   Probably you have some correspondent in Greece   I should think	46.4976921081543
19722/28840	Well write to your correspondent in Yanina and ask him what part was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali Tepel	39.24446105957031
19723/28840	You are right exclaimed Danglars rising quickly I will write	46.48041534423828
19724/28840	30259m       And if you should hear of anything very scandalous   I will communicate it to	25.125347137451172
19725/28840	Danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his _coupé	17.266582489013672
19726/28840	The Office of the Kings Attorney   Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed and follow Madame Danglars in her morning exc	58.53614807128906
19727/28840	We have said that at halfpast twelve oclock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the	24.63867950439453
19728/28840	She directed her course towards the Faubourg Saint Germain went down the Rue Mazarine and stopped at the Passage du PontNe	33.87834167480469
19729/28840	She descended and went through the	71.27279663085938
19730/28840	She was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the	100.93355560302734
19731/28840	At the Rue Guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Har	57.87721633911133
19732/28840	As soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bon	51.39784240722656
19733/28840	She then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocketmirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone	66.27459716796875
19734/28840	The cab crossed the PontNeuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des PasPerd	32.95949172973633
19735/28840	There was a great deal going on that morning and many businesslike persons at the Palais businesslike persons pay very little attention to women and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her	75.98956298828125
19736/28840	There was a great press of people in	98.09954833984375
19737/28840	de Villeforts antechamber but Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her	22.645734786987305
19738/28840	The instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to	88.25592041015625
19739/28840	Nevertheless sir you see I have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for	117.09099578857422
19740/28840	Sir said Madame Danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not Spare me then I beseech	33.57107925415039
19741/28840	And I he said I feel that my place is not in the judges seat but on the prisoners	111.01092529296875
19742/28840	30263m       You said Madame Dangl	8.292991638183594
19743/28840	I think sir you exaggerate your situation said Madame Danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a	24.983461380004883
19744/28840	The paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imag	110.06753540039062
19745/28840	Besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this the world excuses and notoriety ennobles	93.1761703491211
19746/28840	Madame replied Villefort you know that I am no hypocrite or at least that I never deceive without a	36.89891815185547
19747/28840	If my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has	89.04788970947266
19748/28840	I was not so in my youth I was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marse	38.53922653198242
19749/28840	But since then everything has changed in and about me I am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my	90.97474670410156
19750/28840	It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch	89.48350524902344
19751/28840	Thus the greater number of a mans errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped	120.93997192382812
19752/28840	In any case sir you will allow replied Madame Danglars that even if the fault were alone mine I last night received a severe punishment for	98.70018005371094
19753/28840	Poor thing said Villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet   Well   Well I must tell	41.410152435302734
19754/28840	Collect all your courage for you have not yet heard	69.63212585449219
19755/28840	Ah exclaimed Madame Danglars alarmed what is there more to hear   You only look back to the past and it is indeed bad	41.0448112487793
19756/28840	Chance replied Villefort No no madame there is no such thing as	32.884071350097656
19757/28840	Ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the	146.535888671875
19758/28840	Well no madamethis is the terrible news I have to tell you said Villefort in a hollow voiceno nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterred	59.31769561767578
19759/28840	You must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble   What can you mean asked Madame Danglars shudder	32.961700439453125
19760/28840	de Monte Cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there   Neither of them there repeated Madame Danglars her staring wideopen eyes expressing her	91.44097900390625
19761/28840	Neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped	110.9362564086914
19762/28840	Oh you frighten me But speak I will	140.9877166748047

19765/28840	Madame Danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but Villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her	33.42751693725586
19766/28840	We thought it dead he repeated I placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin I descended to the garden I dug a hole and then flung it down in	80.52025604248047
19767/28840	Scarcely had I covered it with earth when the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me I saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of	60.54505920410156
19768/28840	I felt pain I wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice I fell lifeless and fancied myself	115.17221069335938
19769/28840	Never shall I forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness I dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet	112.39695739746094
19770/28840	We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful	200.72412109375

19772/28840	A duel was the pretext for my	432.3575744628906
19773/28840	Though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping	221.6005859375
19774/28840	I was taken to Versailles for three months I struggled with death at last as I seemed to cling to life I was ordered to the	69.3629379272461
19775/28840	Four men carried me from Paris to Châlons walking six leagues a day Madame de Villefort followed the litter in her	71.66272735595703
19776/28840	At Châlons I was put upon the Saône thence I passed on to the Rhône whence I descended merely with the current to Arles at Arles I was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to Marse	57.73419189453125
19777/28840	I never heard you mentioned and I did not dare inquire for	54.30562210083008
19778/28840	When I returned to Paris I learned that you the widow of	88.33250427246094

19780/28840	I inquired immediately on my return to Paris the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine	75.54434967041016
19781/28840	I pretended that I disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wifes father and mother should pass into the hands of	75.27239990234375
19782/28840	I offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded 6000 franc	75.19774627685547
19783/28840	I would have given 10000I would have given 200	48.12373733520508
19784/28840	I had the money with me I made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when I had obtained what I so much wanted I galloped to Auteu	65.65119171142578
19785/28840	No one had entered the house since I had left	55.44044494628906
19786/28840	It was five oclock in the afternoon I ascended into the red room and waited for	54.85649871826172
19787/28840	There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double	299.72833251953125
19788/28840	It was for this I had annulled the leaseit was for this I had comeit was for this I was	143.50393676757812
19789/28840	Night arrived I allowed it to become quite	249.76171875
19790/28840	I was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which I continually expected to see some spy concealed I tremb	104.84939575195312
19791/28840	I seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and I dared not turn	143.7491912841797
19792/28840	My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would	163.31271362304688
19793/28840	At length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood	180.76820373535156
19794/28840	I understood that I had nothing to fear that I should neither be seen nor heard so I decided upon descending to the	61.9395637512207
19795/28840	I descended the staircase step by step the only thing I could not conquer was a strange trembling in my	150.99708557128906
19796/28840	I grasped the railings if I had relaxed my hold for a moment I should have	82.89857482910156
19797/28840	Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall I took it and advanced towards the thick	54.008949279785156
19798/28840	I had provided myself with a dark	80.75946807861328
19799/28840	In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it then I continued my	107.73809814453125
19800/28840	It was the end of November all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my	69.51366424560547
19801/28840	My terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket that I took a pistol from my pocket and armed	79.4073486328125
19802/28840	I fancied continually that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the	58.728302001953125
19803/28840	I examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was	116.14301300048828
19804/28840	I looked carefully around I was indeed aloneno noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the	112.15502166748047
19805/28840	I tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the precise spot where I stopped to dig the	126.10877990722656
19806/28840	The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow	104.99413299560547
19807/28840	Still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there I had turned up the	256.7356872558594
19808/28840	The hour then for which I had been waiting during the last year had at length	81.4429931640625
19809/28840	How I worked how I hoped how I struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade But no I found nothing though I had made a hole twice as large as the	127.04405975341797
19810/28840	I thought I had been deceivedhad mistaken the	146.96063232421875
19811/28840	I turned around I looked at the trees I tried to recall the details which had struck me at the	56.552696228027344
19812/28840	A cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my	208.71397399902344
19813/28840	On my right I saw the tree behind me the	189.58740234375
19814/28840	I stood in the same attitude and threw myself	49.58939743041992
19815/28840	I rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still I found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there   30269m       The chest no longer there murmured Madame Danglars choking with	39.322898864746094
19816/28840	Think not I contented myself with this one effort continued Ville	88.34051513671875
19817/28840	I thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but I could find	104.67884826660156
19818/28840	Then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a	71.60739135742188
19819/28840	In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my	99.49156951904297
19820/28840	I remained in the room and	67.9897232055664
19821/28840	Oh Heaven   30271m       When daylight dawned I went down	21.26951026916504
19822/28840	My first visit was to the thick	101.75792694091797
19823/28840	I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the	58.47557830810547
19824/28840	I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two	92.35813903808594
19825/28840	A laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an	95.04530334472656
19826/28840	Supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart I returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for	78.23419952392578
19827/28840	Oh cried Madame Danglars it was enough to drive you mad   I hoped for a moment that it might said Villefort but that happiness was denied	40.569480895996094
19828/28840	However recovering my strength and my ideas Why said I should that man have carried away the corpse   But you said replied Madame Danglars he would require it as a	57.555931091308594
19829/28840	Ah no madame that could not	39.2009391784668
19830/28840	Dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is	176.7678985595703
19831/28840	Now nothing of the kind has	250.5787353515625
19832/28840	I know not I merely suppose so as I might suppose anything else replied Villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and	43.132469177246094
19833/28840	Ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handker	31.54781150817871
19834/28840	Villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror he	70.97286224365234
19835/28840	You understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are	41.503662109375

19837/28840	Just God avenging God murmured Madame Dangl	38.71365737915039
19838/28840	Villeforts only answer was a stifled gro	54.42953872680664
19839/28840	But the childthe child sir repeated the agitated	463.9110107421875
19840/28840	A child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the	56.25789260864258
19841/28840	Impossible cried Madame Danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a	84.39151000976562
19842/28840	Perhaps continued Villefort he had put it in the foundling	88.75572967529297
19843/28840	This portion of the napkin was marked with half a barons crown and the letter	101.24098205566406
19844/28840	Truly truly said Madame Danglars all my linen is marked thus Monsieur de Nargonne was a baron and my name is Her	53.14546203613281
19845/28840	Thank God my child was not then dead   No it was not	52.621185302734375
19846/28840	And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy Where is the child   Villefort shrugged his	40.297088623046875
19847/28840	Do I know said he and do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer Alas no I know	67.47809600830078
19848/28840	A woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the nap	81.82146453857422
19849/28840	This woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to	70.46707153320312
19850/28840	But you should have inquired for the woman you should have traced	116.02128601074219
19851/28840	And what do you think I did I feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of	53.617088317871094
19852/28840	They traced her to Châlons and there they lost	94.91989135742188
19853/28840	They lost her   Yes	216.14878845214844
19854/28840	Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every	45.49924850463867
19855/28840	And this is all said she and you stopped there   Oh no said Villefort I never ceased to search and to	44.224220275878906
19856/28840	However the last two or three years I had allowed myself some resp	62.02518844604492

19858/28840	But replied Madame Danglars the Count of Monte Cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he	25.689651489257812
19859/28840	Oh the wickedness of man is very great said Villefort since it surpasses the goodness of	58.48244094848633
19860/28840	Did you observe that mans eyes while he was speaking to us  	55.7374267578125

19862/28840	I might have suspected he was poisoning	156.39492797851562
19863/28840	And you see you would have been	51.536808013916016
19864/28840	But believe me that man has other	353.86907958984375

19869/28840	Do you talk in your sleep   30275m       I sleep soundly like a child do you not remember   The color mounted to the baronesss face and Villefort turned awfully	19.541887283325195
19870/28840	It is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be	31.40496253967285
19871/28840	Well I understand what I now have to do replied Ville	37.90243148803711
19872/28840	In less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this	122.60223388671875
19873/28840	de Monte Cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a	59.62873840332031
19874/28840	Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard	32.62095260620117
19875/28840	Then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the	59.81255340576172
19876/28840	Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for	42.602394104003906

19879/28840	Albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the ChampsÉlysées to the house of Monte Crist	31.780729293823242
19880/28840	The count received him with his habitual	94.18894958496094
19881/28840	It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans	103.73365783691406

19884/28840	Monte Cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable	155.4947967529297
19885/28840	From Dieppe   No from Tré	38.135032653808594
19886/28840	Indeed   And I have come at once to see	27.16697883605957
19887/28840	That is extremely kind of you said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect	23.338403701782227
19888/28840	And what is the news   You should not ask a stranger a foreigner for	73.30201721191406
19889/28840	I know it but in asking for news I mean have you done anything for me   Had you commissioned me said Monte Cristo feigning uneas	29.608888626098633
19890/28840	Come come said Albert do not assume so much	111.98535919189453
19891/28840	It is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at Tréport I felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of	101.50868225097656
19892/28840	Possibly said Monte Cristo I have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted indeed without my	106.40338134765625

19898/28840	I of course give him the same title and everyone else does	173.88427734375
19899/28840	What a strange man you are What next You say	152.2329864501953
19900/28840	Danglars dined here   Yes with Count Cavalcanti the marquis his father Madame Danglars	27.53557586669922
19901/28840	Did they speak of me   Not a	40.70011901855469
19902/28840	Why so I thought you wished them to forget you   If they did not speak of me I am sure they thought about me and I am in	38.1175422668457
19903/28840	How will that affect you since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you Truly she might have thought of you at	46.94768142700195
19904/28840	I have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which I think of	37.51942825317383
19905/28840	Touching sympathy So you hate each other said the	147.1720733642578
19906/28840	Listen said Morcerfif Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families I am ready to agree to the	36.74908447265625
19907/28840	But as this dream cannot be realized since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens	61.25585174560547
19908/28840	One may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens There she must always be and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be	47.093658447265625
19909/28840	Yes for I often wish for what is	61.38239669799805
19910/28840	What is that   To find such a wife as my father	46.64169692993164
19911/28840	Monte Cristo turned pale and looked at Albert while playing with some magnificent	74.72752380371094

19914/28840	30279m       That is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single	49.63557815551758
19915/28840	Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Dangl	15.538928031921387
19916/28840	Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has	51.03511428833008
19917/28840	That is what I call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry	87.02372741699219
19918/28840	Apropos continued he Franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him I think   I said Monte Cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that I did not like	42.965919494628906

19920/28840	Did you say he was coming   Yes summoned by	65.14051055908203
19921/28840	de Villefort who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as	50.05287170410156
19922/28840	Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie	10.988747596740723
19923/28840	It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is	118.21971130371094

19926/28840	He entertains a very high opinion of	102.8177490234375
19927/28840	Which they deserve do they not   I believe they	57.439083099365234
19928/28840	de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just	129.60568237304688
19929/28840	There is then one said Monte Cristo whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars   Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied Albert	35.85560607910156
19930/28840	Indeed my dear sir said Monte Cristo you are revoltingly fopp	31.042552947998047

19932/28840	Let things take their course perhaps you may not have to	132.04615783691406
19933/28840	Doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement   I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do	29.743064880371094
19934/28840	Danglars would give double that sum to attain the same	63.43173599243164
19935/28840	Am I indeed so happy said Albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his	92.73235321044922
19936/28840	Danglars any reason   Ah there is your proud and selfish	76.42769622802734
19937/28840	You would expose the selflove of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a	123.26709747314453
19938/28840	Danglars appeared   Delighted with you was he not Well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with	40.97801971435547

19990/28840	de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars to endeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the history of the house at Auteu	16.788957595825195
19991/28840	He wrote the same day for the required information to	164.3242950439453

19995/28840	It was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict	93.6583251953125
19996/28840	He preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chamb	60.933067321777344
19997/28840	Besides whether at home or not whether in Paris or Cairo the abbé always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his masters	78.058837890625

20002/28840	One of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of French which he however wrote with great	107.9751968383789
20003/28840	The day after this important information had been given to the kings attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue Férou and rapping at an olivegreen door asked if the Abbé Busoni were	32.891845703125

20019/28840	The abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the	55.32522201538086
20020/28840	I am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked Italian	15.858784675598145
20021/28840	The mission with which I am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is	98.1615982055664
20022/28840	Your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which I am deputed to see	59.66118621826172
20023/28840	It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the	89.30306243896484
20024/28840	Provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my	115.90921020507812

20026/28840	Do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your	101.59550476074219
20027/28840	At this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained	71.16365814208984
20028/28840	Excuse me abbé said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very	51.771514892578125
20029/28840	I will come at once to the	35.74081039428711

20032/28840	I asked you if you knew him   Extremely	45.67219161987305
20033/28840	Who is he   The son of a rich shipbuilder in	55.83494186401367
20034/28840	I know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague	71.57843780517578
20035/28840	However replied the abbé with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the	44.90791702270508
20036/28840	Are you sure of what you assert   What do you mean by that question   Understand sir I do not in the least suspect your veracity I ask if you are certain of it   I knew his father	30.03532600402832
20037/28840	Ah indeed   And when a child I often played with the son in the timbery	70.5195083618164
20038/28840	But whence does he derive the title of count   You are aware that may be	42.77191925048828
20039/28840	And his immense riches whence does he procure them   They may not be so very	82.46465301513672
20040/28840	How much do you suppose he possesses   From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per ann	29.76401138305664
20041/28840	That is reasonable said the visitor I have heard he had three or four	38.77909469604492
20042/28840	Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of	95.32798767089844
20043/28840	But I was told he had four millions per ann	62.1500358581543

20045/28840	I am told it is a delightful place   It is a	47.958534240722656
20046/28840	And why has the count bought a rock   For the sake of being a	75.51726531982422
20047/28840	In Italy one must have territorial possessions to be a	85.23910522460938

20055/28840	Doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police I ask you what you know of	51.71162033081055
20056/28840	He passes for a very charitable	98.0638198852539

20068/28840	Now sir I have but one question more to ask and I charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candid	66.81819152832031
20069/28840	What is it sir   Do you know with what design	32.54953384399414

20071/28840	What is it sir   To make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the Count of Pisani at Paler	29.33148765563965
20072/28840	Do you know about that institution   I have heard of	22.884172439575195
20073/28840	Having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his	71.07704162597656
20074/28840	The visitor either understood the abbés meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the	79.90545654296875
20075/28840	However   My resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevol	59.39884567260742
20076/28840	The abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of	46.817649841308594
20077/28840	An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the Rue FontaineSaintGeorges and stopped at	47.637794494628906
20078/28840	The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o	70.09294128417969
20079/28840	As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that Lord Wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock	63.39684295654297
20080/28840	The visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnished drawing	77.55419158935547
20081/28840	It was illuminated by lamps with groundglass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoys weak	164.44862365722656
20082/28840	After ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore	51.74678039550781

20084/28840	His first remark on entering was   You know sir I do not speak French   I know you do not like to converse in our language replied the	51.377685546875
20085/28840	But you may use it replied Lord Wilmore I understand	63.516666412353516
20086/28840	And I replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of English to keep up the	161.17471313476562
20087/28840	Do not put yourself to the slightest	135.59555053710938
20088/28840	Aw said Lord Wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of Great	50.25553512573242
20089/28840	The envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with English coolness and having finished   I understand said he	118.69107818603516
20090/28840	30293m       Then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abbé Bus	23.32530403137207
20091/28840	It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to England and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by	108.75279998779297
20092/28840	Then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in Greece broke out and he had served in the Grecian	124.19532775878906
20093/28840	While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from	67.93742370605469
20094/28840	After the battle of Navarino when the Greek government was consolidated he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district which was given	101.10739135742188
20095/28840	Hence that immense fortune which in Lord Wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the	115.4754867553711
20096/28840	But asked the visitor do you know why he came to France   He is speculating in railways said Lord Wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to	44.022396087646484
20097/28840	How much does he spend yearly asked the pre	191.4688262939453
20098/28840	Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said Lord Wilmore he is a	23.319547653198242
20099/28840	Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avar	112.85322570800781
20100/28840	Do you know his house at Auteuil  	16.424243927001953
20101/28840	What do you know respecting it   Do you wish to know why he bought it  	18.093360900878906
20102/28840	The count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in	145.09121704101562
20103/28840	He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnères Luchon and Cautere	108.560791015625
20104/28840	He is going to turn his house into a _Badhaus_ as the Germans term	42.13105392456055
20105/28840	He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous	97.71248626708984
20106/28840	Now as I dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him I am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take	111.79840087890625
20107/28840	What was the cause of your quarrel   When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my	35.247920989990234
20108/28840	Why do you not seek revenge   I have already fought three duels with him said the Englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sab	57.85056686401367

20110/28840	The Englishman turned down his shirtcollar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent	117.07564544677734
20111/28840	So that you see there is a deadly feud between	35.150840759277344
20112/28840	But said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if I understand you	47.35598373413086
20113/28840	Aw said the Englishman I practice shooting every day and every other day Grisier comes to my	143.6973876953125
20114/28840	This was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the Englishman appeared to	77.47853088378906

20121/28840	At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to	79.12738037109375
20122/28840	Until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the	74.90757751464844

20159/28840	Why so   Because it is a secret just	64.4044418334961

20162/28840	Well well Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too	100.62354278564453
20163/28840	Indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so	68.01433563232422

20170/28840	I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo replied Madame de Villefort turning away with marked coldness of	18.27509117126465
20171/28840	This answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor Mor	98.95767211914062
20172/28840	But a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her	88.04344940185547
20173/28840	They might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their	265.0896301269531
20174/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo had just	15.941498756408691
20175/28840	We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he	77.38614654541016
20176/28840	Many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more _significant_ if the expression may be	99.671630859375
20177/28840	Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be	55.1402587890625
20178/28840	Yet the Parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense	99.22563171386719
20179/28840	She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to	28.933923721313477
20180/28840	No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert who received him cord	58.55127716064453
20181/28840	Have you seen my mother asked	189.25411987304688
20182/28840	I have just had the pleasure replied the count but I have not seen your	34.413665771484375
20183/28840	See he is down there talking politics with that little group of great gen	173.31715393066406
20184/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great	74.17654418945312
20185/28840	And for what kind of talent are they celebrated You know there are different	132.07260131835938
20186/28840	That tall harshlooking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of Rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the	128.7538604736328
20187/28840	The thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his	139.3203887939453
20188/28840	I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor was made an	36.08087921142578
20189/28840	Come said Monte Cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely	31.588565826416016
20190/28840	I suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a	52.69367599487305
20191/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo so this gentleman is an Academician   Within the last week he has been made one of the learned	43.624305725097656
20192/28840	And what is his especial talent   His talent I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whale	88.34392547607422
20193/28840	And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this   No of the French	45.523765563964844
20194/28840	But what has the French Academy to do with all this   I was going to tell	20.87930679321289
20195/28840	It seems   That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless   No that his style of writing is very	147.84991455078125
20196/28840	This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out   Albert	72.18939208984375
20197/28840	And the other one demanded the	102.43535614013672
20198/28840	That one   Yes the	45.8170166015625
20199/28840	The one in the dark blue coat  	53.15946578979492
20200/28840	He is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a	53.09063720703125
20201/28840	He was very successful upon that	169.15663146972656
20202/28840	He stood badly with the Liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the	118.39832305908203
20203/28840	They talk of making him an	161.44371032714844
20204/28840	30303m       And what are his claims to the peerage   He has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the _Siècle_ and voted five or six years on the ministerial	37.50128936767578
20205/28840	Bravo viscount said Monte Cristo smiling you are a delightful _cicerone	33.32988739013672
20206/28840	And now you will do me a favor will you not   What is it   Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn	32.39411544799805
20207/28840	Just then the count felt his arm	75.06974029541016
20208/28840	Ah is it you baron said	37.27510070800781
20209/28840	Why do you call me baron said Danglars you know that I care nothing for my	23.637544631958008
20210/28840	I am not like you viscount you like your title do you not   Certainly replied Albert seeing that without my title I should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the	63.71708679199219
20211/28840	Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July replied Dangl	45.74734115600586
20212/28840	Unfortunately said Monte Cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of France or academician for example the millionaires Franck  Poulmann of Frankfurt who have just become bankrupt	118.70873260498047
20213/28840	Yes I received the news this evening by a	116.35514831542969
20214/28840	I had about a million in their hands but warned in time I withdrew it a month	143.5644989013672
20215/28840	Ah _mon Dieu_ exclaimed Danglars they have drawn on me for 200000 francs   Well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per	31.9200439453125
20216/28840	Yes but it is too late said Danglars I have honored their	23.833707809448242
20217/28840	Then said Monte Cristo here are 200000 francs gone after   Hush do not mention these things said Danglars then approaching Monte Cristo he added especially before young	43.483272552490234
20218/28840	Cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in	150.443115234375
20219/28840	Albert had left the count to speak to his mother Danglars to converse with young Cavalcanti Monte Cristo was for an instant	35.28774642944336
20220/28840	The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with 	328.59503173828125
20221/28840	Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refresh	44.07292938232422
20222/28840	Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of	46.481544494628906
20223/28840	Albert she asked did you notice that   What mother   That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of	58.13506317138672
20224/28840	Yes but then he breakfasted with meindeed he made his first appearance in the world on that	53.54832077026367
20225/28840	de Morcerfs murmured Mercédès and since he has been here I have watched	20.81406593322754
20226/28840	Well   Well he has taken nothing	78.98506927490234
20227/28840	Approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking	300.09771728515625
20228/28840	But why mother   Just to please me Albert said Mercédè	45.29930877685547
20229/28840	Albert kissed his mothers hand and drew near the	61.059791564941406
20230/28840	Another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately	231.57113647460938
20231/28840	Albert rejoined his mother she was very	55.012516021728516
20232/28840	Well said she you see he refuses   Yes but why need this annoy you   You know Albert women are singular	69.83879089355469
20233/28840	I should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an	77.58751678466797
20234/28840	Perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living and might prefer something	90.44868469238281
20235/28840	Oh no I have seen him eat of everything in Italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this	70.75474548339844
20236/28840	And besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we	94.2855224609375
20237/28840	I do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the	46.248233795166016
20238/28840	In a word said Mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was	23.81503677368164
20239/28840	A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the	60.33104705810547
20240/28840	Dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated	114.5361557006836
20241/28840	At the same time Mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes	24.945789337158203
20242/28840	She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the	70.19796752929688
20243/28840	Do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer I should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not	130.62176513671875

20245/28840	Then said Mercédès I will lead the	22.058937072753906
20246/28840	Turning towards Monte Cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm   The count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on Mercédè	35.210750579833984
20247/28840	It was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one	88.24995422363281
20248/28840	He offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camell	56.41633224487305
20249/28840	Behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of	75.4213638305664
20250/28840	Bread and Salt   Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her	64.34007263183594
20251/28840	It led through a grove of lindens to a conserv	183.1394805908203
20252/28840	It was too warm in the room was it not count she	114.18514251708984
20253/28840	Yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blind	34.6805534362793
20254/28840	As he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of Mercédès trem	27.79271125793457
20255/28840	But you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold   Do you know where I am leading you said the countess without replying to the	53.13090515136719
20256/28840	No madame replied Monte Cristo but you see I make no	18.57585334777832
20257/28840	We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the gro	55.52293014526367
20258/28840	The count looked at Mercédès as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from	32.58610534667969
20259/28840	They reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our	78.8102798461914
20260/28840	The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo and gathered a bunch of Muscatel	32.817626953125
20261/28840	See count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our French grapes are not to be compared I know with yours of Sicily and Cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern	86.10831451416016
20262/28840	Do you refuse said Mercédès in a tremulous	14.3771333694458
20263/28840	Pray excuse me madame replied Monte Cristo but I never eat Muscatel	22.32842254638672
20264/28840	A magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial	127.36042785644531
20265/28840	Mercédès drew near and plucked the	20.361238479614258
20266/28840	What again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain	138.67059326171875
20267/28840	A long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the	203.19102478027344
20268/28840	Count added Mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful Arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same	48.465335845947266
20269/28840	I know it madame replied the count but we are in France and not in Arabia and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one	53.007568359375
20270/28840	Certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be   The answer was so little like the one Mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a gro	51.77906799316406
20271/28840	They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a	62.50137710571289
20272/28840	Sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply   I have suffered deeply madame answered Monte Crist	56.78657150268555
20273/28840	But now you are happy   Doubtless replied the count since no one hears me	48.30991744995117
20274/28840	And your present happiness has it softened your heart   My present happiness equals my past misery said the	110.03652954101562
20275/28840	Are you not married asked the count	38.30091094970703
20276/28840	I married exclaimed Monte Cristo shuddering who could have told you so   No one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely	52.831295013427734

20282/28840	At Malta I loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me	105.95130157470703
20283/28840	I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my	43.8773193359375
20284/28840	This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of	29.24042510986328
20285/28840	Perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and I suffered more than they would have done in my place that is	64.47471618652344
20286/28840	The countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for	65.01737213134766
20287/28840	Yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again   30309m      	33.55239486694336

20289/28840	She is then now at Malta   I think	82.8233413696289

20291/28840	But only her do you then still hate those who separated you   I hate them Not at all why should I The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed	71.8298110961914
20292/28840	Madame I never eat Muscatel grapes replied Monte Cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned	31.408781051635742
20293/28840	The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of	109.2718276977539
20294/28840	Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to	45.49742889404297

20303/28840	And she took two or three steps	88.69053649902344
20304/28840	Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them	54.27063751220703
20305/28840	We are friends are we not she	169.42567443847656

20307/28840	The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her	33.939945220947266
20308/28840	Do not my mother and you agree asked Albert	197.71849060058594

20348/28840	He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that Valentine ran to him saying   Oh father some misfortune has happened   Your grandmamma has just arrived Valentine said	38.10026931762695

20469/28840	She stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of Maximil	99.67837524414062
20470/28840	The Promise   It was indeed Maximilian Morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous	34.78296661376953
20471/28840	With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of Madame de SaintMéran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at	41.743080139160156
20472/28840	de Villeforts in connection with his attachment for	76.87804412841797
20473/28840	His presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnutt	125.21041107177734
20474/28840	Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through	84.88557434082031
20475/28840	Morrel called her and she ran to the	52.360313415527344
20476/28840	You here at this hour said	147.2627716064453
20477/28840	Yes my poor girl replied Morrel I come to bring and to hear bad tid	57.4562873840332
20478/28840	This is indeed a house of mourning said Valentine speak Maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already	216.53782653808594
20479/28840	Dear Valentine said Morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen I entreat you what I am about to say is very	35.182708740234375
20480/28840	When are you to be married   I will tell you all said Valentine from you I have nothing to	31.906539916992188
20481/28840	This morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom I depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of	125.26248931884766
20482/28840	dÉpinay and the following day the contract will be	29.67886734008789
20483/28840	A deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he	119.74958801269531
20484/28840	Alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own	144.67491149902344
20485/28840	The sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and I will not endeavor to prevent	64.51844787597656

20488/28840	dÉpinay for he came this morning to	56.53277587890625
20489/28840	I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since said Morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and I of your grief when a carriage rolled into the	58.461944580078125
20490/28840	Never till then had I placed any confidence in presentiments but now I cannot help believing them	189.5601043701172
20491/28840	At the sound of that carriage I shuddered soon I heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don	97.84741973876953
20492/28840	Perhaps I turned pale and trembled but certainly I smiled and five minutes after I left without having heard one word that had	100.75505828857422
20493/28840	Valentine the time has arrived when you must answer	96.79322052001953

20495/28840	What do you intend doing Valentine held down her head she was	144.987548828125
20496/28840	There are such in the world and God will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune	166.98199462890625
20497/28840	Do you intend to struggle against our illfortune Tell me Valentine for it is that I came to	58.738216400146484
20498/28840	Valentine trembled and looked at him with amaz	19.19359588623047
20499/28840	The idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to	81.10025787353516
20500/28840	What do you say Maximilian asked	19.700288772583008
20501/28840	What do you mean by a struggle Oh it would be a sacri	31.182727813720703
20502/28840	What I resist my fathers order and my dying grandmothers wish Impossible   Morrel	90.8978271484375
20503/28840	You are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear Maximil	49.25309371948242
20504/28840	No no I shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you	123.2682113647461
20505/28840	But to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever   You are right said Morrel	52.8574104309082

20509/28840	Villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your	34.88703918457031
20510/28840	What would you have proposed Maximilian had you found me willing to accede   It is not for me to	30.442602157592773
20511/28840	You are wrong you must advise me what to	63.722347259521484
20512/28840	Do you seriously ask my advice Valentine   Certainly dear Maximilian for if it is good I will follow it you know my devotion to	48.21208190917969
20513/28840	Valentine said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my	79.34659576416016
20514/28840	Oh if you refuse my advice   What do you advise said Valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sigh	24.619234085083008
20515/28840	I am free replied Maximilian and rich enough to support	47.65943908691406
20516/28840	I swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your	144.89768981933594
20517/28840	You make me tremble said the young	29.451749801635742

20519/28840	We will embark for Algiers for England for America or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to Paris when our friends have reconciled your	86.19808197021484
20520/28840	Yesif I die   Well Valentine resumed Maximilian I can only say again that you are	33.49766540527344
20521/28840	Truly it is I who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well	108.6535415649414
20522/28840	It is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to	63.982460021972656
20523/28840	I think only that I have known you not a whole	67.31505584716797
20524/28840	From the day I first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your	94.23616027832031
20525/28840	One day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to	130.50267028808594
20526/28840	Now I think no more I say only that fortune has turned against meI had thought to gain heaven and now I have lost	109.010986328125
20527/28840	It is an everyday occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has	72.80169677734375
20528/28840	Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness Valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her	55.85459518432617
20529/28840	But in a word what are you going to do asked	32.34355163574219
20530/28840	I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your	43.17900466918945

20533/28840	Has your resolution changed Valentine   It cannot change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young	122.557861328125
20534/28840	Then adieu Valentine   Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as Morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung	48.884727478027344
20535/28840	I must know what you mean to do said	23.58660316467285
20536/28840	Where are you going   Oh fear not said Maximilian stopping at a short distance I do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for	40.016151428222656
20537/28840	Franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be	86.31583404541016
20538/28840	Franz to do with it He saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen	65.31240844726562
20539/28840	He did not even know I existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be	69.3701171875

20543/28840	Maximilian said Valentine Maximilian come back I entreat you   He drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy	37.66438674926758
20544/28840	Listen my dear my adored Valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each others	131.4993133544922
20545/28840	I never was romantic and am no melancholy	413.4241943359375
20546/28840	I imitate neither Manfred nor Anthony but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are right in doing soI repeat it you are right but in losing you I lose my	84.8520278930664
20547/28840	The moment you leave me Valentine I am alone in the	54.8804931640625
20548/28840	My sister is happily married her husband is only my brotherinlaw that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless	99.09446716308594
20549/28840	This is what I shall do I will wait until the very moment you are married for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since	47.192039489746094
20550/28840	Franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is	191.72947692871094
20551/28840	30333m       Valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her	36.26585006713867
20552/28840	The young man stood before her sorrowful and res	67.52157592773438
20553/28840	Oh for pitys sake said she you will live will you not   No on my honor said Maximilian but that will not affect	24.763614654541016
20554/28840	You have done your duty and your conscience will be at	55.534950256347656
20555/28840	Valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting	83.0442886352539
20556/28840	Maximilian said she Maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven I entreat you do as I do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be	60.99629211425781
20557/28840	My God said Valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression I have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter I have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my	96.49861145019531
20558/28840	It is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness I am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of	96.89851379394531

20561/28840	Morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the	87.07012939453125
20562/28840	Valentine said he dear Valentine you must not speak thusrather let me	38.68995666503906
20563/28840	Why should I obtain you by violence if our love is mutual Is it from mere humanity you bid me live I would then rather	165.01071166992188
20564/28840	I will leave the paternal home I will give up	64.48689270019531
20565/28840	Oh ungrateful girl that I am cried Valentine sobbing I will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom I had nearly	59.9309196472168
20566/28840	No said Maximilian you shall not leave	19.852731704711914
20567/28840	Noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards	84.30644226074219
20568/28840	Well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in Gods	169.55653381347656

20573/28840	Yes we will wait replied Valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we	91.3750228881836
20574/28840	I rely on you Valentine said Morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and Madame de SaintMéran insist that	47.67140197753906
20575/28840	dÉpinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract   Then you have my promise Maximil	53.987037658691406
20576/28840	Instead of signing   I will go to you and we will fly but from this moment until then let us not tempt Providence let us not see each	61.37505340576172
20577/28840	It is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been	37.407623291015625
20578/28840	If we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further	74.90943908691406
20579/28840	You are right Valentine but how shall I ascertain   From the notary	57.9124755859375
20580/28840	And for myselfI will write to you depend on	71.0545425415039
20581/28840	I dread this marriage Maximilian as much as	49.71320343017578
20582/28840	Thank you my adored Valentine thank you that is	101.7262954711914

20584/28840	My adored Valentine words cannot express one half of my	522.6996459960938
20585/28840	Valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of Morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable	73.13426208496094
20586/28840	Adieu then till we meet again said Valentine tearing herself	211.61412048339844
20587/28840	I shall hear from you  	22.504749298095703
20588/28840	Thanks thanks dear love adieu   The sound of a kiss was heard and Valentine fled through the	120.5416259765625
20589/28840	Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also	67.99870300292969
20590/28840	The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any	82.44464111328125
20591/28840	It was only on the following day at about ten oclock in the morning as he was starting to call on	30.18474006652832
20592/28840	Deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from Valentine although he had not before seen her	100.89159393310547
20593/28840	It was to this effect   Tears entreaties prayers have availed me	148.14610290527344
20594/28840	Yesterday for two hours I was at the church of SaintPhilippeduRoule and for two hours I prayed most ferv	30.650432586669922
20595/28840	Heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o	36.99738311767578
20596/28840	I have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also	164.9278106689453
20597/28840	This evening then at a quarter to nine at the	83.70922088623047
20598/28840	Your betrothed   Valentine de Ville	14.211616516113281
20599/28840	My poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost	237.43727111816406
20600/28840	You will be very kind to me will you not Morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier that the contract is to be signed this	38.60698699951172
20601/28840	Morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that	51.08236312866211
20602/28840	Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and heard still	64.82299041748047
20603/28840	Franz had been to announce the ceremony and Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of	56.89583206176758
20604/28840	de SaintMéran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every	75.2456283569336
20605/28840	The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de SaintMéran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately	28.65003776550293
20606/28840	It is easy to suppose that Morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetrating	50.85585021972656
20607/28840	Monte Cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the point of telling him	61.29301834106445
20608/28840	But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine and kept his	96.26596069335938
20609/28840	The young man read Valentines letter twenty times in the course of the	75.71279907226562
20610/28840	It was her first and on what an occasion Each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her	151.68423461914062
20611/28840	Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say Here I am Maximilian come and help	65.50694274902344
20612/28840	Occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate	71.87771606445312
20613/28840	When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated	157.81053161621094
20614/28840	He shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the	69.14396667480469
20615/28840	Never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on	242.8709716796875
20616/28840	Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at halfpast	80.83177947998047
20617/28840	He then said It is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps Valentine will not wait for	69.36575317382812
20618/28840	Consequently Morrel having left the Rue Meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of SaintPhilippeduRoule was striking	43.137847900390625
20619/28840	The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where Morrel had often	89.28761291503906
20620/28840	The night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper	237.28912353515625
20621/28840	Then Morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be	50.73169708251953
20622/28840	The clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting while Morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the	80.14031219482422
20623/28840	The garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of	91.2424087524414
20624/28840	The house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going	69.52354431152344
20625/28840	Morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking halfpast	91.84772491455078
20626/28840	This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had	101.75748443603516
20627/28840	It was a terrible moment for the young	39.664817810058594
20628/28840	The slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first	52.50897979736328
20629/28840	Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck	146.46316528320312
20630/28840	It is impossible said Maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interrupt	94.84288787841797
20631/28840	I have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have	151.49102783203125
20632/28840	And then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the	86.73663330078125
20633/28840	Had Valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight These were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young	84.63774108886719
20634/28840	The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his	68.22224426269531
20635/28840	In that case said he I should lose her and by my own	62.47747802734375
20636/28840	He dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared	79.10051727294922
20637/28840	He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate	46.8193473815918
20638/28840	It was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other	58.02934646606445
20639/28840	He was on Villeforts premiseshad arrived there by scaling the	96.94727325439453
20640/28840	What might be the consequences However he had not ventured thus far to draw	137.9462432861328
20641/28840	He followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of	121.66680908203125
20642/28840	In a moment he had passed through them and could see the house	73.32341003417969
20643/28840	30341m       Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not	20.753864288330078
20644/28840	Instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble	141.13555908203125
20645/28840	A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second	98.09992218017578
20646/28840	These three windows were in Madame de SaintMérans	27.745420455932617
20647/28840	Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villeforts	38.47744369506836
20648/28840	So many times in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it	73.97552490234375
20649/28840	This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentines absence had	148.7313232421875
20650/28840	At this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motion	130.74951171875
20651/28840	If it was Valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible	76.32467651367188
20652/28840	The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in	50.31731414794922
20653/28840	They descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as Doctor dAvrign	37.26415252685547
20654/28840	30339m       The young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamoretree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to	36.57999038696289
20655/28840	Who could be dead in that house which Villefort himself had called accursed   My dear	51.03941345214844
20656/28840	de Villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man I have not led you here to console you on the contrary   What can you mean asked the procureur	24.703794479370117
20657/28840	I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still	61.10248947143555
20658/28840	Can it be possible murmured Villefort clasping his	18.470041275024414
20659/28840	What are you going to tell me   Are we quite alone my friend   Yes quite but why all these precautions   Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the	29.048471450805664
20660/28840	The doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his	54.10882568359375
20661/28840	Morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be	66.90478515625
20662/28840	Dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also	110.91800689697266
20663/28840	Speak doctorI am listening said Villefort strikeI am prepared for everything   Madame de SaintMéran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent	75.41510772705078
20664/28840	Morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten	67.17534637451172
20665/28840	Villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amaz	48.77669143676758
20666/28840	Were you present during the last struggle asked	374.0342712402344
20667/28840	I was replied the procureur you begged me not to	60.68711853027344
20668/28840	Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de SaintMéran has fallen a victim   I	25.416013717651367
20669/28840	Madame de SaintMéran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the	51.517913818359375
20670/28840	Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had	91.4898681640625
20671/28840	This crisis past I endeavored to catch your eye but could	183.95053100585938
20672/28840	You held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards	222.47425842285156
20673/28840	This was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned	127.568359375
20674/28840	At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my	104.829345703125
20675/28840	Yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone   What are you going to say Oh spare me   That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the	29.36040687561035
20676/28840	de Villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motion	36.03704071044922
20677/28840	Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or	117.65335845947266
20678/28840	Listen said the doctor I know the full importance of the statement I have just made and the disposition of the man to whom I have made	45.719112396240234
20679/28840	Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked Ville	36.007503509521484
20680/28840	As a friend and only as a friend at this	60.709869384765625
20681/28840	The similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated I should hesitate I therefore repeat to you I speak not to a magistrate but to a	62.231021881103516
20682/28840	Can it be possible   The symptoms are marked do you seesleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve	94.08939361572266
20683/28840	Madame de SaintMéran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to	58.93120193481445
20684/28840	Oh it is impossible said he I must be dreaming It is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you Tell me I entreat you my dear doctor that you may be	40.389305114746094
20685/28840	Doubtless I may but   But   30345m       But I do not think	18.750572204589844
20686/28840	Have pity on me doctor So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of	87.40737915039062
20687/28840	Has anyone besides me seen Madame de SaintMéran  	37.19574737548828
20688/28840	Has anything been sent for from a chemists that I have not examined  	125.18623352050781
20689/28840	Had Madame de SaintMéran any enemies   Not to my	31.067617416381836
20690/28840	Would her death affect anyones interest   It could not indeed my daughter is her only heiressValentine	128.1676025390625
20691/28840	Oh if such a thought could present itself I would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored	109.68193817138672
20692/28840	dAvrigny I would not accuse anyone I speak only of an accident you understandof a mistakebut whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to	110.18711853027344
20693/28840	Of whomhowof what   May not Barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given Madame de SaintMéran a dose prepared for his master   For my father  	39.62835693359375
20694/28840	But how could a dose prepared for	151.91522216796875
20695/28840	Noirtier poison Madame de SaintMéran   Nothing is more	23.56886100769043
20696/28840	You know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is	178.2933349609375
20697/28840	For instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to	487.2718811035156
20698/28840	Noirtier I resolved to try one last means and for three months I have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six	72.61001586914062
20699/28840	This quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of	147.9909210205078
20700/28840	Noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another	55.50657272338867
20701/28840	My dear doctor there is no communication between	171.83323669433594
20702/28840	Noirtiers apartment and that of Madame de SaintMéran and Barrois never entered my motherinlaws	25.48349380493164
20703/28840	In short doctor although I know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although I place the utmost reliance in you I want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom _errare humanum est	90.54840850830078
20704/28840	Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself   Why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish   Send for him I will tell him what I have seen and we will consult together and examine the	42.5829963684082
20705/28840	Let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with	89.06259155273438
20706/28840	Pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest I should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know	57.70735168457031
20707/28840	Doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you   My dear	81.6801528930664
20708/28840	de Villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to	84.87420654296875
20709/28840	I would have saved Madame de SaintMéran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the	39.4846076965332
20710/28840	Let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts I am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my	73.01303100585938
20711/28840	Meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop	315.5541076660156
20712/28840	And when you have found the culprit if you find him I will say to you You are a magistrate do as you will   I thank you doctor said Villefort with indescribable joy I never had a better friend than	29.326627731323242
20713/28840	And as if he feared Doctor dAvrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the	47.17770767211914
20714/28840	When they were gone Morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a	56.742835998535156
20715/28840	I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but Valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow   As he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white	76.76679229736328
20716/28840	The light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the	101.87833404541016
20717/28840	At the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows	30.916519165039062
20718/28840	A waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the	107.1142349243164
20719/28840	Morrel shuddered he thought he heard a	38.03080749511719
20720/28840	It cannot be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious	125.23698425292969
20721/28840	Although it was impossible that Valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him	90.44588470458984
20722/28840	Her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards	101.91948699951172
20723/28840	Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her	220.9822235107422
20724/28840	Meanwhile Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of	62.220577239990234
20725/28840	de Villefort even would not have alarmed	39.01960372924805
20726/28840	He was quite prepared for any such	120.3539810180664
20727/28840	He would at once approach Valentines father and acknowledge all begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving	168.8594970703125
20728/28840	Now especially did he find the description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to	83.57815551757812
20729/28840	He turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in	110.7887191772461
20730/28840	He pushed the door open and	85.29037475585938
20731/28840	At the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly	63.70277786254883
20732/28840	By its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easychair was Valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and	69.0488510131836
20733/28840	She had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utter	75.5124740600586
20734/28840	The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole	80.78450775146484
20735/28840	Morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but Valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in	71.16399383544922
20736/28840	He sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a Magdalen by Correggiowas raised and turned towards	77.59517669677734
20737/28840	Valentine perceived him without betraying the least	98.15813446044922
20738/28840	A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor	231.2842254638672
20739/28840	Morrel held out his hand to	22.387474060058594
20740/28840	Valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob	74.17318725585938
20741/28840	Neither dared for some time to speak in that	66.4817886352539
20742/28840	They hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length Valentine	186.16201782226562
20743/28840	My friend said she how came you here Alas I would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this	146.60906982421875
20744/28840	Valentine said Morrel with a trembling voice I had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come I became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event   What voices asked	85.18262481689453
20745/28840	Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and	26.749191284179688
20746/28840	de Villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple	76.76679229736328
20747/28840	Your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them I learned it	110.42781066894531
20748/28840	But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here	120.61067199707031
20749/28840	Forgive me replied Morrel I will go	25.88814353942871
20750/28840	No said Valentine you might meet someone	266.6413879394531
20751/28840	But if anyone should come here   The young girl shook her	25.609724044799805
20752/28840	No one will come said she do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the	73.06371307373047

20754/28840	Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was	194.90679931640625
20755/28840	Alas said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed	69.95024108886719
20756/28840	They both listened steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the	136.53762817382812
20757/28840	It is my father who has just left his	50.808353424072266

20760/28840	I imagined it must be said Mor	56.47075271606445
20761/28840	Valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then	78.69327545166016
20762/28840	de Villefort locked the garden door and returned	90.36436462402344
20763/28840	He stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de SaintMérans Morrel concealed himself behind a door Valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all	53.032142639160156
20764/28840	de Villefort passed on to his own	36.836151123046875
20765/28840	Now said Valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the	163.93377685546875
20766/28840	There is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfathers	128.32615661621094
20767/28840	Can you mean it Valentine   I have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help	120.37183380126953
20768/28840	Be careful Valentine said Morrel hesitating to comply with the young girls wishes I now see my errorI acted like a madman in coming in	74.66831970214844
20769/28840	Are you sure you are more reasonable   Yes said Valentine and I have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which I had undertaken to	42.787357330322266
20770/28840	Valentine said Morrel death is in itself	104.36485290527344
20771/28840	Yes said Valentine besides it will not be for	63.89824676513672
20772/28840	She then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to	117.35342407226562
20773/28840	Noirtiers room Morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old	24.160396575927734
20774/28840	Barrois said Valentine shut the door and let no one come	101.05514526367188
20775/28840	Noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw Valentine and his eye bright	42.46791076660156
20776/28840	There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrog	71.33726501464844
20777/28840	said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now I have no friend in the world but	64.17926788330078
20778/28840	His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tender	127.94283294677734
20779/28840	To you alone then may I confide my sorrows and my hopes   The paralytic motioned	64.90792846679688
20780/28840	The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Mor	52.7474250793457
20781/28840	Maximilian Morrel said she the son of that good merchant of Marseilles whom you doubtless recol	39.15602111816406
20782/28840	He brings an irreproachable name which Maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the Legion of	49.15339279174805
20783/28840	The old man signified that he recollected	43.41870880126953
20784/28840	Well grandpapa said Valentine kneeling before him and pointing to Maximilian I love him and will be only his were I compelled to marry another I would destroy	70.48145294189453
20785/28840	The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous	104.85279846191406
20786/28840	Maximilian Morrel do you not grandpapa asked	16.466856002807617
20787/28840	And you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father   Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel as if to say perhaps I	43.6679801940918
20788/28840	Mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmothers room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with	40.18962097167969
20789/28840	Noirtier   That is it said the old mans	15.24045181274414
20790/28840	Do you fear he will not understand  	37.828041076660156
20791/28840	Oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how I talk to	64.00800323486328
20792/28840	Then turning to Maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrowHe knows everything I know said	96.18286895751953
20793/28840	Valentine arose placed a chair for Morrel requested Barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel she went	82.62677764892578
20794/28840	To prove to Noirtier that he was in Valentines confidence and knew all their secrets Morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a	55.23412322998047
20795/28840	But first said Morrel allow me sir to tell you who I am how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine and what are my designs respecting	52.05729293823242
20796/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he would	14.915215492248535
20797/28840	It was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and	263.34521484375
20798/28840	His remarkably noble and austere expression struck Morrel who began his story with	406.92498779296875
20799/28840	He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine and how he had loved her and that Valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his	63.11921310424805
20800/28840	He told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered That is good	134.89024353027344
20801/28840	And now said Morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now I have told you of my love and my hopes may I inform you of my intentions   Yes signified the old	33.358673095703125
20802/28840	This was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sisters house to marry her and to wait respectfully	71.07982635498047
20803/28840	We must not do so  	29.998992919921875
20804/28840	You do not sanction our project  	29.10750389099121
20805/28840	The old mans interrogative eye said Which   I will go continued Maximilian I will seek	50.564422607421875
20806/28840	Franz dÉpinayI am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villeforts absenceand will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge	40.05827713012695
20807/28840	You wish to know what I will do  	17.07729721069336
20808/28840	I will find him as I told	18.523204803466797
20809/28840	Noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful	67.5843505859375
20810/28840	Still when Morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying	82.49234008789062
20811/28840	No said Morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first   I do signified the old	40.833553314208984
20812/28840	But what then must be done asked Mor	46.37336349487305
20813/28840	Madame de SaintMérans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must I let things take their course Noirtier did not	84.40370178222656
20814/28840	I understand said Morrel I am to	24.0982666015625
20815/28840	But delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young	100.69617462158203
20816/28840	Alone Valentine has no power she will be compelled to	148.7412567138672
20817/28840	I am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur	88.0930404663086
20818/28840	Believe me there are only the two plans I have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you	81.9493408203125
20819/28840	Do you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor  	37.74477005004883
20820/28840	Do you prefer I should seek	192.02098083496094
20821/28840	Whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed Mor	645.8453369140625
20822/28840	You thoroughly understand me sir Pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your	88.73419189453125
20823/28840	Will our help come from you  	87.67644500732422
20824/28840	You are sure of it  	14.10592269897461
20825/28840	There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his	113.92598724365234
20826/28840	Then I must wait asked the young	77.8252182006836
20827/28840	But the contract The same smile	459.862060546875
20828/28840	Will you assure me it shall not be signed   Yes said Noirt	30.36963653564453
20829/28840	The contract shall not be signed cried Mor	96.82710266113281
20830/28840	Oh pardon me sir I can scarcely realize so great a	106.45259857177734
20831/28840	Will they not sign it   No said the paraly	59.148311614990234
20832/28840	This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled	45.95443344116211
20833/28840	Whether Noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at	29.022573471069336
20834/28840	What do you wish sir asked Morrel that I should renew my promise of remaining tranquil Noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his	60.89643859863281
20835/28840	Shall I swear to you sir asked Maximil	27.569469451904297
20836/28840	Yes said the paralytic with the same solemn	26.51382827758789
20837/28840	Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an	84.36515808105469
20838/28840	I swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course I am to pursue with	52.78553771972656
20839/28840	That is right said the old	23.429288864135742
20840/28840	Now said Morrel do you wish me to retire  	20.924785614013672
20841/28840	Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine  	13.762861251831055
20842/28840	Morrel made a sign that he was ready to	21.24195671081543
20843/28840	But said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just	87.99613952636719
20844/28840	The young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where Valentines had	47.24055480957031
20845/28840	Then he bowed a second time and	136.38966369628906
20846/28840	He found outside the door the old servant to whom Valentine had given	82.47078704833984
20847/28840	He got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay threw himself on his bed and slept sound	62.09811019897461
20848/28840	The Villefort Family Vault   Two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten oclock in the morning around the door of	30.618324279785156
20849/28840	de Villeforts house and a long file of mourningcoaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg SaintHonoré and the Rue de la Pépini	24.707529067993164
20850/28840	Among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a	60.95253372192383
20851/28840	It was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to	99.60739135742188
20852/28840	Inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de SaintMéran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow	86.70040893554688
20853/28840	The Marquis de SaintMéran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XV	31.04950523376465
20854/28840	had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on formed a considerable	147.0238494873047
20855/28840	Due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same	52.637760162353516
20856/28840	A second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to	237.00425720214844
20857/28840	de Villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the post	80.70264434814453
20858/28840	The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of PèreLachaise where	36.999027252197266
20859/28840	de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his	41.979007720947266
20860/28840	The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with	78.44869995117188
20861/28840	The Parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracythe greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their	153.66358947753906
20862/28840	In one of the mourningcoaches Beauchamp Debray and ChâteauRenaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchion	17.864032745361328
20863/28840	How old was she   Franz assured me replied Albert that she was sixtysix years	62.227760314941406
20864/28840	But she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her	74.39478302001953
20865/28840	But of what disease then did she die asked Debr	67.88391876220703
20866/28840	It is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not  	30.2349910736084
20867/28840	It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said Beauch	20.64969825744629
20868/28840	Madame de SaintMéran whom I once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de SaintMé	52.74171447753906
20869/28840	At any rate said Albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her	201.4655303955078
20870/28840	de Villefort or rather Mademoiselle Valentineor still rather our friend Franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting I believe to 80000 livres per ann	51.33510208129883
20871/28840	And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin Noirt	31.85021209716797
20872/28840	That is a tenacious old grandfather said Beauch	52.045902252197266
20873/28840	I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to	80.7728271484375
20874/28840	He resembles the old Conventionalist of 93 who said to Napoleon in 1814 You bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid	135.27239990234375
20875/28840	Take the Republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battlefield and I promise you 500000 soldiers another Marengo and a second Austerl	109.70002746582031
20876/28840	Ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep	319.6161804199219
20877/28840	Ideas and men appeared the same to him said	268.55194091796875
20878/28840	One thing only puzzles me namely how Franz dÉpinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his	76.64781188964844
20879/28840	But where is Franz   In the first carriage with	45.91740798950195
20880/28840	de Villefort who considers him already as one of the	32.79134750366211
20881/28840	40024m       Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which	66.63936614990234
20882/28840	dAvrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to	40.842491149902344
20883/28840	They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral	164.1848907470703
20884/28840	Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault ChâteauRenaud recognized Morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yewt	44.748390197753906
20885/28840	You here said ChâteauRenaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a friend of Villeforts How is it that I have never met you at his house   I am no acquaintance of	28.662343978881836
20886/28840	de Villeforts answered Morrel but I was of Madame de SaintMé	22.728477478027344
20887/28840	Albert came up to them at this moment with	94.14535522460938
20888/28840	The time and place are but illsuited for an	666.0394897460938
20889/28840	said Albert but we are not superst	69.43574523925781
20890/28840	Morrel allow me to present to you	43.16386413574219
20891/28840	Franz dÉpinay a delightful travelling companion with whom I made the tour of	78.11885833740234
20892/28840	Maximilian Morrel an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection wit or am	65.02778625488281
20893/28840	Morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to	58.52556610107422
20894/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said Debray to	20.05011749267578
20895/28840	Extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning I scarcely knew	195.8536376953125
20896/28840	These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the	267.5060729980469

20898/28840	He took the arm of ChâteauRenaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coff	25.872934341430664
20899/28840	This is a magnificent habitation said Beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter	141.5934600830078
20900/28840	You will in turn enter it my dear dÉpinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the	44.368892669677734

20904/28840	Politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve	102.79249572753906

20906/28840	The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance	132.1822967529297
20907/28840	The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the Villefort and SaintMéran coff	65.3769760131836
20908/28840	There grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit PèreLachaise or by lovers who make it their rend	75.96952819824219
20909/28840	The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the righthand crypt belonging to the SaintMéran	58.030479431152344
20910/28840	Villefort Franz and a few near relatives alone entered the	86.29427337646484
20911/28840	As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated ChâteauRenaud Albert and Morrel went one way and Debray and Beauchamp the	45.53040313720703
20912/28840	de Villefort at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse to wait he saw Franz and	45.61937713623047
20913/28840	de Villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded	79.83069610595703
20914/28840	He then returned to Paris and although in the same carriage with ChâteauRenaud and Albert he did not hear one word of their	26.111026763916016
20915/28840	As Franz was about to take leave of	34.035125732421875
20916/28840	de Villefort When shall I see you again said the	53.984493255615234
20917/28840	At what time you please sir replied	83.48957061767578

20921/28840	Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg SaintHonor	6.585855960845947

20927/28840	Then said Villefort nothing further is	67.74710083007812
20928/28840	The contract was to have been signed three days since we shall find it all ready and can sign it	97.27967071533203
20929/28840	Dont be uneasy on that score replied Villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my	49.871646881103516
20930/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of SaintMéran I say hers for she inherits it	41.02098083496094

20932/28840	Madame de SaintMéran wished her daughter should be married	42.88335037231445

20936/28840	Sir said Franz I have one request to	68.65340423583984

20939/28840	I shall expect you then in half an hour baron and Valentine will be	43.167572021484375
20940/28840	Scarcely had the door closed when	89.08607482910156
20941/28840	de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawingroom in half an hour as he expected the notary and	40.05641174316406
20942/28840	The news caused a great sensation throughout the house Madame de Villefort would not believe it and Valentine was thunderstru	49.34590148925781
20943/28840	She looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but on the stairs she met	54.11511993408203
20944/28840	de Villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing	19.90599250793457
20945/28840	In the anteroom Valentine met Barrois and looked despairingly at the old	43.988914489746094
20946/28840	A moment later Madame de Villefort entered the drawingroom with her little	45.097129821777344
20947/28840	It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatig	53.135868072509766
20948/28840	She sat down took Edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bos	64.02979278564453
20949/28840	Two carriages were soon heard to enter the	121.77598571777344
20950/28840	One was the notarys the other that of Franz and his	60.21749496459961
20951/28840	In a moment the whole party was	63.344566345214844
20952/28840	Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her	63.983036041259766
20953/28840	ChâteauRenaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to	31.65196990966797
20954/28840	Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her	51.900325775146484
20955/28840	The notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards Franz   Are you	76.6260986328125
20956/28840	Franz de Quesnel baron dÉpinay asked he although he knew it	58.981075286865234
20957/28840	I have then to inform you sir at the request of	52.27377700805664
20958/28840	de Villefort that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of	20.592273712158203
20959/28840	Noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left	44.43087387084961
20960/28840	Let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and	99.5374984741211
20961/28840	dÉpinay that during my lifetime my fathers will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be	156.83255004882812
20962/28840	40032m       Sir said Franz I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine I have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds	30.90717315673828
20963/28840	My family has sought consideration in this alliance with	470.4426574707031
20964/28840	de Villefort all I seek is	251.3480987548828
20965/28840	Valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her	80.03945922851562
20966/28840	Besides sir said Villefort addressing himself to his future soninlaw excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you	60.62698745727539
20967/28840	Noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains	189.4945068359375
20968/28840	It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same	48.668033599853516
20969/28840	Old age is selfish sir and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to	23.910070419311523
20970/28840	Noirtier which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness dÉpin	43.07073974609375
20971/28840	My fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married	84.41143035888672
20972/28840	Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended	84.28955841064453
20973/28840	de Villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and Barrois	32.98799133300781
20974/28840	Gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstancesgentlemen	266.5389404296875
20975/28840	Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to	28.069978713989258
20976/28840	He as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom	47.42680740356445
20977/28840	Villefort started Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees Valentine rose pale and dumb as a	43.83123016357422
20978/28840	Albert and ChâteauRenaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the	23.32239532470703
20979/28840	dÉpinay cannot leave the drawingroom at	72.46028137207031
20980/28840	It is at this moment replied Barrois with the same firmness that	30.56592559814453
20981/28840	Noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to	70.75228881835938
20982/28840	Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now then said Edward with his habitual quick	69.95323944091797
20983/28840	However his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the	110.15338897705078
20984/28840	Nortier resumed Villefort that what he demands is	139.0324249267578
20985/28840	Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied Barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing	74.68058013916016
20986/28840	Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame de Villeforts count	25.110496520996094
20987/28840	Valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank	73.13788604736328
20988/28840	de Villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers	79.71239471435547
20989/28840	Valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when	65.67147827148438
20990/28840	Stop said he I will go with	29.9041748046875
20991/28840	Excuse me sir said Franz since	186.12794494628906
20992/28840	Noirtier sent for me I am ready to attend to his wish besides I shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing	31.430784225463867
20993/28840	Pray sir said Villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb	42.52043151855469
20994/28840	40032m       Forgive me sir said Franz in a resolute	16.62666893005371
20995/28840	I would not lose this opportunity of proving to	63.856300354003906
20996/28840	Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which I am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my	75.7807388305664
20997/28840	And without listening to Villefort he arose and followed Valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling	41.59195327758789
20998/28840	ChâteauRenaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing	35.62738037109375
20999/28840	A Signed Statement   Noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his arm	38.75666809082031
21000/28840	When the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately	85.4648208618164
21001/28840	Listen whispered Villefort to Valentine who could not conceal her joy if	65.3553695678711
21002/28840	Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage I forbid you to understand	129.33547973632812
21003/28840	Franz dÉpinay said he you requested to see	61.74500274658203
21004/28840	We have all wished for this interview and I trust it will convince you how illformed are your objections to Valentines	87.1182632446289
21005/28840	Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villeforts blood run	89.0517578125
21006/28840	In a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a	66.92082977294922
21007/28840	Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the	45.61787796020508
21008/28840	She opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless	85.51080322265625
21009/28840	Shall I open the secretaire asked	159.77737426757812
21010/28840	Those at the side  	33.674617767333984
21011/28840	Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of	42.283016204833984
21012/28840	Is that what you wish for asked	119.9405746459961
21013/28840	She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was	164.04754638671875
21014/28840	But there are no more said	57.7158317565918
21015/28840	Noirtiers eye was fixed on the	25.263336181640625
21016/28840	Yes I understand grandfather said the young	47.98630142211914
21017/28840	40036m       She pointed to each letter of the	29.12166404724121
21018/28840	At the letter S the old man stopped	177.71470642089844
21019/28840	She opened and found the word	220.4741668701172
21020/28840	Ah is there a secret spring said	140.2533416748047
21021/28840	And who knows it Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone	36.376766204833984
21022/28840	Shall I call him  	46.89931106567383
21023/28840	Valentine went to the door and called Barro	22.021421432495117
21024/28840	Villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and Franz was stupef	35.17929458618164
21025/28840	Barrois said Valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you knowwill you open it   Barrois looked at the old	48.06440734863281
21026/28840	Barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black	139.37181091308594
21027/28840	Is that what you wish for said Barro	44.814979553222656
21028/28840	Shall I give these papers to	142.82815551757812
21029/28840	Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover read   To be given after my death to General Durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important	76.50048065185547
21030/28840	Well sir asked Franz what do you wish me to do with this paper   To preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procure	27.92727279663086
21031/28840	Do you wish him to read it said	54.4213752746582
21032/28840	You understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said	98.78351593017578
21033/28840	Then let us sit down said Villefort impatiently for it will take some	34.10421371459961
21034/28840	Villefort took a chair but Valentine remained standing by her fathers side and Franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his	69.1708755493164
21035/28840	February 5th 1815 said he it is the day my father was	56.44499206542969
21036/28840	Valentine and Villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly Go	40.47917938232422
21037/28840	But it was on leaving this club said he my father	102.5258560180664
21038/28840	had just granted to him with his estate of Épin	61.96772003173828
21039/28840	400340m       A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5	35.50043869018555
21040/28840	The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o	65.10550689697266
21041/28840	The meetings were always held from that time till	271.21630859375
21042/28840	General de Quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they	87.30294799804688
21043/28840	The generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he	86.7187271118164
21044/28840	What must be done then asked the	56.199012756347656
21045/28840	I have my carriage here said the	67.8204116821289
21046/28840	Have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know   Our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a StateCouncill	33.50846481323242
21047/28840	Then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being	340.12567138671875
21048/28840	We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came	80.28829956054688
21049/28840	When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no	64.0074462890625
21050/28840	On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his	66.33516693115234
21051/28840	The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue SaintJac	34.20053482055664
21052/28840	The general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly	71.48699188232422
21053/28840	The members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in	66.01866912841797
21054/28840	When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many wellknown faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been	60.242305755615234
21055/28840	And hence said Villefort arose my affection for your father my dear	51.63395690917969
21056/28840	Opinions held in common are a ready bond of	880.1159057617188
21057/28840	Franz continued   The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but	98.20439147949219
21058/28840	de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with	69.80074310302734
21059/28840	He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their	24.069028854370117

21062/28840	When the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brow	214.7875518798828
21063/28840	Well asked the president what do you say to this letter general   I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XV	52.10780334472656
21064/28840	to break my vow in behalf of the exem	91.44659423828125
21065/28840	This answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his	201.47695922851562
21066/28840	General said the president we acknowledge no King Louis XV	66.66727447509766
21067/28840	or an exemperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from France which is his kingdom by violence and	182.20310974121094
21068/28840	Excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge Louis XV	89.83682250976562
21069/28840	but I do as he has made me a baron and a fieldmarshal and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his happy return to	41.724796295166016

21072/28840	You would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what I should call becoming your accompl	111.5843505859375
21073/28840	You see I am more candid than	56.301902770996094
21074/28840	Ah my father said Franz interrupting	54.22743225097656
21075/28840	I understand now why they murdered	141.7165985107422
21076/28840	Valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to	90.89691162109375
21077/28840	Villefort walked to and fro behind	46.03034973144531

21079/28840	Franz returned to the manuscript and continued   Sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou	67.90564727783203
21080/28840	When you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XV	76.09424591064453
21081/28840	or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the	50.30949401855469
21082/28840	It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in	47.09651565551758
21083/28840	No no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the	98.9685287475586
21084/28840	I am a royalist replied the general I have taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XV	36.20733642578125
21085/28840	These words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rash	43.46914291381836
21086/28840	The president again arose and having imposed silence saidSir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer	89.96426391601562
21087/28840	The general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedIf you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by	161.72987365722656
21088/28840	And you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger I advise you not to touch your	52.714656829833984
21089/28840	The general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude saidI will not	87.39520263671875
21090/28840	Then you must die replied the president	240.32627868652344
21091/28840	dÉpinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their clo	70.293701171875
21092/28840	A significant silence followed these words and as the general did not replyClose the doors said the president to the door	69.09822082519531
21093/28840	40042m       The same deadly silence succeeded these	36.01054382324219
21094/28840	Then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelingsI have a son said he and I ought to think of him finding myself among	99.83943939208984
21095/28840	General said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyit is the privilege of	121.29561614990234
21096/28840	But he does wrong to use his	214.84112548828125
21097/28840	Follow my advice swear and do not	264.7989501953125
21098/28840	The general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskWhat is the form said	151.993408203125
21099/28840	It is thisI swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February 1815 between nine and ten oclock in the evening and I plead guilty of death should I ever violate this	46.421363830566406
21100/28840	Now am I at liberty to retire said the	102.9674301147461
21101/28840	The president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his	167.7340545654297
21102/28840	One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them	68.58621978759766
21103/28840	Where do you wish to be taken asked the	30.895645141601562
21104/28840	Anywhere out of your presence replied	209.3804473876953
21105/28840	Beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held	56.31556701660156
21106/28840	dÉpinay went onYou are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against	96.75233459472656
21107/28840	They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps lead down to the	84.97175598144531
21108/28840	Why do you stop here asked dÉpin	34.790855407714844
21109/28840	Because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable rep	93.88430786132812
21110/28840	Another method of assassination said the general shrugging his	38.46759033203125
21111/28840	Make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a	62.357234954833984
21112/28840	You are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side I have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve	78.53616333007812
21113/28840	Now if you please remove your band	142.5097198486328
21114/28840	The general tore the handkerchief from his	43.098670959472656
21115/28840	At last said he I shall know with whom I have to	39.52617263793945
21116/28840	They opened the door and the four men alight	39.85645294189453
21117/28840	Franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fathers death which had hitherto been a	131.76507568359375
21118/28840	Valentine clasped her hands as if in	42.53921890258789
21119/28840	Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and	20.46154022216797
21120/28840	Franz continued   It was as we said the fifth of	81.29652404785156
21121/28840	For three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with	54.99874496459961
21122/28840	The general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting	118.8853530883789
21123/28840	The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and	64.11995697021484
21124/28840	One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coalbarge near and by its light they examined the	113.8690185546875
21125/28840	The presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no	123.48081970214844
21126/28840	The general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own	92.80848693847656
21127/28840	The witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be	136.75648498535156
21128/28840	The lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel	64.17981719970703
21129/28840	The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so	90.73551940917969
21130/28840	40044m       General dÉpinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and	33.580230712890625
21131/28840	The witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to	86.54572296142578
21132/28840	The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his	174.62295532226562
21133/28840	But his opponent did not allow his guard to be	78.18904113769531
21134/28840	He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the	81.19552612304688
21135/28840	They thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with	83.16910552978516
21136/28840	The general who had almost fainted	150.0503692626953
21137/28840	Ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with	70.91775512695312
21138/28840	The president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third	90.95557403564453
21139/28840	Still he had not even uttered a	110.37552642822266
21140/28840	He had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterit was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was	48.70283126831055
21141/28840	The general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been	149.39291381835938
21142/28840	In proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of	92.1563949584961
21143/28840	Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door Valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfathers answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few	81.03984069824219
21144/28840	Mademoiselle said Franz turning towards Valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of	44.62868118286133
21145/28840	Hold sir said Villefort do not prolong this dreadful	45.616268157958984
21146/28840	The names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he cannot tell you proper names are not in the	153.5133819580078
21147/28840	Oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried Franz your grandfather says he can indicate the	41.45071792602539
21148/28840	Help melend me your assistance   Noirtier looked at the	60.10566711425781
21149/28840	Franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to	84.52662658691406
21150/28840	At that letter the old man signified	181.13465881347656
21151/28840	The young mans finger glided over the words but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative	142.5872039794922
21152/28840	Valentine hid her head between her	106.66097259521484
21153/28840	At length Franz arrived at the word MYS	92.26179504394531
21154/28840	40046m       Yes   You cried Franz whose hair stood on end you	38.5438117980957
21155/28840	Noirtieryou killed my father   Yes replied Noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young	30.282367706298828
21156/28840	Franz fell powerless on a chair Villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old	47.781890869140625
21157/28840	Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger   Meanwhile	61.493045806884766
21158/28840	Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria but at the gamingtable of the baths of Lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous court	68.53028869628906
21159/28840	He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of	98.86527252197266
21160/28840	Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva Corsin	32.079139709472656
21161/28840	He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be	98.19043731689453
21162/28840	Besides what is required of a young man in Paris To speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in	95.67567443847656
21163/28840	They are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a	467.25982666015625
21164/28840	Andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair	287.1609191894531
21165/28840	He was called count he was said to possess 50000 livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of Saravezza were a constant	52.19052505493164
21166/28840	A learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of	134.46786499023438
21167/28840	Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our readers when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay	81.706298828125
21168/28840	Danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the	30.06878089904785
21169/28840	It was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at Auteuil and the events which followed it that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristos name	56.23691940307617
21170/28840	If he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars soon dispelled every impression of	83.09553527832031
21171/28840	It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested enduseless injury is repugnant to every	160.18551635742188
21172/28840	40048m       When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with	30.5821533203125
21173/28840	Cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his	97.75852966308594
21174/28840	The latter took in the whole scene at a	154.14273071289062
21175/28840	The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa Eugénie sat near her and Cavalcanti was	42.45116424560547
21176/28840	This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle Danglars and by sighs launched in the same	31.682449340820312
21177/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars was still the samecold beautiful and	16.254905700683594
21178/28840	Not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sapp	139.05934143066406
21179/28840	Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly her singing	64.36726379394531
21180/28840	It was then especially while conversing with Madame Danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed	67.23851013183594
21181/28840	Andrea Cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his	119.19676208496094
21182/28840	His first look was certainly directed towards Monte Cristo but the second was for	96.29998016357422
21183/28840	As for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal	91.32228088378906
21184/28840	Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said Danglars to	58.95624542236328
21185/28840	Alas no sir replied Andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former	79.92385864257812
21186/28840	Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened	17.131057739257812
21187/28840	40050m       The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admir	45.98811340332031
21188/28840	Mademoiselle dArmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with Eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so	40.297725677490234
21189/28840	She was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins and her eyes dull from	91.61200714111328
21190/28840	She was said to have a weak chest and like Antonia in the _Cremona Violin_ she would die one day while	89.28466796875
21191/28840	Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle dArmilly of whom he had heard	34.017662048339844
21192/28840	The count soon heard Andreas voice singing a Corsican song accompanied by the	214.1353302001953
21193/28840	The praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the barons countenance would not have led him to suspect	62.7497673034668
21194/28840	Hem thought Monte Cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of	111.53860473632812
21195/28840	Danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses	46.12806701660156
21196/28840	I see that you participate in a prevalent error said Madame Dangl	25.155315399169922
21197/28840	Debray told meapropos what has become of him I have seen nothing of him the last three or four	48.201805114746094
21198/28840	Nor I said Madame Danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not	59.79704284667969
21199/28840	Debray had told you   Ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of	41.261131286621094
21200/28840	I was once very fond of it but I do not indulge	58.42103958129883
21201/28840	Fortune is precarious and if I were a woman and fate had made me a bankers wife whatever might be my confidence in my husbands good fortune still in speculation you know there is great	122.32304382324219
21202/28840	Well I would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if I acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to	153.00088500976562
21203/28840	Madame Danglars blushed in spite of all her	28.736637115478516
21204/28840	Stay said Monte Cristo as though he had not observed her confusion I have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the Neapolitan	67.1768569946289

21210/28840	His father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but I do not think he has much claim to that	48.8560905456543
21211/28840	If he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank I do not like anyone to deny his	58.9036979675293
21212/28840	Oh you are a thorough democrat said Monte Cristo	21.458250045776367
21213/28840	But do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baron	29.9190731048584

21218/28840	Albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like Eugénie	95.6734390258789
21219/28840	Besides I care not for his	208.01622009277344
21220/28840	Still situated as we are   Yes do you know how we are situated At his mothers ball he danced once with Eugénie and	89.93303680419922
21221/28840	Cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of	219.6195526123047
21222/28840	The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcer	16.549827575683594
21223/28840	The baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when Danglars stopped	46.34162139892578
21224/28840	Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what	132.32809448242188
21225/28840	Albert entered looking very handsome and in high	272.7716369628906
21226/28840	He bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to Danglars and affectionately to Monte Crist	23.434101104736328
21227/28840	Then turning to the baroness May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is said	15.690183639526367
21228/28840	She is quite well replied Danglars quickly she is at the piano with	38.81589889526367
21229/28840	Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew Monte Cristos eye was on	137.6977081298828
21230/28840	Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and Mademoiselle Eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like Thal	110.2525405883789
21231/28840	The concert must be a delightful	202.1643829345703
21232/28840	They suit each other remarkably well said Dangl	36.020626068115234
21233/28840	Albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that Madame Danglars bl	47.121822357177734
21234/28840	I too said the young man am a musicianat least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than	73.50271606445312
21235/28840	Danglars smiled and seemed to say It is of no	24.30207061767578
21236/28840	Then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he saidThe prince and my daughter were universally admired	242.198486328125
21237/28840	You were not of the party	77.32134246826172
21238/28840	de Morcerf   What prince asked	52.588539123535156
21239/28840	Prince Cavalcanti said Danglars who persisted in giving the young man that	35.10785675048828
21240/28840	Pardon me said Albert I was not aware that he was a	27.404077529907227
21241/28840	And Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugénie yesterday It must have been charming	40.90318298339844
21242/28840	But I was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of ChâteauRen	45.951446533203125
21243/28840	This was followed by rather an awkward	219.00045776367188
21244/28840	Bravo bravi brava The banker was enthusiastic in his	652.4971923828125
21245/28840	40054m       Indeed said Albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti	27.49224090576172
21246/28840	You said prince did you not But he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in	106.37227630615234
21247/28840	But to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat Danglars without telling them there is a	60.96771240234375
21248/28840	Ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by	105.02342224121094
21249/28840	Danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans	24.569690704345703
21250/28840	What do you think of our lover said	39.09276580810547
21251/28840	Yes doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does	40.62676239013672
21252/28840	See him there cold as marble and proud like his	335.1914978027344
21253/28840	If he were rich if he had Cavalcantis fortune that might be pard	59.67325210571289
21254/28840	Why do you doubt   The pastthat obscurity on the	117.45728302001953
21255/28840	But that does not affect the	97.4434585571289
21256/28840	Now I beg of you dont go off your	86.85839080810547
21257/28840	Its a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young Cavalcanti whom I do not really know at	45.43047332763672
21258/28840	Have you made inquiry   Is there any need of that Does not his appearance speak for him And he is very	111.11498260498047
21259/28840	I am not so sure of	22.52924156188965
21260/28840	And yet you said he had	263.8498840332031
21261/28840	Hem said Monte Cristo in his	24.61651039123535
21262/28840	Come count you do not do that young man	148.70550537109375
21263/28840	Well I acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the Morcerf family to see him throw himself in the	88.30606079101562
21264/28840	What a Puritan you are said he that happens every	87.50249481201172
21265/28840	But you cannot break it off in this way the Morcerfs are depending on this	61.38907241821289
21266/28840	Then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the	130.89947509765625
21267/28840	Iwhere the devil did you find out that   At their ball it was apparent	88.60021209716797
21268/28840	But let it be done explicitly and	109.57994079589844
21269/28840	If he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or	131.1070556640625
21270/28840	Yes sir I will give my attention to the	36.763553619384766
21271/28840	I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision but I do await	64.01862335205078
21272/28840	A banker must you know be a slave to his	153.72691345214844
21273/28840	Cavalcanti had done half an hour	424.43255615234375
21274/28840	Bravi bravo brava cried Morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an	111.28524780273438
21275/28840	Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to	29.47579574584961
21276/28840	I shall soon return said the banker to Monte Cristo wait for	64.78792572021484
21277/28840	I shall perhaps have something to say to	25.902585983276367
21278/28840	The baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and	63.31370162963867
21279/28840	Andrea who was sitting before the piano with Mademoiselle Eugénie started up like a jackinthe	53.87622833251953
21280/28840	Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual cool	22.43290138244629
21281/28840	Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to Morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look	130.12777709960938
21282/28840	Then Albert launched out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous	33.84457778930664
21283/28840	Cavalcanti being left alone turned to Monte Crist	291.9474182128906
21284/28840	Come said Madame Danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take	30.465415954589844
21285/28840	Come Louise said Mademoiselle Danglars to her	17.98271369934082
21286/28840	They passed into the next drawingroom where tea was	113.7151870727539
21287/28840	Just as they were beginning in the English fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and Danglars entered visibly	40.412960052490234
21288/28840	Monte Cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an	160.53802490234375
21289/28840	I have just received my courier from Greece said Dangl	28.56403160095215
21290/28840	Ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from	46.81833267211914
21291/28840	How is King Otho getting on asked Albert in the most sprightly	115.77790069580078
21292/28840	Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a	42.434715270996094
21293/28840	We shall go together shall we not said Albert to the	78.36969757080078
21294/28840	I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo while the father talks to	22.318330764770508
21295/28840	If you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said Monte Crist	65.42147064208984
21296/28840	My dear viscount you are dreadfully impert	35.3944091796875
21297/28840	Meanwhile Danglars stooping to Monte Cristos ear Your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yan	66.13228607177734
21298/28840	Yes I will tell you all but take away the young man I cannot endure his	40.163997650146484
21299/28840	Shall I send the father to you  	81.07868194580078
21300/28840	Haydée   Scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when Albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughtermuch too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and	48.20159912109375
21301/28840	Well said he I will ask you the same question which Charles	50.53898239135742
21302/28840	put to Catherine de Medici after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew How have I played my little part   To what do you allude asked Monte Crist	47.18428421020508
21303/28840	To the installation of my rival at	120.35920715332031
21304/28840	What rival   _Ma foi_ what rival Why your protégé	55.426353454589844
21305/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti   Ah no joking viscount if you please I do not patronize	43.66925048828125
21306/28840	And you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with	72.10892486572266
21307/28840	What do you think he is paying his addresses   I am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his	41.017852783203125
21308/28840	He aspires to the hand of the proud Eugé	46.487403869628906
21309/28840	What does that signify so long as they favor your suit   But it is not the case my dear count on the	42.11652374267578
21310/28840	What   It is so indeed Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely answers me and Mademoiselle dArmilly her confidant does not speak to me at	16.217077255249023
21311/28840	But the father has the greatest regard possible for you said Monte Crist	64.53980255126953
21312/28840	He Oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedyweapons I own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and	115.40337371826172
21313/28840	Of whomof Debray   No of	61.01118850708008
21314/28840	Of me I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against	92.55101776123047
21315/28840	Do you wish me to do so  	13.879790306091309
21316/28840	Well I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the bar	30.02213478088379
21317/28840	By whom are you charged   By the baron	75.78656005859375
21318/28840	Oh said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was	39.91962814331055
21319/28840	You surely will not do that my dear count   Certainly I shall Albert as I have promised to do	38.46642303466797
21320/28840	Well said Albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry	33.95637512207031
21321/28840	I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said Monte Crist	29.937767028808594
21322/28840	But apropos of Debray how is it that I have not seen him lately at the barons house   There has been a	29.446443557739258
21323/28840	What with the baroness   No with the bar	23.900346755981445
21324/28840	Has he perceived anything   Ah that is a good joke   Do you think he suspects said Monte Cristo with charming art	41.20539855957031
21325/28840	Where have you come from my dear count said	27.429550170898438
21326/28840	It must be farther off than even	345.5927734375
21327/28840	But what do I know of your Parisian husbands   Oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole	98.64790344238281
21328/28840	But then what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray They seemed to understand each other so well said Monte Cristo with renewed	35.173072814941406
21329/28840	Ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis in which I am not	49.91756820678711
21330/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that	83.76771545410156
21331/28840	Here we are said Monte Cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come	23.8924560546875
21332/28840	No thank you I gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow	30.675960540771484
21333/28840	There it is then said Monte Cristo as he stepped out of the	19.64425277709961
21334/28840	They both went into the house the drawingroom was lighted upthey went in	84.61845397949219
21335/28840	You will make tea for us Baptistin said the	47.41790771484375
21336/28840	Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy	108.40125274658203
21337/28840	What you say is perhaps true they know my	207.78948974609375
21338/28840	For instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime   _Ma foi_ I should like to	41.150638580322266
21339/28840	Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it	106.256591796875
21340/28840	In about the space of a second a private door opened and Ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent lat	60.09537887573242
21341/28840	Oh no it is as simple as possible replied Monte Crist	37.55659484863281
21342/28840	Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youAh but what do I hear and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a	83.66507720947266
21343/28840	_Ma foi_ my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars piano to be attacked by Haydées guz	24.448719024658203
21344/28840	Haydéewhat an adorable name Are there then really women who bear the name of Haydée anywhere but in Byrons poems   Certainly there	96.65066528320312
21345/28840	Haydée is a very uncommon name in France but is common enough in Albania and Epirus it is as if you said for example Chastity Modesty Innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you Parisians call	79.44943237304688
21346/28840	And you think she would be angry   No certainly not said the count with a haughty	25.25206756591797
21347/28840	She is very amiable then is she not said	161.60252380371094
21348/28840	It is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a	100.64307403564453
21349/28840	Are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name   Und	97.64219665527344
21350/28840	Really count you do nothing and have nothing like other	190.86692810058594
21351/28840	The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo Why it is a rank of itself in France and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a	34.39493179321289
21352/28840	A hundred thousand francs The poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the _Thousand and One Nights_ would seem but	45.09333419799805
21353/28840	You are right and she is one of the greatest in her country	61.41536331176758
21354/28840	You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina do you not   Of Ali Tepelini13 Oh yes it was in his service that my father made his	24.779075622558594
21355/28840	40062m       Well what is Haydée to Ali Tepelini   Merely his	13.184601783752441
21356/28840	What the daughter of Ali Pasha   Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasil	22.50946044921875
21357/28840	And your slave   _Ma foi_	13.456879615783691
21358/28840	But how did she become so   Why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as I was passing through the market at	70.21406555175781
21359/28840	Wonderful Really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when I listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking	130.84873962402344
21360/28840	Now I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but   Say	60.15925979614258
21361/28840	But since you go out with Haydée and sometimes even take her to the Opera   Well   I think I may venture to ask you this	32.32566833496094
21362/28840	You may venture to ask me	47.258602142333984
21363/28840	Well then my dear count present me to your	107.14232635498047
21364/28840	I will do so but on two	95.15291595458984
21365/28840	The first is that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the	111.78614807128906
21366/28840	Very well said Albert extending his hand I swear I will	57.03251647949219
21367/28840	The second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served	101.77811431884766
21368/28840	I give you my oath that I will	31.022119522094727
21369/28840	Enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not But I know you to be a man of	49.32195281982422
21370/28840	Tell Haydée said he that I will take coffee with her and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my friends to	49.633358001708984
21371/28840	Now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear Morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and I will ask	40.34886169433594
21372/28840	Ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass	39.22226333618164
21373/28840	Let us go in said Monte Crist	35.86134338378906
21374/28840	Albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and	59.51533889770508
21375/28840	Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three French attendants commanded by Myrth	105.06073760986328
21376/28840	Haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawing	76.55908203125
21377/28840	Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except Monte Cristo had been accorded an entrance into her	53.72119140625
21378/28840	She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped	56.33490753173828
21379/28840	Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its	88.81707000732422
21380/28840	On perceiving Monte Cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest	50.92628479003906
21381/28840	Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her	67.06074523925781
21382/28840	Whom do you bring asked the young girl in Romaic of Monte Cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an	69.73284149169922
21383/28840	A friend said Monte Cristo in the same	19.612890243530273
21384/28840	What is his name   Count Albert it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the banditti at	29.287582397460938
21385/28840	In what language would you like me to converse with him   Monte Cristo turned to	18.660539627075195
21386/28840	Do you know modern Greek asked	178.26612854003906
21387/28840	Alas no said Albert nor even ancient Greek my dear count never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than	144.30245971679688
21388/28840	Then said Haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristos question and Alberts answer then I will speak either in French or Italian if my lord so wills	97.69473266601562
21389/28840	You will speak in Italian said	75.53693389892578
21390/28840	The count made a sign to Haydée to address his	38.764774322509766
21391/28840	Sir she said to Morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and	31.242307662963867
21392/28840	This was said in excellent Tuscan and with that soft Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of	86.31431579589844
21393/28840	Then turning to Ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to	52.63774871826172
21394/28840	Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of	70.45057678222656
21395/28840	Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to	90.84249114990234
21396/28840	Baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to	200.791015625
21397/28840	Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered	99.03878021240234
21398/28840	Oh take ittake it said the count Haydée is almost as civilized as a Parisian the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume you	59.45713424682617
21399/28840	The cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for	146.6600341796875
21400/28840	Monte Cristo and Haydée took the beverage in the original Arabian manner that is to say without	78.30686950683594
21401/28840	Haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it	94.91749572753906
21402/28840	At this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that	166.09767150878906
21403/28840	My dear host and you signora said Albert in Italian excuse my apparent	155.0830078125
21404/28840	I am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be	23.90593719482422
21405/28840	Oh signora if I could but speak Greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to	91.76223754882812
21406/28840	I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you sir said Haydée quietly and if you like what is Eastern I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are	51.16897964477539
21407/28840	On what subject shall I converse with her said Albert in a low tone to Monte Crist	31.053983688354492
21408/28840	Just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of Rome Naples or	87.50086975097656
21409/28840	Oh said Albert it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian let me speak to her of the	73.34551239013672
21410/28840	Do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her	113.63729095458984
21411/28840	At what age did you leave Greece signora asked	138.75869750976562
21412/28840	I left it when I was but five years old replied Hayd	35.64421081542969
21413/28840	And have you any recollection of your country   When I shut my eyes and think I seem to see it all	55.94559860229492
21414/28840	The mind can see as well as the	92.96306610107422
21415/28840	The body forgets sometimes but the mind always	301.92620849609375
21416/28840	Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the	90.35536193847656
21417/28840	And how old were you at that time   I was three years old said Hayd	38.839271545410156
21418/28840	Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old said	110.52610778808594
21419/28840	Count said Albert in a low tone to Monte Cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her	37.78474044799805
21420/28840	You prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful	76.146728515625
21421/28840	Haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful	90.24689483642578
21422/28840	What are you saying to her said Morcerf in an undert	18.829788208007812
21423/28840	I again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from	60.87161636352539
21424/28840	Then from time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either Kill or P	84.60231018066406
21425/28840	It is very strange said Albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self This is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe	80.80696105957031
21426/28840	Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest	61.97903823852539
21427/28840	40068m       Speak speak signora said Albert I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you	36.87734603881836
21428/28840	Haydée answered his remark with a melancholy	95.7947769165039
21429/28840	You wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said	61.873619079589844
21430/28840	I beg you to do so replied	22.356101989746094
21431/28840	Well I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my	79.81098175048828
21432/28840	We were in the palace of Yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which I was sleeping and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with	57.304569244384766
21433/28840	When I saw her weeping I began to cry	228.3698272705078
21434/28840	I saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest	83.59071350097656
21435/28840	Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a	170.32489013671875
21436/28840	Here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pinetorches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof	145.9364776611328
21437/28840	Quick said a voice at the end of the	26.209192276000977
21438/28840	This voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obe	201.87759399414062
21439/28840	As for me it made me trem	68.8118667602539
21440/28840	This voice was that of my	62.38174057006836
21441/28840	He came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented	136.43896484375
21442/28840	He was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite Selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling	90.60404205322266
21443/28840	My father said Haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and before whom Turkey tremb	37.35293960571289
21444/28840	Soon said Haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a	52.959083557128906
21445/28840	My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces I saw my father who was glancing anxiously	52.760353088378906
21446/28840	Four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating on the	104.46776580810547
21447/28840	40070m       From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were	38.42305374145508
21448/28840	This kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discern	62.808082580566406
21449/28840	I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palik	53.57219696044922
21450/28840	14 Besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother Selim and	294.36956787109375
21451/28840	The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of	69.4785385131836
21452/28840	Why does the boat go so fast asked I of my	334.9255065917969
21453/28840	Silence child Hush we are flying I did not	241.653076171875
21454/28840	Why should my father flyhe the allpowerfulhe before whom others were accustomed to flyhe who had taken for his device   They hate me then they fear me     It was indeed a flight which my father was trying to	90.55985260009766
21455/28840	I have been told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina fatigued with long service   Here Haydée cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her	28.782468795776367
21456/28840	The young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is	109.92796325683594
21457/28840	And this officer asked Albert do you remember his name signora   Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by	34.5411262512207
21458/28840	No said she I do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently I will tell	25.50058937072754
21459/28840	Albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was	32.955501556396484
21460/28840	It was towards this kiosk that we were ro	127.89830017089844
21461/28840	A ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the	67.5482406616211
21462/28840	But beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were	64.11955261230469
21463/28840	In this place were together 60000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 25000000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30000 pounds of gun	89.93085479736328
21464/28840	Near the barrels stood Selim my fathers favorite whom I mentioned to you just	197.13999938964844
21465/28840	He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everythingkiosk guards women gold and Ali Tepelini himselfat the first signal given by my	117.9581527709961
21466/28840	I remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and gro	102.03230285644531
21467/28840	As for me I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world I am quite sure I shall recognize Sel	67.6539077758789
21468/28840	I cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period I did not even know what time	45.06386184692383
21469/28840	Sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selims fiery l	78.75765228271484
21470/28840	One morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than	115.68016815185547
21471/28840	Take courage Vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be	107.5257797241211
21472/28840	If my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to Yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this	139.39141845703125
21473/28840	But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my	62.09828186035156
21474/28840	Oh make yourself easy on that head said Ali smiling Selim and his flaming lance will settle that	174.1627655029297
21475/28840	They would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with	57.40877151489258
21476/28840	My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fathers	147.8751678466797
21477/28840	Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with	143.12472534179688
21478/28840	Then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his	71.98675537109375
21479/28840	My mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she	105.77367401123047
21480/28840	A boattwothree murmured my fatherfour He then arose seizing his arms and priming his	158.88612365722656
21481/28840	Vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide	137.4120635986328
21482/28840	In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors	36.45590591430664
21483/28840	I will not quit you said Vasiliki if you die my lord I will die with	28.383201599121094
21484/28840	Adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of	105.7152328491211
21485/28840	Take away Vasiliki said my father to his Palik	59.252872467041016
21486/28840	As for me I had been forgotten in the general confusion I ran toward Ali Tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his	46.01640319824219
21487/28840	Oh how distinctly I remember that kissit was the last he ever gave me and I feel as if it were still warm on my	84.55867004394531
21488/28840	On descending we saw through the latticework several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our	173.8131561279297
21489/28840	At first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the	115.0257797241211
21490/28840	During this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty Palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the	85.52784729003906
21491/28840	They were armed with their long guns inlaid with motherofpearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the	55.14714813232422
21492/28840	My father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest	57.77045822143555
21493/28840	This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last	97.50824737548828
21494/28840	My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the	88.46435546875
21495/28840	Selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we	103.07456970214844
21496/28840	We fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by Sel	33.58408737182617
21497/28840	In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as I was I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our	121.9669418334961
21498/28840	Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and	21.214448928833008
21499/28840	Go on my child said the count in the Romaic	37.00484085083008
21500/28840	40074m       Haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristos voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her	31.4752197265625
21501/28840	It was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the	40.906585693359375
21502/28840	One single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was Selims flaming l	133.72300720214844
21503/28840	My mother was a Christian and she	320.05633544921875
21504/28840	Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words God is great However my mother had still some	251.220703125
21505/28840	As she was coming down she thought she recognized the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and	59.4119873046875
21506/28840	She advanced some steps towards the staircase and	114.89225006103516
21507/28840	They are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty   What do you fear Vasiliki said Selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so	57.82949447631836
21508/28840	If they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them	63.53714370727539
21509/28840	And he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of old Cre	141.9896697998047
21510/28840	16 But I being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited	151.61329650878906
21511/28840	My mother experienced the same sensations for I felt her trem	158.317626953125
21512/28840	Mamma mamma said I are we really to be killed And at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lament	67.31499481201172
21513/28840	My child said Vasiliki may God preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread Then whispering to Selim she asked what were her masters	165.24868774414062
21514/28840	Suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of	147.47610473632812
21515/28840	The name of the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was	37.992942810058594
21516/28840	And do you not remember the Frenchmans name said Morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the	55.359317779541016
21517/28840	Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be	31.0830135345459
21518/28840	I do not recollect it said Hayd	12.242156028747559
21519/28840	The noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the	131.28466796875
21520/28840	Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy	79.35526275634766
21521/28840	But whoever you may be I charge you not to advance another	155.0474395751953
21522/28840	Long live the emperor said the	296.6678466796875
21523/28840	He grants a full pardon to the Vizier Ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his	123.27649688720703
21524/28840	My mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bos	36.64437484741211
21525/28840	Stop said Selim seeing that she was about to go out you see I have not yet received the ringTrue said my	47.31584167480469
21526/28840	And she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to God in my behalf to raise me actually to his	76.59917449951172
21527/28840	And for the second time Haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and	70.29507446289062

21556/28840	At the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round	98.64767456054688
21557/28840	Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with	87.29757690429688

21588/28840	Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of	40.97572326660156
21589/28840	dÉpinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that	68.8499984741211

21596/28840	Determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden	66.49177551269531
21597/28840	de Villeforts communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between	49.92693328857422
21598/28840	dÉpinay and himself and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken	80.34479522705078
21599/28840	This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were	106.07111358642578
21600/28840	She therefore contented herself with saying that	78.52216339111328

21615/28840	Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry	59.71028137207031
21616/28840	During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed Madame de Villefort had gone to visit	45.00617218017578
21617/28840	The old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive	32.120235443115234
21618/28840	Sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentines marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was	39.936641693115234
21619/28840	But one thing I can tell you of which I do not think you are aware that is that I have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approb	36.64739227294922

21623/28840	Noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her	100.1212387084961
21624/28840	There was a doubtful expression in Noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing	47.43025588989258
21625/28840	May I hope sir said Madame de Villefort that your intentions accord with my request   Noirtier made a sign that they	31.04838752746582

21629/28840	de Villefort Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to	20.310514450073242
21630/28840	Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best	62.96142578125
21631/28840	At the first sight of his old friend Danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy	41.468265533447266

21637/28840	And Morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to	36.783203125
21638/28840	Danglars said   Baron I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son the Vicomte Albert de Morcer	13.9125394821167
21639/28840	I do not understand you baron said Morcer	10.757100105285645

21641/28840	Well in one of your late conversations with him you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not   I did say	75.14827728271484
21642/28840	Well here I am proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that	60.65202713012695
21643/28840	Danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just	32.22104263305664
21644/28840	I am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the	36.51858139038086
21645/28840	What do you mean to say   I mean to say that I have a good reason but that it is difficult to	16.33017349243164
21646/28840	You must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my	64.07615661621094
21647/28840	No sir said Danglars I merely suspend my decision that is	22.454071044921875
21648/28840	A cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned	191.14598083496094
21649/28840	My dear Danglars said Morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others	30.082096099853516
21650/28840	You owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your	68.81747436523438
21651/28840	It is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all I can say sir replied Danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed	36.18739318847656
21652/28840	And towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said Morcerf turning pale with	53.98353576660156
21653/28840	The expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said   You may perhaps be better satisfied that I should not go farther into	49.285362243652344
21654/28840	A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said I have a right to insist on your giving me an	62.557701110839844
21655/28840	No do not seek any longer to discover the	58.14387893676758

21660/28840	Enough sir said Morcerf we will speak no more on the	31.984235763549805
21661/28840	And clutching his gloves in anger he left the	158.38845825195312

21665/28840	The next morning as soon as he awoke Danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on _lImpartial_ the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief	43.10538101196289
21666/28840	He hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed   _We hear from Yan	107.23499298095703

21672/28840	My good friend said Albert I beg pardon for my intrusion but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or	63.764930725097656
21673/28840	He is really out sir replied Baptist	110.23645782470703
21674/28840	Out even to me   I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said Baptistin and I should therefore never think of including him in any general	69.44928741455078
21675/28840	You are right and now I wish to see him on an affair of great	35.99146270751953
21676/28840	Do you think it will be long before he comes in   No I think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten o	41.51018524169922
21677/28840	Albert left the cab in which he had come at the counts door intending to take a turn on	55.92618179321289
21678/28840	As he was passing the Allée des Veuves he thought he saw the counts horses standing at Gossets shootinggallery he approached and soon recognized the coach	97.14736938476562
21679/28840	Is the count shooting in the gallery said Morcer	67.41399383544922
21680/28840	While he was speaking Albert had heard the report of two or three pistol	58.429927825927734
21681/28840	He entered and on his way met the	140.70523071289062
21682/28840	Excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment   What for Philip asked Albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his	86.62016296386719
21683/28840	Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of	65.253173828125
21684/28840	Not even before you Philip Then who loads his pistol   His	191.11016845703125
21685/28840	Do you know this gentleman   Yes and I am come to look for him he is a friend of	20.984350204467773
21686/28840	Oh that is quite another thing	81.63856506347656
21687/28840	I will go immediately and inform him of your	49.743858337402344
21688/28840	And Philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards Monte Cristo appeared on the	67.20646667480469
21689/28840	I ask your pardon my dear count said Albert for following you here and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so I alone am to blame for the indisc	39.50572204589844
21690/28840	I went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to	55.579246520996094
21691/28840	I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten oclock when I caught sight of your carriage and	57.24833297729492
21692/28840	What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with	49.25174331665039
21693/28840	40092m       No thank you I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse	72.35960388183594
21694/28840	What on earth are you talking of   I am to fight	55.06209182739258
21695/28840	For what   For the sake of fighting   Yes I understand that but what is the quarrel People fight for all sorts of reasons you	46.932273864746094
21696/28840	I fight in the cause of	68.74722290039062
21697/28840	So serious that I come to beg you to render me a	51.1983757019043
21698/28840	What is it   To be my	33.27690887451172
21699/28840	That is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get	60.963436126708984
21700/28840	The count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after	82.5899887084961
21701/28840	Come in my lord said Philip in a low tone and I will show you something d	40.73796463012695
21702/28840	Morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed against the	53.20224380493164
21703/28840	At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the	110.87576293945312
21704/28840	Ah ha said Albert I see you were preparing for a game of	95.1466064453125
21705/28840	No said the count I was making a	47.070037841796875
21706/28840	Those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and	386.4756774902344
21707/28840	In fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with	141.65188598632812
21708/28840	In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts	48.930660247802734
21709/28840	What would you have my dear viscount said Monte Cristo wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or	38.04950714111328
21710/28840	But come I am waiting for	45.6422119140625
21711/28840	Both men entered Monte Cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at	94.82195281982422
21712/28840	Monte Cristo took Albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for	87.5052490234375
21713/28840	Now let us talk the matter over quietly said the	131.6311798095703
21714/28840	You see I am perfectly composed said	114.96283721923828
21715/28840	With whom are you going to fight   With Beauch	26.774030685424805
21716/28840	One of your friends   Of course it is always with friends that one	56.76759719848633
21717/28840	I suppose you have some cause of quarrel   I	24.57430648803711
21718/28840	40094m       What has he done to you   There appeared in his journal last nightbut wait and read for	42.1337776184082
21719/28840	And Albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows   A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in	75.55721282958984
21720/28840	The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand in whom the grand vizier Ali Tepelini had reposed the greatest	43.968544006347656
21721/28840	Oh my dear viscount do talk reason   I do not desire to do	54.773433685302734
21722/28840	They have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high	85.21456146240234
21723/28840	I inherit my fathers name and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken	95.49736785888672
21724/28840	I am going to Beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two	69.53882598876953
21725/28840	No you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same	79.60979461669922
21726/28840	I will efface that blot on my fathers	88.10812377929688
21727/28840	My father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant   Oh well he will add We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf who also bears the same Christian	67.33817291259766
21728/28840	I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retract	61.84860610961914
21729/28840	And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you  	40.640750885009766
21730/28840	Which means I suppose that you refuse the service which I asked of you   You know my theory regarding duels I told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at	69.65679931640625
21731/28840	Nevertheless my dear count I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to	95.71875
21732/28840	Because my dear fellow you understand one must never be	101.52306365966797
21733/28840	If ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study	401.4951171875
21734/28840	You admit that you would fight then Well if so why do you object to my doing so   I do not say that you ought not to fight I only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due	48.12336730957031
21735/28840	Did he reflect before he insulted my father   If he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be	70.68366241455078
21736/28840	Ah my dear count you are far too indul	40.062171936035156
21737/28840	Supposing for instance and do not be angry at what I am going to say  	32.241310119628906
21738/28840	Supposing the assertion to be really true   A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers	78.41182708740234
21739/28840	_Ma foi_ we live in times when there is much to which we must	110.01596069335938
21740/28840	That is precisely the fault of the	54.92457962036133
21741/28840	And do you undertake to reform it   Yes as far as I am personally	42.43102264404297
21742/28840	Well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow   Yes I own	41.333824157714844
21743/28840	Are you quite impervious to good advice   Not when it comes from a	74.01342010498047
21744/28840	And do you account me that title   Certainly I	73.99856567382812
21745/28840	Well then before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the	119.67703247070312
21746/28840	You reject this means of information then   I domost	165.82086181640625
21747/28840	Then let me offer one more word of	327.130126953125
21748/28840	Do so then but let it be the	87.1785659790039
21749/28840	You do not wish to hear it perhaps   On the contrary I request	20.583919525146484
21750/28840	Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchampvisit him	95.70387268066406
21751/28840	That would be contrary to all	121.20801544189453
21752/28840	Your case is not an ordinary	184.45249938964844
21753/28840	And what is your reason for advising me to go alone   Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauch	52.852928161621094
21754/28840	If Beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free willthe satisfaction to you will be the	70.09725189208984
21755/28840	If on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your	84.0904769897461
21756/28840	They will not be strangers they will be	185.30966186523438
21757/28840	Ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow Beauchamp for	97.48319244384766
21758/28840	So you recommend   I recommend you to be	66.81169128417969
21759/28840	Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp   I do and I will tell you	23.31539535522461
21760/28840	When you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound	99.33697509765625
21761/28840	Go but you would do better still by not going at	133.43630981445312
21762/28840	Do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you	112.12528991699219
21763/28840	Why   Perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my	60.10652542114258
21764/28840	Well I will have Franz and ChâteauRenaud they will be the very men for	33.452693939208984
21765/28840	But if I do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing   That too is	102.2146224975586
21766/28840	What a singular being you areyou will not interfere in	147.95986938476562
21767/28840	You are rightthat is the principle on which I wish to	45.80152130126953
21768/28840	We will say no more about it	46.50679397583008
21769/28840	Morcerf took his hat and left the	32.31499481201172
21770/28840	He found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp who was in his	61.08110809326172
21771/28840	It was a gloomy dustylooking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immem	184.59857177734375
21772/28840	Beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be	42.096412658691406
21773/28840	Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the	71.67044830322266
21774/28840	This way this way my dear Albert said he holding out his hand to the young	32.6801643371582
21775/28840	Beauchamp said Albert it is of your journal that I come to	60.01946258544922
21776/28840	Indeed What do you wish to say about it   I desire that a statement contained in it should be rect	33.64113235473633
21777/28840	To what do you refer But pray sit	128.09158325195312
21778/28840	Thank you said Albert with a cold and formal	95.58525085449219
21779/28840	Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you   An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my	41.479862213134766
21780/28840	What is it said Beauchamp much surprised surely you must be	50.28363800048828
21781/28840	Yanina   Yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me	54.06407928466797
21782/28840	Such is really the case I assure you upon my honor Baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried Beauch	95.81510925292969
21783/28840	Here I have brought mine with me replied	132.2515106201172
21784/28840	Beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undert	75.63323211669922
21785/28840	You see it is a serious annoyance said Morcerf when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the	33.3598518371582
21786/28840	Is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the	150.9473419189453
21787/28840	Well what do you wish me to do for you said Beauchamp	16.54366111755371
21788/28840	My dear Beauchamp I wish you to contradict this	45.3459587097168
21789/28840	Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent	60.752235412597656
21790/28840	Come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you	101.93270111083984
21791/28840	Sit down and I will read it	91.32205963134766
21792/28840	Albert resumed his seat and Beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his	94.33894348144531
21793/28840	Well said Albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and I insist on a retractation being	62.32456588745117
21794/28840	You insist   Yes I	79.93437957763672
21795/28840	Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber my dear vis	29.136728286743164
21796/28840	Nor do I wish to be there replied the young man	36.443599700927734
21797/28840	I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday	43.561012268066406
21798/28840	You have known me long enough continued Albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that Beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this	53.09080123901367
21799/28840	If I have been your friend Morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that	81.19513702392578
21800/28840	But wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not	76.9494857788086
21801/28840	You are irritated and vexedtell me how this Fernand is related to you   He is merely my father said Albert	62.1766242980957
21802/28840	Fernand Mondego Count of Morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of	57.77772903442383
21803/28840	Is it your father said Beauchamp that is quite another	38.801021575927734
21804/28840	Then I can well understand your indignation my dear	136.14450073242188
21805/28840	I will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he	100.2570571899414
21806/28840	But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your	140.11412048339844
21807/28840	40100m       No but the connection will be seen by others and therefore I will have the article	35.252685546875
21808/28840	At the words _I will_ Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Alberts countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few	63.1246337890625
21809/28840	You will retract this assertion will you not Beauchamp said Albert with increased though stifled	84.74075317382812
21810/28840	When I am convinced that the statement is	69.57345581054688
21811/28840	What   The thing is worth looking into and I will take pains to investigate the matter	99.65357208251953
21812/28840	But what is there to investigate sir said Albert enraged beyond measure at Beauchamps last	157.4856414794922
21813/28840	If you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing	64.65121459960938
21814/28840	Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his	52.49919128417969
21815/28840	Sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half	53.02541732788086
21816/28840	Am I to put this construction on your visit   Yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calum	81.56090545654297
21817/28840	Wait a momentno threats if you please	175.9076385498047
21818/28840	Fernand Mondego Vicomte de Morcerf I never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my	37.90437316894531
21819/28840	And if I refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said Beauchamp in a calm	53.15407943725586
21820/28840	Well said Beauchamp here is my answer my dear	34.4128303527832
21821/28840	Sir said Albert rising I will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the	54.20867919921875
21822/28840	And this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will	70.07249450683594
21823/28840	No no I will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is I who have received the provocationin my opinion the time ought not to be	44.2007942199707
21824/28840	I know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while I am only moderately so I know too that you are a good marksmanthere we are about	60.40686798095703
21825/28840	I know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and I am brave	63.04669189453125

21831/28840	When he had concluded his speech Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert turned his back upon him and went to the press	54.31015396118164
21832/28840	He was passing the Chinese Baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte SaintMartin and to be going towards the Madele	31.10077476501465
21833/28840	Ah said Morcerf there goes a happy man And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his	100.31774139404297
21834/28840	The Lemonade   Morrel was in fact very	46.46049880981445
21835/28840	Noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab	50.4755859375
21836/28840	He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg SaintHonor	16.450864791870117
21837/28840	Morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor Barrois followed him as he best	108.45844268798828
21838/28840	Morrel was only thirtyone Barrois was sixty years of age Morrel was deeply in love and Barrois was dying with heat and exert	63.39581298828125
21839/28840	These two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of	257.1913757324219
21840/28840	On arriving at the house Morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but Barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to	51.73190689086914
21841/28840	The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of	79.76539611816406
21842/28840	She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her	77.36688995361328
21843/28840	But the easychair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the	47.51726150512695
21844/28840	Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from	79.71015930175781
21845/28840	Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on	78.76261138916016
21846/28840	Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to	36.17415237426758
21847/28840	Am I to say what you told me asked	104.95283508300781
21848/28840	Noirtier made a sign that she was to do	11.52817440032959
21849/28840	Monsieur Morrel said Valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather	50.35377502441406
21850/28840	Noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that I may repeat them to	34.46556854248047
21851/28840	I will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter I will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his	71.89862823486328

21853/28840	Valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for Morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming	86.02217864990234

21861/28840	Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but Morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear	51.26829528808594
21862/28840	Have I not explained your wishes grandpapa said Valentine addressing Noirt	59.307857513427734
21863/28840	Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case I shall expect	83.72897338867188
21864/28840	Morrel to come and claim me at my own	89.30549621582031

21868/28840	Morrel the justice to say that he ran still	189.9271697998047
21869/28840	Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a	52.795711517333984
21870/28840	The decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by	53.47470474243164
21871/28840	Come Barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade I see you are coveting a good draught of	41.013519287109375

21874/28840	Barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had	115.19374084472656
21875/28840	Valentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the door	33.9522705078125
21876/28840	It was the signal of a	92.39888763427734

21886/28840	What is the matter Barrois said	32.75128936767578
21887/28840	The old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand	67.63287353515625
21888/28840	He is going to fall cried Mor	56.119319915771484
21889/28840	The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous	75.41949462890625
21890/28840	Noirtier seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of	84.2581787109375
21891/28840	Barrois made some steps towards his	140.63092041015625

21902/28840	One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless	69.94599914550781

21909/28840	Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying	65.06590270996094
21910/28840	She turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the	82.53121185302734

21960/28840	Panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just	102.07916259765625
21961/28840	Madame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her	46.53187942504883

21976/28840	The doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to Noirtier said abruptly   How do you find yourselfwell  	38.23219299316406

22095/28840	The doctor without shaking hands with Villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole	56.066707611083984

22120/28840	Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him	57.75894546508789

22320/28840	Caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his	26.76836395263672
22321/28840	But Andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a Havana quietly lit it and began	108.56600952148438
22322/28840	When do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to Cader	27.3670654296875
22323/28840	Andrea took fiveandtwenty louis from his	54.90074920654297
22324/28840	Yellow boys said Caderousse no I thank	68.16075897216797
22325/28840	On the contrary I esteem them but will not have	105.94822692871094
22326/28840	You can change them idiot gold is worth five s	217.38232421875
22327/28840	Exactly and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in	134.43446350097656

22336/28840	Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the	75.16207885742188
22337/28840	How sprightly you are said Caderousse One would say you were already in possession of your	52.17096710205078
22338/28840	No unfortunately but when I do obtain it   Well   I shall remember old friends I can tell you	45.8992805480957
22339/28840	Yes since you have such a good	29.41326141357422
22340/28840	What do you want It looks as if you were trying to fleece me   I What an idea I who am going to give you another piece of good	45.85597610473633
22341/28840	What is it   To leave behind you the diamond you have on your	68.48739624023438
22342/28840	You will ruin both yourself and me by your	136.6663360595703
22343/28840	How You put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand franc	67.8050537109375
22344/28840	I know something of diamonds I have had	71.87579345703125
22345/28840	You do well to boast of it said Andrea who without becoming angry as Caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the	100.1808853149414
22346/28840	Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were	72.10352325439453
22347/28840	It is a false diamond said Cader	39.90164566040039
22348/28840	Do not be angry we can try	281.9083557128906
22349/28840	Caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would	73.77381896972656
22350/28840	_Confiteor_ said Caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger I was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers shopit is another branch of industry	70.2013168334961
22351/28840	Have you finished said Andreado you want anything morewill you have my waistcoat or my hat Make free now you have	168.013916015625

22353/28840	But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the	94.1522216796875
22354/28840	I shall not sell itdo not	116.39471435546875
22355/28840	Not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young	44.08740234375
22356/28840	Happy rogue said Caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed   Yes said	29.645803451538086
22357/28840	Well I hope you will make a handsome weddingpresent the day you marry Mademoiselle Dangl	16.24535369873047
22358/28840	I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your	29.523983001708984
22359/28840	What fortune has she   But I tell you   A million   Andrea shrugged his	27.60748291015625
22360/28840	Let it be a million said Caderousse you can never have so much as I wish	31.053747177124023
22361/28840	Oh I wish it you with all my heart added Caderousse with his hoarse	34.14111328125
22362/28840	Stop let me show you the	74.26725769042969
22363/28840	Why   Because there is a little secret a precaution I thought it desirable to take one of Huret  Fichets locks revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a	78.95167541503906
22364/28840	Thank you said Andrea I will let you know a week	124.5472412109375
22365/28840	Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories but also cross the	95.05758666992188
22366/28840	Then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan Andrea had left	98.40740966796875
22367/28840	Dear Benedetto said he I think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst	49.29967498779297
22368/28840	He was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to Andrea either by the arrival of Bertuccio from Normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sl	62.67229080200195
22369/28840	The house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to	74.25072479248047
22370/28840	The count praised Bertuccios zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a	81.5507583618164
22371/28840	Now said he I may require to go in one night from Paris to Tréport let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten	71.77725982666016
22372/28840	Your highness had already expressed that wish said Bertuccio and the horses are	83.98048400878906
22373/28840	I have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally	81.59427642822266
22374/28840	Thats well said Monte Cristo I remain here a day or twoarrange	71.04048156738281
22375/28840	As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders Baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver	47.68815994262695
22376/28840	What are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust I did not send for you I think   Baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the	41.34086227416992
22377/28840	The count opened the letter and read  	51.28245162963867
22378/28840	de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the ChampsÉlysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing	32.62528610229492
22379/28840	The counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this	182.9007110595703
22380/28840	The count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressingroom would be able to defend his property	68.64112854003906
22381/28840	Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and	322.7851867675781
22382/28840	de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be	85.61737060546875
22383/28840	The counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a	83.23604583740234
22384/28840	We know the counts vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great	158.76214599609375
22385/28840	From his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against God and sometimes against the world that is against the	89.18705749511719
22386/28840	They do not want my papers said Monte Cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but	93.79883575439453
22387/28840	I will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private	37.91167449951172
22388/28840	I am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this	79.12296295166016
22389/28840	The count recalled Baptistin who had left the room after delivering the	57.21100616455078
22390/28840	Return to Paris said he assemble the servants who remain	140.7344970703125
22391/28840	I want all my household at Auteu	29.364269256591797
22392/28840	But will no one remain in the house my lord asked Baptist	63.02306365966797
22393/28840	My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the	82.03894805908203
22394/28840	Well   The house might be stripped without his hearing the least	103.86309814453125
22395/28840	Thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disob	282.6009521484375
22396/28840	40150m       You understand me said the	8.746575355529785
22397/28840	Bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground	171.55323791503906
22398/28840	And those of the first floor   You know they are never	55.20734405517578
22399/28840	Go   The count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but Ali should attend	73.31446075439453
22400/28840	All was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as Baptistin had	81.68506622314453
22401/28840	Monte Cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passersby and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was	73.82939147949219
22402/28840	Ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching	51.06818771362305
22403/28840	Arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to Ali to stop then he passed into the dressingroom which he	64.16026306152344
22404/28840	Everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secret	66.60763549804688
22405/28840	He double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went	110.51530456542969
22406/28840	Meanwhile Ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a singlebarrelled	59.16865158081055
22407/28840	Thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his	133.46717834472656
22408/28840	The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining	51.35948944091797
22409/28840	He had within his reach his pistols and carbine and Ali standing near him held one of the small Arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the Crus	126.41118621826172
22410/28840	Through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressingroom the count could see into the	53.382808685302734
22411/28840	It was intensely dark still Ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the	102.28507232666016
22412/28840	The little light in the lodge had long been	285.9866943359375
22413/28840	It might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in Monte Cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his	122.97695922851562
22414/28840	It would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing	70.53141784667969
22415/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three	124.69841766357422
22416/28840	A firm and wellpractised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a	99.23003387451172
22417/28840	The count felt his heart beat more	195.99778747558594
22418/28840	Inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the	92.62615966796875
22419/28840	However Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his	53.99409103393555
22420/28840	Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his	107.57803344726562
22421/28840	The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing	80.91342163085938
22422/28840	He fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without	75.82581329345703
22423/28840	Through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man	110.13673400878906
22424/28840	Thats a daring rascal whispered the	166.50669860839844
22425/28840	At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the	211.9039306640625
22426/28840	He turned Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the	41.846946716308594
22427/28840	I see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands	95.89801788330078
22428/28840	He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing	27.222654342651367
22429/28840	The glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before	107.00110626220703
22430/28840	At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his	77.64629364013672
22431/28840	There were two doors he bolted them	339.4880676269531
22432/28840	When he drew near to the bedroom door Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper	48.58818435668945
22433/28840	The nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full	125.20014953613281
22434/28840	Alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was	83.77758026123047
22435/28840	But the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all	58.61183547973633
22436/28840	The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the	137.11058044433594
22437/28840	Ah ha whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a	48.83279800415039
22438/28840	But the man in the dark could not find the right	88.7379150390625
22439/28840	He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and count	153.0064239501953

22443/28840	It was an order the count had just given for immediately Ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a threecornered	81.04157257080078
22444/28840	who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hat	79.24140930175781
22445/28840	The tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb	82.4423599243164
22446/28840	The man hearing nothing more stood erect and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nighting	133.64938354492188

22448/28840	Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to Ali he whispered   Remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if I call	115.58175659179688
22449/28840	Ali bowed in token of strict	234.84141540527344

22451/28840	The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly	156.9269561767578
22452/28840	The count placed himself between Caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of	153.46595764160156
22453/28840	The Abbé Busoni repeated Caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the	14.106786727905273
22454/28840	Yes undoubtedly the Abbé Busoni himself replied Monte Crist	15.544841766357422

22526/28840	Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him Caderousse began to go	41.85562515258789
22527/28840	Then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the ChampsÉlysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a	24.843490600585938

22530/28840	Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first Caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came	42.11344909667969
22531/28840	The count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come	59.79099655151367
22532/28840	Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was	89.67884826660156
22533/28840	No one could be seen or	162.3050537109375
22534/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck	81.47045135498047
22535/28840	Then Caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the	61.42919158935547
22536/28840	But once started he could not	137.09718322753906

22538/28840	This time Caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three	33.36090087890625
22539/28840	The assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was	91.46504211425781

22767/28840	What I mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never	59.39787673950195

22776/28840	Monte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep	106.74925231933594
22777/28840	But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio	37.89694595336914
22778/28840	Bertuccio said he I intend going this evening to Normandy instead of tomorrow or the next	87.0089111328125
22779/28840	You will have sufficient time before five oclock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first	56.35446548461914
22780/28840	Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six o	39.343528747558594
22781/28840	From Pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were	112.14266967773438
22782/28840	Before his departure the count went to Haydées apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her	113.01380157470703
22783/28840	The journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which Morcerf had formed no previous	120.02970886230469
22784/28840	The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling	121.30400085449219

22788/28840	That is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses   You see I travel with	55.8819580078125
22789/28840	When I no longer require them Bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the	63.75234603881836
22790/28840	But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase	146.41232299804688
22791/28840	Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his	110.89215850830078
22792/28840	Count may I suggest one idea to you  	66.69092559814453
22793/28840	It is that next to you Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in	86.82858276367188
22794/28840	You are mistaken viscount I believe he has not a franc in his	102.41983032226562
22795/28840	My dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things I warn you I shall not believe	51.60402297973633
22796/28840	I countenance nothing that is marvellous	108.45782470703125
22797/28840	Tell me why does a steward rob his master   Because I suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of	65.96636962890625
22798/28840	You are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and	93.99549102783203
22799/28840	Also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the	103.28150177001953
22800/28840	Bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my	128.88900756835938
22801/28840	Why   Because I should never get a	40.259647369384766
22802/28840	But I deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and	80.73262786865234
22803/28840	Do you possess that right over Bertuccio  	56.234825134277344
22804/28840	There are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts	462.9466552734375
22805/28840	The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirtytwo horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight	151.10707092285156
22806/28840	At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful	59.531517028808594

22808/28840	At half past two in the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were	95.84005737304688
22809/28840	The servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him Baptistin who rode in front attended the	69.8343276977539
22810/28840	Albert bathed took his supper and went to	62.19328689575195
22811/28840	All night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the	66.21656799316406
22812/28840	On rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small	110.83194732666016
22813/28840	Around the schooner lay a number of small fishingboats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their	139.87686157226562

22815/28840	Albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the Englisheminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for	99.39331817626953
22816/28840	The day passed in pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo exce	78.4432373046875

22818/28840	Towards the evening of the third	112.45850372314453
22819/28840	He was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience Monte Crist	30.62501335144043
22820/28840	40188m       Florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill And he hastened to the	34.54767608642578
22821/28840	Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a	48.97111511230469
22822/28840	From whom is this said he	256.2803039550781
22823/28840	Did he send you   Yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till I had reached you I have come in fifteen	68.85387420654297
22824/28840	Albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the	101.42928314208984
22825/28840	His sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported	116.20466613769531
22826/28840	Poor young man said Monte Cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth	40.96915817260742
22827/28840	Meanwhile Albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying   Florentin is your horse fit to return immediately   It is a poor lame post	58.52336502075195
22828/28840	In what state was the house when you left   All was quiet but on returning from	106.8122329711914
22829/28840	Beauchamps I found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would	69.83329772949219
22830/28840	I told her my orders from	184.4731903076172

22832/28840	Yes my mother said Albert I will return and woe to the infamous wretch But first of all I must get	76.84622955322266
22833/28840	He went back to the room where he had left Monte Crist	22.46053695678711
22834/28840	Five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his	47.128902435302734
22835/28840	His voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blueveined lids and he tottered like a drunken	89.11759948730469
22836/28840	Count said he I thank you for your hospitality which I would gladly have enjoyed longer but I must return to	55.499454498291016

22840/28840	No it would delay me and I need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me	88.82571411132812
22841/28840	Albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the	30.422836303710938

22847/28840	You may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate	76.4019775390625
22848/28840	Read that said he when I am gone that you may not be witness of my	64.69993591308594
22849/28840	While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an	34.81163024902344

22851/28840	The Trial   At eight oclock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamps	25.89374542236328
22852/28840	The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at	38.20622253417969
22853/28840	Well my poor friend replied Beauchamp I expected	33.376949310302734
22854/28840	I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful	57.86891174316406
22855/28840	Your having sent for me is another proof of your	73.98995971679688
22856/28840	So without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds   I think I have some cle	63.63389205932617
22857/28840	But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful	79.50395965576172
22858/28840	Beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following	63.24327850341797
22859/28840	Two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides _ lImpartial_ and what was more serious one that was well known as a government	127.89707946777344
22860/28840	Beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the	163.74322509765625
22861/28840	He sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers	38.025047302246094

22864/28840	Ah _pardieu_ said Beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend I need not tell you the cause of my	22.957109451293945
22865/28840	Are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial	152.90249633789062
22866/28840	No replied Beauchamp I have not considered the question a totally different subject interests	80.59877014160156
22867/28840	What is it   The article relative to Morcer	19.795503616333008
22868/28840	Indeed Is it not a curious affair   So curious that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of	53.483070373535156
22869/28840	Not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure	96.0087890625
22870/28840	de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on	91.79676818847656
22871/28840	Who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing	110.43354797363281
22872/28840	de Morcerf as he is a peer of France and we are of the	36.44083786010742
22873/28840	Oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandal	84.23511505126953
22874/28840	A man arrived yesterday from Yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other	107.69300842285156
22875/28840	Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcer	93.90436553955078
22876/28840	But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of that dignified	71.34845733642578

22881/28840	The true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised	218.0281219482422

22896/28840	Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the	41.959877014160156
22897/28840	This timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their	83.88202667236328
22898/28840	The president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take	77.020263671875
22899/28840	The count was asked what time he required to prepare his	259.4512634277344
22900/28840	Morcerfs courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible	143.89292907714844
22901/28840	My lords answered he it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that I must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled	132.26577758789062
22902/28840	Oh that I could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that I am their equal in	129.13255310058594
22903/28840	These words made a favorable impression on behalf of the	87.88284301757812
22904/28840	I demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and I will furnish the house with all necessary	74.08396911621094
22905/28840	What day do you fix asked the	116.25631713867188
22906/28840	Today I am at your service replied the	20.924894332885742
22907/28840	Does the House approve that the examination should take place today   40196m       Yes was the unanimous	37.355201721191406
22908/28840	A committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by Morcer	196.54144287109375
22909/28840	The investigation would begin at eight oclock that evening in the committeeroom and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same	68.23165130615234
22910/28840	Morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had fore	96.15819549560547
22911/28840	Beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead	127.34627532958984
22912/28840	Albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from Beauchamps confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his	138.7598876953125
22913/28840	What next My friend you impose a painful task on	217.0959930419922
22914/28840	Must you know all   Absolutely and rather from your lips than another	246.61648559570312
22915/28840	Muster up all your courage then for never have you required it	375.8980407714844
22916/28840	Albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his	58.35210418701172
22917/28840	He thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for	441.4604187011719
22918/28840	The evening arrived all Paris was in	539.500244140625
22919/28840	Many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many others said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for Brussels and others went to the policeoffice to inquire if he had taken out a	72.05341339111328
22920/28840	I used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the	67.98839569091797
22921/28840	He called for me at seven oclock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the doorkeepers to place me in a	72.25489044189453
22922/28840	I was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take	38.15592956542969
22923/28840	At eight oclock all were in their places and	60.08205795288086
22924/28840	de Morcerf entered at the last	33.32353210449219
22925/28840	He held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the	75.4028091430664
22926/28840	The committee was made up of Liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with	161.51039123535156
22927/28840	Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully	110.3840560913086
22928/28840	At this moment one of the doorkeepers brought in a letter for the	55.17155456542969
22929/28840	You are at liberty to speak	68.89190673828125
22930/28840	de Morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence I assure you Albert in a most eloquent and skilful	34.951026916503906
22931/28840	He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the	70.07012176513672
22932/28840	He produced the ring his mark of authority with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the ha	91.32920837402344
22933/28840	Unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was	65.82889556884766
22934/28840	But said the count so great was Ali Pashas confidence that on his deathbed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my	93.38277435302734
22935/28840	Albert started on hearing these words the history of Haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a	40.12504196166992
22936/28840	And what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired	246.93820190429688
22937/28840	I acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said Beauch	103.35826110839844
22938/28840	Meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on	61.82035827636719
22939/28840	de Morcerf Count said he you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter to your careYes sir replied Morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued	44.79789733886719
22940/28840	On my return Vasiliki and her daughter Haydée had	37.632816314697266
22941/28840	Did you know themMy intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and I had seen them above twenty	63.34686279296875
22942/28840	Have you any idea what became of themYes sir I heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their	191.11282348632812
22943/28840	I was not rich my life was in constant danger I could not seek them to my great	63.95552062988281
22944/28840	Gentlemen said he you have heard the Comte de Morcerfs	55.43959426879883
22945/28840	Can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedAlas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away I know not	60.54421615600586
22946/28840	I believe that I alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful	96.10928344726562
22947/28840	A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment Albert had nothing more transpired your fathers cause had been	69.70135498046875
22948/28840	It only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed Gentlemen and you monsieuryou will not be displeased I presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented	54.60491943359375
22949/28840	He is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our	88.62049102783203
22950/28840	Here is a letter I have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over and shall we take no notice of this incident	82.69820404052734
22951/28840	de Morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he	34.93513488769531
22952/28840	The committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and	142.0220947265625

22954/28840	The president paused and the count turned	131.6808319091797
22955/28840	The president resumed   I was on the spot at the death of Ali P	37.05142593383789
22956/28840	I was present during his last	153.5097198486328
22957/28840	I know what is become of Vasiliki and Hayd	19.894441604614258
22958/28840	I am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being	38.27735137939453
22959/28840	I shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to	47.34637451171875
22960/28840	And who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible	57.868690490722656
22961/28840	We shall know sir replied the	92.31649017333984
22962/28840	Is the committee willing to hear this witnessYes yes they all said at	268.88262939453125
22963/28840	Is there anyone in the lobby said the	119.1356201171875
22964/28840	Who is itA woman accompanied by a	304.8516540527344
22965/28840	Five minutes after the doorkeeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and I said Beauchamp shared the general expectation and	76.0703353881836
22966/28840	Behind the doorkeeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed	103.07496643066406
22967/28840	It was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was	76.3497543334961
22968/28840	The president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian costume and was remarkably	63.22331619262695
22969/28840	Who told you that   Alas I guess	41.07492446899414
22970/28840	You see I am calm and	96.82013702392578
22971/28840	And yet we must be drawing near the	174.46615600585938
22972/28840	de Morcerf continued Beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and	33.1824951171875
22973/28840	Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or	228.4239501953125
22974/28840	To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary	122.27236938476562
22975/28840	The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of	137.19168090820312
22976/28840	As for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support	32.09022903442383
22977/28840	Madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the	44.11447525024414
22978/28840	I was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the	38.6665153503418
22979/28840	But allow me to say that you must have been very young	41.720237731933594
22980/28840	I was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my	83.85176086425781
22981/28840	In what manner could these events concern you and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on youOn them depended my fathers life replied	106.102783203125
22982/28840	I am Haydée the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and of Vasiliki his beloved	15.523516654968262
22983/28840	40202m       The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the	41.635746002197266
22984/28840	As for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before	51.51657485961914
22985/28840	A greenish pallor spread over the counts cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous	80.80303192138672
22986/28840	Haydée still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in	100.81940460205078
22987/28840	It had been supposed some of the papers might be in the Arabian Romaic or Turkish language and the interpreter of the House was in	66.80713653564453
22988/28840	The abovementioned purchase was made on his highnesss account whose mandate I had for the sum of four hundred thousand franc	66.0887222290039
22989/28840	Given at Constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the Heg	93.24230194091797
22990/28840	That this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to	83.58146667480469
22991/28840	Near the merchants signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime	230.43450927734375
22992/28840	A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on Haydée seemed one of fire and	100.63592529296875
22993/28840	Madame said the president may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo who is now I believe in Paris   Sir replied Haydée the Count of Monte Cristo my fosterfather has been in Normandy the last three	18.970590591430664
22994/28840	Although a Christian may God forgive me I have always sought to revenge my illustrious	78.96172332763672
22995/28840	Since I set my foot in France and knew the traitor lived in Paris I have watched	160.36610412597656
22996/28840	I live retired in the house of my noble protector but I do it from	103.5
22997/28840	I love retirement and silence because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past	90.6971435546875
22998/28840	But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the	29.236995697021484
22999/28840	40204m       Then remarked the president the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingsHe is quite unaware of them and I have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what I have	23.72844123840332
23000/28840	But it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which I find at last an opportunity of avenging my father   The count had not uttered one word the whole of this	39.2927131652832
23001/28840	His colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a	61.80653762817383
23002/28840	His misery was depicted in sinister lines on his count	172.34019470214844
23003/28840	de Morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of YaninaNo said Morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my	33.20431137084961
23004/28840	Haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked You do not know me said	73.0234375
23005/28840	de Morcerf as the officer Fernand MondegoIndeed I do cried Hayd	29.66045379638672
23006/28840	Oh my mother it was you who said You were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a	111.22466278076172
23007/28840	This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused	262.5827331542969
23008/28840	Count of Morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down	37.40653610229492
23009/28840	The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of God it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending	74.55941772460938
23010/28840	Shall further inquiries be made Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina Speak Morcerf did not	144.9099884033203
23011/28840	Then all the members looked at each other with	54.44086837768555
23012/28840	They knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend	91.01583862304688
23013/28840	They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery	76.720458984375
23014/28840	Well asked the president what is your decision   40206m       I have no reply to make said the count in a low	10.827042579650879
23015/28840	Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth said the	48.76294708251953
23016/28840	Is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead Not guilty Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his	112.25555419921875
23017/28840	Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named	149.1548309326172
23018/28840	Gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this HouseYes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous	97.07466888427734
23019/28840	Haydée had remained until the close of the	132.22679138183594
23020/28840	She heard the counts sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes to his goddess	60.56870651245117
23021/28840	The Challenge   Then continued Beauchamp I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being	40.221282958984375
23022/28840	The usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de Vaugir	57.39662170410156
23023/28840	I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and	269.8354187011719

23026/28840	Albert held his head between his hands he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing Beauchamps arm   My friend said he my life is	48.07611846923828
23027/28840	I cannot calmly say with you Providence has struck the blow but I must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when I have found him I shall kill him or he will kill	66.10274505615234
23028/28840	I rely on your friendship to assist me Beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your	84.00948333740234

23033/28840	Thank you my dear Beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it cannot	48.53179931640625
23034/28840	I have told you my wish or rather my	53.44070816040039
23035/28840	You understand that interested as I am in this affair I cannot see it in the same light as you	52.368927001953125
23036/28840	What appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less	106.6115493774414
23037/28840	Now I repeat Beauchamp I wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the	87.64196014404297
23038/28840	Be it so said Beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth I submit and if you will seek your enemy I will assist you and I will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as	56.46741485595703
23039/28840	Well then you understand Beauchamp that we begin our search	114.77074432373047

23042/28840	Ah Beauchamp I see you know something already you will restore me to	47.515968322753906
23043/28840	I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more	45.66543960571289
23044/28840	Well I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from Yan	30.830223083496094
23045/28840	I went of course to the chief banker of the town to make	150.53819274902344
23046/28840	At the first word before I had even mentioned your fathers name   Ah said	65.74231719970703
23047/28840	How and why   Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same	101.48080444335938
23048/28840	By whom   By a banker of Paris my	109.44364929199219
23049/28840	He cried Albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous	129.27264404296875
23050/28840	He the man who would be popular cannot forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assignedyes it is all from the same	88.77130126953125
23051/28840	Make inquiries Albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true   Oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all I have	51.193824768066406
23052/28840	Beware Morcerf he is already an old	74.8170166015625
23053/28840	I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally Oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to	83.677734375
23054/28840	I do not condemn you Albert I only restrain	61.041770935058594
23055/28840	Oh do not fear besides you will accompany	27.052200317382812
23056/28840	Beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a	182.79092407226562
23057/28840	Danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or I shall	43.04231643676758
23058/28840	_Pardieu_ Beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral   When such resolutions are made Albert they should be promptly	103.13420867919922
23059/28840	Do you wish to go to	37.129493713378906
23060/28840	On entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of	98.70780944824219
23061/28840	Ah _parbleu_ thats good said Albert with a gloomy	32.92543029785156
23062/28840	Danglars will not fight with me I will kill his soninlaw Cavalcanti will certainly	21.58040428161621
23063/28840	The servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him	79.12726593017578
23064/28840	It was however too late Albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the bankers	58.67701721191406
23065/28840	Sir cried the latter am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house You appear to forget yourself	97.13528442382812
23066/28840	No sir said Albert coldly there are circumstances in which one cannot except through cowardiceI offer you that refugerefuse to admit certain persons at	151.4212646484375
23067/28840	Danglars turned pale Cavalcanti moved a step forward and Albert turned towards	27.94967269897461
23068/28840	And you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept	53.590084075927734
23069/28840	Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young	43.70344543457031
23070/28840	Alberts attack on Andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first	131.4370574951172
23071/28840	Indeed sir said he to Albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you I shall resign the case to the kings	39.65144729614258
23072/28840	You mistake sir said Morcerf with a gloomy smile I am not referring in the least to matrimony and I only addressed myself to	30.202577590942383
23073/28840	Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between	475.3450927734375
23074/28840	In one respect you are right for I am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim	72.60000610351562
23075/28840	Now if you are mad and try to bite me I will kill you without	64.2395248413086
23076/28840	Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself   Yes miserable wretch cried Morcerf it is your	38.55958557128906
23077/28840	My fault said he you must be mad What do I know of the Grecian affair Have I travelled in that country Did I advise your father to sell the castle of Yaninato betray   Silence said Albert with a thundering	71.1725082397461
23078/28840	No it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked	111.50967407226562
23079/28840	I   Yes you How came it known   I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina   Who wrote to Yanina   To Yanina  	31.55537223815918
23080/28840	Who wrote for particulars concerning my father   I imagine anyone may write to Yan	119.44681549072266
23081/28840	But one person only wrote   One only   Yes and that was you   I doubtless	88.13241577148438
23082/28840	It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a	68.27906799316406
23083/28840	You wrote sir knowing what answer you would	241.70042419433594
23084/28840	Who then urged you to write Tell	271.7303771972656
23085/28840	_Pardieu_ it was the most simple thing in the	30.710660934448242
23086/28840	I was speaking of your fathers past	172.53834533691406
23087/28840	I said the origin of his fortune remained	151.0381317138672
23088/28840	The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property I answered In	133.616943359375
23089/28840	And who thus advised you   No other than your friend Monte Crist	69.86394500732422
23090/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina   Yes and I wrote and will show you my correspondence if you	26.535125732421875
23091/28840	Albert and Beauchamp looked at each	15.415477752685547
23092/28840	Sir said Beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from Paris at this moment and cannot justify	35.75310134887695
23093/28840	I accuse no one sir said Danglars I relate and I will repeat before the count what I have said to	36.970455169677734
23094/28840	Does the count know what answer you received   Yes I showed it to	104.23047637939453
23095/28840	Did he know my fathers Christian name was Fernand and his family name Mondego   Yes I had told him that long since and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps	58.737457275390625
23096/28840	When the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughters hand for you I decidedly refused him but without any explanation or	79.95809173583984
23097/28840	In short why should I have any more to do with the affair How did the honor or disgrace of	76.07697296142578
23098/28840	de Morcerf affect me It neither increased nor decreased my	224.57867431640625
23099/28840	Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the	50.439456939697266
23100/28840	Danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through	55.67630386352539
23101/28840	In addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his	242.55929565429688
23102/28840	Monte Cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha and knowing everything he had advised Danglars to write to Yan	39.65219497680664
23103/28840	Besides had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his fathers name before Haydée Lastly he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was	68.10088348388672
23104/28840	There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged Monte Cristo then was in league with his fathers	81.06959533691406
23105/28840	Albert took Beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to	164.83738708496094
23106/28840	You are right said the latter	60.26531982421875
23107/28840	Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of	38.27016830444336
23108/28840	de Monte Cristo that you must demand an	39.750831604003906
23109/28840	Sir said he to Danglars understand that I do not take a final leave of you I must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Crist	36.29472351074219
23110/28840	He bowed to the banker and went out with Beauchamp without appearing to notice Cavalc	45.132057189941406
23111/28840	Danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcer	28.34209632873535
23112/28840	The Insult   At the bankers door Beauchamp stopped Morcer	54.8134880065918
23113/28840	Listen said he just now I told you it was of	62.844390869140625
23114/28840	de Monte Cristo you must demand an	43.601356506347656
23115/28840	Yes and we are going to his	30.933706283569336
23116/28840	Reflect Morcerf one moment before you	223.9746551513672
23117/28840	On what shall I reflect   On the importance of the step you are	70.11634063720703
23118/28840	Is it more serious than going to	160.5934600830078
23119/28840	Danglars is a moneylover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a	95.74518585205078
23120/28840	The other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully   I only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not	49.0162239074707
23121/28840	Do not be alarmed said Beauchamp he will meet	58.29389572143555
23122/28840	My only fear is that he will be too strong for	100.0775146484375
23123/28840	My friend said Morcerf with a sweet smile that is what I	26.071134567260742
23124/28840	The happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us	53.11565399169922
23125/28840	My poor mother said Albert passing his hand across his eyes I know she would but better so than die of	114.21617889404297
23126/28840	Are you quite decided Albert   Yes let us	36.240966796875
23127/28840	But do you think we shall find the count at home   He intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at	69.77623748779297
23128/28840	They ordered the driver to take them to	139.2610626220703
23129/28840	Beauchamp wished to go in alone but Albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of du	89.04267120361328
23130/28840	The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following Morcer	54.58026885986328
23131/28840	Albert sprang from the porters lodge to the	37.66270065307617
23132/28840	The count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be	70.07957458496094
23133/28840	And after dinner   He will sleep an	99.40113830566406
23134/28840	Then   He is going to the	29.0241641998291
23135/28840	Are you sure of it asked	50.760780334472656
23136/28840	Quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock	95.07019805908203
23137/28840	Very good replied Albert that is all I wished to	55.236839294433594
23138/28840	Then turning towards Beauchamp If you have anything to attend to Beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till	44.093868255615234
23139/28840	I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera and if you can bring ChâteauRenaud with	22.480220794677734
23140/28840	Beauchamp availed himself of Alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before	70.3254165649414
23141/28840	On his return home Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray and Morrel to see them at the Opera that	60.87135696411133
23142/28840	Then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her	63.201438903808594
23143/28840	He found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public	163.87757873535156
23144/28840	The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercédès she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved	84.5435562133789
23145/28840	Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers	152.20162963867188
23146/28840	It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing	112.02086639404297
23147/28840	My dear mother said he do you know if	71.03960418701172
23148/28840	de Morcerf has any enemy   Mercédès started she noticed that the young man did not say my	27.078554153442383
23149/28840	My son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret	408.6086120605469
23150/28840	Those who are known are not the most	212.49575805664062
23151/28840	I know it and appeal to your	96.10438537597656
23152/28840	You are of so superior a mind nothing escapes	143.5506134033203
23153/28840	Why do you say so   Because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that	68.44155883789062
23154/28840	de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our	85.05599212646484
23155/28840	Mercédès raised herself on her feverish	13.292807579040527
23156/28840	de Monte Cristo she exclaimed and how is he connected with the question you asked me   40219m       You know mother	22.408836364746094
23157/28840	de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their	86.20285034179688
23158/28840	de Monte Cristo is our enemy replied Mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered	32.4322624206543
23159/28840	Who told you so Why you are mad Albert	228.1963348388672
23160/28840	de Monte Cristo has only shown us	150.44627380371094
23161/28840	de Monte Cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to	98.52079010009766
23162/28840	Oh I entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his	65.88837432861328
23163/28840	Mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that	53.26077651977539
23164/28840	I said Mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than	21.47568130493164
23165/28840	Yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm   Mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze You speak strangely said she to Albert and you appear to have some singular	47.56694412231445
23166/28840	What has the count done Three days since you were with him in Normandy only three days since we looked on him as our best	101.67872619628906
23167/28840	An ironical smile passed over Alberts	42.082786560058594
23168/28840	Mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strongminded she concealed both her sorrows and her	52.12874221801758
23169/28840	Albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed   You came to inquire after my health I will candidly acknowledge that I am not	54.33607864379883
23170/28840	You should install yourself here and cheer my	256.17486572265625
23171/28840	I do not wish to be left	15.000594139099121
23172/28840	Mother said the young man you know how gladly I would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole	57.15229797363281
23173/28840	Well replied Mercédès sighing go Albert I will not make you a slave to your filial	38.293270111083984
23174/28840	Albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted	76.30669403076172
23175/28840	Scarcely had he shut her door when Mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he	61.961219787597656
23176/28840	Then she rang for her ladys maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might	78.22132873535156
23177/28840	The footmans mission was an easy	170.23654174804688
23178/28840	Albert went to his room and dressed with unusual	145.99522399902344
23179/28840	At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived he had seen ChâteauRenaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was	31.05589485168457
23180/28840	Both got into Alberts _coupé_ and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud To the	29.266523361206055
23181/28840	In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the	54.363460540771484
23182/28840	40221m       ChâteauRenaud was at his post apprised by Beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from	19.765396118164062
23183/28840	The conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that ChâteauRenaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of	44.47763442993164
23184/28840	Debray was not yet come but Albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the	87.98712921142578
23185/28840	Albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn	128.07679748535156
23186/28840	de Monte Cristo either in the lobby or on the	50.320289611816406
23187/28840	The bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with ChâteauRenaud and Beauch	20.779193878173828
23188/28840	But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first	54.19911193847656
23189/28840	At last as Albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and Monte Cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the	40.62178421020508
23190/28840	Morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother inlaw he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to	95.7598876953125
23191/28840	The count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his	146.13778686523438
23192/28840	He recognized Albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomp	87.63259887695312
23193/28840	Without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another	106.02949523925781
23194/28840	Although apparently not noticing Albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two	39.850582122802734
23195/28840	Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on	59.725372314453125
23196/28840	He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel but he was well prepared for what might	58.69851303100586
23197/28840	The door opened and Monte Cristo turning round saw Albert pale and trembling followed by Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	18.274856567382812
23198/28840	Well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his	71.28752136230469
23199/28840	The countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordial	100.48167419433594
23200/28840	Morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the Opera but he understood that something terrible was bro	39.97857666015625
23201/28840	We are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said Albert but to demand an	72.64128875732422
23202/28840	The young mans trembling voice was scarcely	153.19944763183594
23203/28840	An explanation at the Opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is	60.555938720703125
23204/28840	Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians I should not have thought this the place for such a	74.03739166259766
23205/28840	Still if people will shut themselves up said Albert and cannot be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be	126.30291748046875
23206/28840	I am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my	80.947265625
23207/28840	Yesterday I was at your house sir said the young man because then I knew not who you	56.26189041137695
23208/28840	In pronouncing these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the	45.855560302734375
23209/28840	Thus the attention of many was attracted by this	196.05050659179688
23210/28840	Where are you come from sir  said Monte Cristo You do not appear to be in the possession of your	33.490928649902344
23211/28840	Provided I understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged I shall be reasonable enough said Albert	93.95645141601562
23212/28840	I do not understand you sir replied Monte Cristo and if I did your tone is too	30.1901798248291
23213/28840	I am at home here and I alone have a right to raise my voice above another	90.48966979980469
23214/28840	Leave the box sir   Monte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding	38.49650573730469
23215/28840	Ah I shall know how to make you leave your home replied Albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which Monte Cristo did not lose sight	32.12434768676758
23216/28840	Well well said Monte Cristo quietly I see you wish to quarrel with me but I would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in	36.44173049926758
23217/28840	It is in poor taste to make a display of a	166.6858367919922
23218/28840	Display is not becoming to everyone	693.1341552734375
23219/28840	At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this	65.729248046875
23220/28840	They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole	69.46226501464844
23221/28840	Albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when Morrel seized his hand while Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him	38.41675567626953
23222/28840	Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the	87.99685668945312
23223/28840	Wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed Albert stepped back and Morrel closed the	58.44867706298828
23224/28840	Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like	85.47562408447266
23225/28840	Morrel whispered What have you done to him   I Nothingat least personally said Monte Crist	35.21707534790039
23226/28840	But there must be some cause for this strange	72.2603988647461
23227/28840	The Count of Morcerfs adventure exasperates the young	28.872201919555664
23228/28840	Have you anything to do with it   It was through Haydée that the Chamber was informed of his fathers	51.237144470214844
23229/28840	I had been told but would not credit it that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali P	51.518760681152344
23230/28840	Then said Morrel I understand it all and this scene was premed	50.007389068603516
23231/28840	Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer	81.7364501953125
23232/28840	Probably said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquill	9.742459297180176
23233/28840	But what shall you do with him   With whom   With	29.24032974243164
23234/28840	What shall I do with Albert As certainly Maximilian as I now press your hand I shall kill him before ten oclock tomorrow	54.47060012817383
23235/28840	Morrel in his turn took Monte Cristos hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it	55.51237106323242
23236/28840	Ah count said he his father loves him so much   Do not speak to me of that said Monte Cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed I will make him	40.96908187866211
23237/28840	Morrel amazed let fall Monte Cristos	94.41764831542969
23238/28840	Dear Maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably Duprez is singing that line   O Mathilde idole de mon âme     I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples and the first to applaud	46.55414581298828
23239/28840	Bravo bravo   Morrel saw it was useless to say more and ref	83.43496704101562
23240/28840	The curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with Albert again fell and a rap was heard at the	72.1231918334961
23241/28840	Come in said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately Beauchamp	64.36407470703125
23242/28840	Beauchamp said Monte Cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be	37.60531997680664
23243/28840	Beauchamp bowed and sitting down Sir said he I just now accompanied	143.91192626953125
23244/28840	And that means replied Monte Cristo laughing that you had probably just dined	101.78913116455078
23245/28840	Beauchamp that you are more sober than he	39.58955383300781
23246/28840	Beauchamp Albert was wrong I acknowledge to betray so much anger and I come on my own account to apologize for	94.3133544921875
23247/28840	And having done so entirely on my own account be it understood I would add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yan	93.304443359375
23248/28840	Then I will add two words about the young Greek	110.61959075927734
23249/28840	Monte Cristo motioned him to be	49.23795700073242
23250/28840	Come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be	93.63345336914062
23251/28840	Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric	183.47662353515625
23252/28840	I am in your opinion a Lara a Manfred a Lord Ruthven then just as I am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of	65.2271957397461
23253/28840	You bring me down to your own level and demand explanations Indeed	117.69482421875
23254/28840	Yet replied Beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands  	45.4259147644043
23255/28840	Beauchamp interposed this strange man the Count of Monte Cristo bows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo	29.26878547668457
23256/28840	Beauchamp and it is always well	69.63133239746094
23257/28840	Sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such	39.85206604003906
23258/28840	I am sir a living guaranty replied Monte Cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guarant	73.26763153076172
23259/28840	Tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock I shall see what color his	112.50714874267578
23260/28840	Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel said Beauch	44.02083969116211
23261/28840	It is quite immaterial to me said Monte Cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a tr	35.287994384765625
23262/28840	In France people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in Arabia with the	119.33126068115234
23263/28840	Sure to gain repeated Beauchamp looking with amazement at the	75.23773956298828
23264/28840	Certainly said Monte Cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise I would not fight with	26.20844841003418
23265/28840	I shall kill himI cannot help	63.55265808105469
23266/28840	Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour I do not like to be kept	70.58528137207031
23267/28840	Pistols then at eight oclock in the Bois de Vincennes said Beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural	52.389034271240234
23268/28840	Now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend Albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his illchosen barbarisms let him go home and go to	93.26747131347656
23269/28840	Now said Monte Cristo turning towards Morrel I may depend upon you may I not   Certainly said Morrel I am at your service count still   What   It is desirable I should know the real	29.694721221923828
23270/28840	That is to say you would rather not  	28.12763023376465

23272/28840	Enough said Morrel who is your second witness   I know no one in Paris Morrel on whom I could confer that honor besides you and your brother	62.63787078857422
23273/28840	Do you think Emmanuel would oblige me   I will answer for him	33.585086822509766

23275/28840	Listen I never lose a note of this opera if I can avoid it the music of _William Tell_ is so	141.39590454101562
23276/28840	The Night   Monte Cristo waited according to his usual custom until Duprez had sung his famous _Suivezmoi_ then he rose and went	38.95315170288086
23277/28840	Morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oclock and to bring	46.622718811035156
23278/28840	Then he stepped into his _coupé_ calm and smiling and was at home in five	41.076393127441406
23279/28840	No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said   Ali bring me my pistols with the ivory	146.9065399169922
23280/28840	Ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and	75.70464324951172
23281/28840	These were pistols of an especial pattern which Monte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own	46.29038619995117
23282/28840	A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand	84.09356689453125
23283/28840	He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and Baptistin	83.64637756347656
23284/28840	Before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after Baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed	59.86280059814453
23285/28840	Baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after	34.8217658996582
23286/28840	Who are you madame said the count to the veiled	52.58346176147461
23287/28840	What name did you pronounce then Madame de Morcerf said	41.40557098388672
23288/28840	Yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which I alone perhaps have not	355.0813293457031
23289/28840	Edmond it is not Madame de Morcerf who is come to you it is Mercédè	16.33684730529785
23290/28840	Mercédès is dead madame said Monte Cristo I know no one now of that	15.091574668884277
23291/28840	Fernand do you mean replied Monte Cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them	61.85978698730469
23292/28840	Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every	40.365291595458984
23293/28840	You see Edmond I am not mistaken and have cause to say Spare my son   And who told you madame that I have any hostile intentions against your son   No one in truth but a mother has twofold	56.87844467163086
23294/28840	I guessed all I followed him this evening to the Opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen	117.21936798095703
23295/28840	If you have seen all madame you know that the son of Fernand has publicly insulted me said Monte Cristo with awful calm	37.70802307128906
23296/28840	Oh for pitys sake   You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel one of my friends had not stopped	53.02391052246094
23297/28840	Listen to me my son has also guessed who you arehe attributes his fathers misfortunes to	74.74356079101562
23298/28840	Madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunesit is a	35.15762710571289
23299/28840	It is not I who strike	233.85171508789062
23300/28840	de Morcerf it is Providence which punishes	63.37846374511719
23301/28840	And why do you represent Providence cried Mercédè	27.32330322265625
23302/28840	It does not concern me you are right and if I have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the French captain or the Count of Morcerf but on the fisherman Fernand the husband of Mercédès the Catal	25.66493797302246
23303/28840	Ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commitfor I am the only culprit Edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my	69.38665771484375
23304/28840	But exclaimed Monte Cristo why was I absent And why were you alone   40231m       Because you had been arrested Edmond and were a	23.27435874938965
23305/28840	And why was I arrested Why was I a prisoner   I do not know said Mercédè	34.81963348388672
23306/28840	You do not madame at least I hope	26.89079475402832
23307/28840	I was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of La Réserve the day before I was to marry you a man named Danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman Fernand himself	46.693824768066406
23308/28840	Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned Edmond Dantès who either carries the letter for Paris about with him or has it at his fathers ab	49.63636016845703
23309/28840	Should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the _Pharaon	39.18319320678711
23310/28840	And the result of that letter   You well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest	51.61625671386719
23311/28840	You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the Château d	19.234771728515625
23312/28840	That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it and that is why on account of the living Mercédès and my deceased father I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand andI have revenged	56.14651107788086
23313/28840	Compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married	121.49485778808594

23318/28840	Her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised	141.25547790527344
23319/28840	Then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of Monte Cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening	75.64369201660156
23320/28840	Mercédès I must revenge myself for I suffered fourteen yearsfourteen years I wept I cursed now I tell you Mercédès I must revenge	32.583534240722656
23321/28840	The count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his	59.604915618896484
23322/28840	Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet why should I seek to make myself better than God   Edmond continued Mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since I first knew you I have adored your name have respected your	55.8911247253418
23323/28840	Edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my	74.89950561523438
23324/28840	Mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that Monte Cristo could not restrain a	18.5157470703125
23325/28840	The lion was daunted the avenger was	238.7657470703125
23326/28840	Oh said she seizing the counts hand and raising it to her lips oh thank you thank you Edmond Now you are exactly what I dreamt you werethe man I always	84.49317932128906
23327/28840	Oh now I may say so   So much the better replied Monte Cristo as that poor Edmond will not have long to be loved by	26.739391326904297
23328/28840	Death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in	100.3629150390625
23329/28840	What do you say Edmond   I say since you command me Mercédès I must	18.91657829284668
23330/28840	What I most loved after you Mercédès was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men that strength was my	116.80787658691406
23331/28840	With one word you have crushed it and I	142.98196411132812
23332/28840	But the duel will not take place Edmond since you forgive   It will take place said Monte Cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your sons blood to stain the ground mine will	72.73688507080078
23333/28840	Mercédès shrieked and sprang towards Monte Cristo but suddenly stopping Edmond said she there is a God above us since you live and since I have seen you again I trust to him from my	31.20791244506836
23334/28840	While waiting his assistance I trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not   Yes madame he shall live said Monte Cristo surprised that without more emotion Mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for	50.66680908203125
23335/28840	Mercédès extended her hand to the	7.039166450500488
23336/28840	Ah believe me Edmond as I told you I too have suffered much I repeat it is melancholy to pass ones life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet	105.1208724975586

23341/28840	Edmond said Mercédès I have but one word more to say to	17.234859466552734
23342/28840	Edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if Mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the	80.98575592041016
23343/28840	Adieu then Edmond I have nothing more to ask of heavenI have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you	76.78748321533203
23344/28840	Mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged	37.21622085571289
23345/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the ChampsÉlysées and made Monte Cristo raise his	26.539989471435547
23346/28840	The Meeting   After Mercédès had left Monte Cristo he fell into profound	45.153743743896484
23347/28840	Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme	151.51516723632812
23348/28840	No it is not existence then that I regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously	153.9893341064453
23349/28840	Providence is now opposed to them when I most thought it would be prop	210.3009033203125
23350/28840	It is not Gods will that they should be	107.51705932617188
23351/28840	This burden almost as heavy as a world which I had raised and I had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my	74.06966400146484
23352/28840	There are virtues which become crimes by	501.60382080078125
23353/28840	No she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear	132.35699462890625
23354/28840	The blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his	130.90884399414062
23355/28840	Ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on	282.7809143066406
23356/28840	I ridiculous No I would rather	164.62554931640625
23357/28840	Seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in Paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his	69.8521499633789
23358/28840	I do this Oh my God said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for	102.86173248291016
23359/28840	I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like Morcerf Danglars Villefort even Morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their	75.21456909179688
23360/28840	Let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by Providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for	80.15514373779297
23361/28840	While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertaintieswretched waking dreams of griefthe first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of	92.09420013427734
23362/28840	It was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his	39.848690032958984
23363/28840	He turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its	62.13584518432617
23364/28840	He arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw Haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown	37.695858001708984
23365/28840	She had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with	120.53971862792969
23366/28840	The noise of the door did not awaken her and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate	57.26288604736328
23367/28840	She remembered that she had a son said he and I forgot I had a	65.19224548339844
23368/28840	Then shaking his head sorrowfully Poor Haydée said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed	69.2361831665039
23369/28840	Oh I cannot go without taking leave of her I cannot die without confiding her to	101.08931732177734
23370/28840	These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at Monte Cristo of which Bertuccio knows the	76.80216217041016
23371/28840	40241m       He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his	32.68906021118164
23372/28840	Well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled	49.076927185058594
23373/28840	Well if any misfortune happen to me replied Monte Cristo I wish my daughter to be	21.456382751464844
23374/28840	Haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her	110.34868621826172
23375/28840	Do you think of dying my lord said	61.43009948730469
23376/28840	The wise man my child has said It is good to think of	107.14600372314453
23377/28840	Well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die I shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the	68.73047637939453
23378/28840	Then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the	143.40782165527344
23379/28840	Alas murmured he with intense suffering I might then have been happy	139.22793579101562
23380/28840	Then he carried Haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed	124.83822631835938
23381/28840	As he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was	34.28700637817383
23382/28840	Monte Cristo approached the window and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel al	47.490474700927734
23383/28840	Good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three	196.8671875
23384/28840	A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door	47.358436584472656
23385/28840	Morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time	102.73825073242188
23386/28840	I am perhaps come too soon count said he but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my	98.26805114746094
23387/28840	I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover	119.61353302001953
23388/28840	Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open	52.61465072631836
23389/28840	Morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that I am beloved by such a man as	27.18630027770996
23390/28840	Goodmorning Emmanuel you will come with me then Maximilian   Did you doubt it said the young	35.64369201660156
23391/28840	But if I were wrong   I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday I have been thinking of your firmness all night and I said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied	53.92726135253906
23392/28840	But Morrel Albert is your friend   Simply an acquaintance	86.40635681152344
23393/28840	You met on the same day you first saw me   Yes that is true but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded	38.32451629638672
23394/28840	said he to Ali who came immediately take that to my	292.1944885253906
23395/28840	When I am dead you will go and examine	60.99443435668945
23396/28840	What said Morrel you dead   Yes must I not be prepared for everything dear friend But what did you do yesterday after you left me   I went to Tortonis where as I expected I found Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	30.209453582763672
23397/28840	Why when all was arranged   Listen count the affair is serious and	132.7790069580078
23398/28840	Did you doubt it   No the offence was public and everyone is already talking of	92.688232421875
23399/28840	Well   Well I hoped to get an exchange of armsto substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is	182.18955993652344
23400/28840	Have you succeeded asked Monte Cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of	35.92703628540039
23401/28840	No for your skill with the sword is so well	82.44668579101562
23402/28840	Ahwho has betrayed me   The skilful swordsman whom you have	51.675941467285156
23403/28840	And you failed   They positively	321.0079345703125
23404/28840	Morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol  	48.806671142578125
23405/28840	Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the	55.73402404785156
23406/28840	He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than bucks	46.68274688720703
23407/28840	Then turning towards Monte Cristo Count said he in the name of all that is dear to you I entreat you not to kill Albertthe unhappy youth has a	49.61856460571289
23408/28840	You are right said Monte Cristo and I have	15.197867393493652
23409/28840	These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel	68.84895324707031
23410/28840	Doubtless what does that imply   That you will fire	141.68923950195312
23411/28840	I fire first   Oh I obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us	81.32435607910156
23412/28840	And at what distance   Twenty p	129.59271240234375
23413/28840	A smile of terrible import passed over the counts	216.2655029296875
23414/28840	Morrel said he do not forget what you have just	32.271793365478516
23415/28840	The only chance for Alberts safety then will arise from your	153.29408264160156
23416/28840	I suffer from emotion said Monte Crist	71.05843353271484
23417/28840	Or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are I may say what would appear absurd to	127.97938537597656
23418/28840	What is that   Break his armwound himbut do not kill	78.17073059082031
23419/28840	I will tell you Morrel said the count that I do not need entreating to spare the life of	31.31405258178711
23420/28840	de Morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while I   And you   That will be another thing I shall be brought	43.3057746887207
23421/28840	No no cried Maximilian quite unable to restrain his	64.82413482666016
23422/28840	As I told you my dear Morrel	26.508960723876953
23423/28840	Morrel looked at him in utter amaz	30.14116668701172
23424/28840	But what has happened then since last evening count   The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi I have seen a	79.82212829589844
23425/28840	And that ghost   Told me Morrel that I had lived long	99.1441879272461
23426/28840	Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each	11.94629955291748
23427/28840	Let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight o	55.182762145996094
23428/28840	A carriage was in readiness at the	51.93042755126953
23429/28840	Monte Cristo stepped into it with his two	90.41056060791016
23430/28840	He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and Maximilian and Emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from	90.49549102783203
23431/28840	As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of	55.367530822753906
23432/28840	We are first said Morrel looking out of the	77.2723617553711
23433/28840	Excuse me sir said Baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but I think I see a carriage down there under the	46.90119552612305
23434/28840	Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximil	45.08903503417969
23435/28840	The latter retained the counts hand between	91.19947814941406
23436/28840	I like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his	99.04991149902344
23437/28840	It seems to me said Emmanuel that I see two young men down there who are evidently	104.54765319824219
23438/28840	Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brotherin	92.63565826416016
23439/28840	Maximilian said he are your affections disengaged Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with aston	28.561016082763672
23440/28840	I do not seek your confidence my dear	28.49306869506836
23441/28840	I only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all I	85.51749420166016
23442/28840	Do you love her much   More than my	76.95767211914062
23443/28840	Then with a sigh Poor Haydée murmured	32.614715576171875
23444/28840	To tell the truth count if I knew less of you I should think that you were less brave than you	77.42601013183594
23445/28840	Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving Come Morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of	105.95388793945312
23446/28840	Do I regret life What is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death Moreover do not alarm yourself Morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you	113.14451599121094
23447/28840	I know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor	108.2275619506836
23448/28840	Have you brought your arms   Iwhat for I hope these gentlemen have	108.39335632324219
23449/28840	Do but make no treatyyou understand me   You need not	65.02517700195312
23450/28840	Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud who seeing his intention came to meet	16.11547088623047
23451/28840	The three young men bowed to each other courteously if not aff	106.97998809814453
23452/28840	Excuse me gentlemen said Morrel but I do not see	44.177066802978516
23453/28840	He sent us word this morning replied ChâteauRenaud that he would meet us on the	39.355491638183594
23454/28840	It is only five minutes past eight said he to Morrel there is not much time lost	91.92296600341797
23455/28840	Oh I made no allusion of that kind replied Mor	53.812564849853516
23456/28840	There is a carriage coming said ChâteauRen	16.666048049926758
23457/28840	It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were	57.37965393066406
23458/28840	You are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen	246.60391235351562
23459/28840	de Monte Cristo yields his right of using	94.13367462158203
23460/28840	We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said Beauchamp and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar	71.18048858642578
23461/28840	They are quite new and have not yet been	225.2355499267578
23462/28840	Beauchamp if you assure me that	71.84341430664062
23463/28840	de Morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite	51.93472671508789
23464/28840	Gentlemen said ChâteauRenaud it is not Morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is Franz and Debray   The two young men he announced were indeed	41.86674499511719
23465/28840	What chance brings you here gentlemen said ChâteauRenaud shaking hands with each of	31.68145179748535
23466/28840	Because said Debray Albert sent this morning to request us to	86.59402465820312
23467/28840	Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud exchanged looks of aston	16.75581169128418
23468/28840	I think I understand his reason said Mor	48.403282165527344
23469/28840	What is it   Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from	37.21705627441406
23470/28840	de Morcerf begging me to attend the	77.9892349243164
23471/28840	And we too added Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	16.142000198364258
23472/28840	Having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the	166.90406799316406
23473/28840	Exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed	124.17745208740234
23474/28840	But after all these arrangements he does not come himself said ChâteauRen	26.202823638916016
23475/28840	There he comes said Beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a	29.384824752807617
23476/28840	How imprudent said ChâteauRenaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions I had given	32.57650375366211
23477/28840	And besides said Beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat Why has he not painted a spot upon his heartit would have been more	68.082763671875
23478/28840	Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young	53.55406188964844
23479/28840	He jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined	60.451419830322266
23480/28840	He was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not	31.707490921020508
23481/28840	A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to	91.8464126586914
23482/28840	I thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request I feel extremely grateful for this mark of	72.666748046875
23483/28840	Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached and remained at a short	52.169376373291016
23484/28840	40248m       Sir said Maximilian you are not perhaps aware that I am	10.836137771606445
23485/28840	de Monte Cristos friend   I was not sure but I thought it might be	33.650997161865234
23486/28840	So much the better the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be	74.97962188720703
23487/28840	Morrel said ChâteauRenaud will you apprise the Count of Monte Cristo that	11.971518516540527
23488/28840	de Morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal   Morrel was preparing to fulfil his	45.867774963378906
23489/28840	Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the	162.7783660888672
23490/28840	Stop gentlemen said Albert I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Crist	21.332372665405273
23491/28840	No sir before all who are	141.4481658935547
23492/28840	Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper and Morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with	54.93442916870117
23493/28840	What does he want with me said Monte Crist	16.832782745361328
23494/28840	I do not know but he wishes to speak to	12.658074378967285
23495/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo I trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult   I do not think that such is his intention said Mor	30.732101440429688
23496/28840	The count advanced accompanied by Maximilian and	106.32131958007812
23497/28840	His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Alberts griefstricken face who approached also followed by the other four young	109.16975402832031
23498/28840	When at three paces distant from each other Albert and the count	59.2402458190918
23499/28840	Sir said Albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer I reproached you with exposing the conduct of	67.1998291015625
23500/28840	de Morcerf in Epirus for guilty as I knew he was I thought you had no right to punish him but I have since learned that you had that	53.57823944091797
23501/28840	Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did Alberts	35.279388427734375
23502/28840	As for Monte Cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite	27.459186553955078
23503/28840	He could not understand how Alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this	57.0821418762207
23504/28840	He recognized the influence of Mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be	57.49144744873047
23505/28840	Now sir said Albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your	112.61502838134766
23506/28840	Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess I rank that of candidly acknowledging a	144.35379028320312
23507/28840	I acted well as a man but you have acted better than	70.15596771240234
23508/28840	An angel alone could have saved one of us from deaththat angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each	143.14630126953125
23509/28840	Monte Cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful	148.55845642089844
23510/28840	I hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience	103.9134292602539
23511/28840	But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies I shall endeavor to correct his	94.04417419433594
23512/28840	What happened during the night asked Beauchamp of ChâteauRenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure	32.38724899291992
23513/28840	In truth what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the bar	110.42769622802734
23514/28840	What can it mean said Debray to	55.08609390258789
23515/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to	40.95081329345703

23517/28840	As for Monte Cristo his head was bent down his arms were	59.33633804321289
23518/28840	Mother and Son   The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with Maximilian and	26.241806030273438
23519/28840	Albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just	62.238502502441406
23520/28840	Indeed my dear friend said Beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhopedfor conclusion of a very disagreeable	35.94924545288086
23521/28840	Albert remained silent and wrapped in	130.11878967285156
23522/28840	ChâteauRenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible	28.903064727783203
23523/28840	Are we not going said he after this embarrassing	97.47928619384766
23524/28840	When you please replied Beauchamp allow me only to compliment	71.252685546875
23525/28840	de Morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric	98.75139617919922
23526/28840	It is magnificent continued Beauchamp to be able to exercise so much selfcontrol   Assuredly as for me I should have been incapable of it said ChâteauRenaud with most significant cool	29.341392517089844
23527/28840	Gentlemen interrupted Albert I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between	142.9818115234375

23531/28840	de ChâteauRenaud   40252m       That is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsw	22.9499568939209
23532/28840	Thank you gentlemen replied Albert with a smile of indifference I shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because I had before intended to quit	71.4454116821289
23533/28840	I thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my	67.95621490478516
23534/28840	It is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said I remember that	64.0234146118164
23535/28840	Goodbye Albert said Beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young	29.837934494018555
23536/28840	The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered	54.81513595581055
23537/28840	Goodbye said ChâteauRenaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his	25.179786682128906
23538/28840	Alberts lips scarcely whispered Goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous	234.8688507080078
23539/28840	He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of	67.96061706542969
23540/28840	In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du He	14.4075345993042
23541/28840	As he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts	49.214290618896484
23542/28840	Albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own	35.18212127685547
23543/28840	He cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter	95.42504119873047
23544/28840	Then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and	113.15190124511719
23545/28840	At the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his	154.68849182128906
23546/28840	What do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry	44.54566955566406
23547/28840	Pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the Count of Morcerf has called	26.850614547729492
23548/28840	I did not like to go to him without first seeing	45.500694274902344
23549/28840	Why   Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the meeting this	45.61322021484375
23550/28840	40254m       It is probable said	12.032463073730469
23551/28840	And since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened	76.93804168701172
23552/28840	What must I answer   The	60.29495620727539
23553/28840	Then I shall say the duel did not take place   You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Crist	27.645488739013672
23554/28840	The valet bowed and retired and Albert returned to his	77.751953125
23555/28840	As he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his	86.5595474243164
23556/28840	He approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive	117.4406509399414
23557/28840	The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mothers room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the	79.23683166503906
23558/28840	As if the same idea had animated these two beings Mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in	46.4154167175293
23559/28840	Everything was in orderlaces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the	143.92092895507812
23560/28840	Albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming My mother he threw his arms around her	97.37136840820312
23561/28840	The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful	117.38247680664062
23562/28840	All these proofs of an energetic resolution which Albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his	80.43257141113281
23563/28840	Oh my mother exclaimed Albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and meyou cannot have made the same resolution I have for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house andand to	65.8672103881836
23564/28840	I also replied Mercédès am going and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me have I deceived myself   Mother said Albert with firm	57.23196029663086
23565/28840	I cannot make you share the fate I have planned for	56.90516662597656
23566/28840	I must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned	102.45401763916016
23567/28840	So my dear mother I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present	73.29890441894531
23568/28840	You my poor child suffer poverty and hunger Oh do not say so it will break my	163.3555450439453
23569/28840	I am young and strong I believe I am courageous and since yesterday I have learned the power of	50.82343673706055
23570/28840	No mother from this moment I have done with the past and accept nothing from itnot even a name because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before	68.2806625366211
23571/28840	Albert my child said Mercédès if I had a stronger heart that is the counsel I would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its	54.20918273925781
23572/28840	You had friends Albert break off their	560.1756591796875
23573/28840	But do not despair you have life before you my dear Albert for you are yet scarcely twentytwo years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fathersit was	128.05787658691406
23574/28840	I am sure my dear Albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name	77.99388122558594
23575/28840	Then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if I am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for I have no future to look forward	92.12525177001953
23576/28840	For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this	121.7688980102539
23577/28840	I will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young	30.402381896972656
23578/28840	Yes I share your hopes the anger of Heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and I am	87.82791900634766
23579/28840	But since our resolution is formed let us act	230.9986572265625
23580/28840	de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an	55.5272216796875
23581/28840	I am ready my son said Mercédè	12.47948932647705
23582/28840	He recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue des SaintsPères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the count	62.42527770996094
23583/28840	As the carriage stopped at the door and Albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a	27.161945343017578
23584/28840	Albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for Bertuccio but he was	52.077083587646484
23585/28840	He returned to Mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the	23.884727478027344
23586/28840	Mercédès read   AlbertWhile showing you that I have discovered your plans I hope also to convince you of my delic	28.775455474853516
23587/28840	You are free you leave the counts house and you take your mother to your home but reflect Albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay	118.12690734863281
23588/28840	I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking anything with	30.995542526245117
23589/28840	Do not seek to know how I discovered it I know itthat is	95.69219207763672
23590/28840	Twentyfour years ago I returned proud and joyful to my	137.49635314941406
23591/28840	I had a betrothed Albert a lovely girl whom I adored and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless to	53.48735046386719
23592/28840	This money was for her I destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles on the Allées de Meil	51.1111946105957
23593/28840	Your mother Albert knows that poor house	662.96533203125
23594/28840	A short time since I passed through Marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my	53.582557678222656
23595/28840	The iron box was thereno one had touched itunder a beautiful figtree my father had planted the day I was born which overshadowed the	158.7455596923828
23596/28840	Well Albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same	124.7699203491211
23597/28840	Oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I	163.20388793945312
23598/28840	Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this	106.7782211303711
23599/28840	Mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards	18.962541580200195

23602/28840	Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of	62.9598388671875
23603/28840	Morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brotherinlaws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his count	81.37210845947266
23604/28840	At the Barrière du Trône they met Bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his	52.01974868774414

23607/28840	If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said Morrel I would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to	94.51427459716797
23608/28840	So we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten	50.63758087158203

23615/28840	Have you not thought so   Yes said Monte Cristo for that reason I wished to keep you near	30.827119827270508
23616/28840	It is miraculous continued Morrel answering his own	196.07052612304688
23617/28840	Yes said the Count you are rightit is	42.195133209228516
23618/28840	Very brave said Monte Cristo I have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his	36.906951904296875
23619/28840	And I know he has fought two duels said Mor	100.2779541015625
23620/28840	How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning   All owing to your influence replied Monte Cristo	63.12171173095703
23621/28840	It is well for Albert he is not in the army said Mor	54.21599578857422
23622/28840	Why   An apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his	28.351308822631836
23623/28840	Doubtless doubtless said Morrel but I shall say like the Spaniard He has not been so brave today as he was	84.15097045898438

23629/28840	Now after what you told me this morning of your heart I may believe   Well count replied Morrel gayly I will not dispute	44.14091491699219
23630/28840	But you will not make me your confidant Maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the	26.892559051513672
23631/28840	I showed you this morning that I had a heart did I not count Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young	40.53397750854492
23632/28840	Well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes it is elsewhere and I must go and find	33.67437744140625

23645/28840	Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly	152.208740234375
23646/28840	Monte Cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two Mercédès in the world and he might yet be	32.3315315246582
23647/28840	His eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of Haydée when suddenly the door	109.88687896728516
23648/28840	de Morcerf said Baptistin as if that name sufficed for his	50.7962760925293
23649/28840	Which asked he the viscount or the count   The	36.540470123291016
23650/28840	Oh exclaimed Haydée is it not yet over   I know not if it is finished my beloved child said Monte Cristo taking the young girls hands but I do know you have nothing more to	26.388761520385742
23651/28840	But it is the wretched   That man cannot injure me Haydée said Monte Cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to	33.29895782470703
23652/28840	And what I have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my	35.72747802734375
23653/28840	By my fathers tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl I swear to you Haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to	21.416166305541992
23654/28840	I believe you my lord as implicitly as if God had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to	39.8958625793457
23655/28840	Monte Cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other	167.97178649902344
23656/28840	Oh murmured the count shall I then be permitted to love again Ask	102.29351043701172
23657/28840	de Morcerf into the drawingroom said he to Baptistin while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private	37.11085510253906
23658/28840	We must explain this visit which although expected by Monte Cristo is unexpected to our	175.69078063964844
23659/28840	He who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in Madame de Morcerfs	84.52928161621094
23660/28840	From that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the	76.94005584716797
23661/28840	He remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own	74.09026336669922
23662/28840	For him those ten minutes were very	358.7572937011719
23663/28840	It was then Albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned	123.865966796875
23664/28840	The counts eye expanded he knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly	109.7588882446289
23665/28840	Albert returned safelythen the count was reven	158.2407989501953
23666/28840	An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a	83.31029510498047
23667/28840	But as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his	54.86876678466797
23668/28840	Ten minutes afterwards General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black	49.102500915527344
23669/28840	He had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coachhouse ready for	117.52597045898438
23670/28840	The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coach	52.93185806274414
23671/28840	The coachman stooped down for his	92.04669189453125
23672/28840	To the ChampsÉlysées said the general the Count of Monte Crist	10.641341209411621
23673/28840	Hurry   The horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the counts	75.37638854980469
23674/28840	de Morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his	56.953460693359375
23675/28840	A moment afterwards Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo and the latter leading Haydée aside ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawing	50.67076110839844
23676/28840	The general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived Monte Cristo at the	62.062320709228516
23677/28840	de Morcerf said Monte Cristo quietly I thought I had not heard ar	20.99495506286621
23678/28840	Yes it is I said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating	57.529075622558594
23679/28840	May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing	80.19295501708984
23680/28840	de Morcerf so early   Had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the	58.519371032714844
23681/28840	And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill	58.19602584838867
23682/28840	Yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even	45.33110427856445
23683/28840	Yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my	58.94792556762695
23684/28840	It is true sir said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the	55.810665130615234
23685/28840	Doubtless you made then some apology or explanation   I explained nothing and it is he who apologized to	101.448486328125
23686/28840	But to what do you attribute this conduct   To the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than	75.17648315429688
23687/28840	And who was that   His	71.5416259765625
23688/28840	That may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves	56.19539260864258
23689/28840	I know it and I expected this	89.67683410644531
23690/28840	You expected my son would be a coward cried the	49.2001953125
23691/28840	Albert de Morcerf is no coward said Monte Crist	20.618091583251953
23692/28840	Albert that and he may know what to answer	136.15521240234375
23693/28840	Oh no no said the general smiling faintly I did not come for that purpose you are	67.8656005859375
23694/28840	I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my	39.79576873779297
23695/28840	I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively that it seems as if I had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do	45.524906158447266
23696/28840	Do you think so sir  	38.10028839111328
23697/28840	And when I told you I had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit I alluded	38.14811706542969
23698/28840	Are you prepared   Yes	31.310678482055664
23699/28840	You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with	77.74146270751953
23700/28840	40262m       Until one of us dies repeated Monte Cristo moving his head slightly up and	26.977859497070312
23701/28840	Let us start then we need no	410.07623291015625
23702/28840	Very true said Monte Cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well   On the contrary said the count we know so little of each	32.25133514404297
23703/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us	31.369348526000977
23704/28840	I know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch I know not every page of my life but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous cover	68.14025115966797
23705/28840	Nono I am aware you know me but I know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jew	79.33112335205078
23706/28840	You call yourself in Paris the Count of Monte Cristo in Italy Sinbad the Sailor in Malta I forget	30.91822052001953
23707/28840	But it is your real name I want to know in the midst of your hundred names that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when I plunge my sword through your	48.30192947387695
23708/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring	42.62651443481445
23709/28840	He leaped towards a dressingroom near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black	65.66055297851562
23710/28840	The fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness	116.30960845947266
23711/28840	He stopped at a short distance from the house and alight	23.0102481842041
23712/28840	The door was wide open a hackneycoach was standing in the middle of the yarda strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his	85.45455169677734
23713/28840	Two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid	82.4180679321289
23714/28840	It was Mercédès leaning on her sons arm and leaving the	21.903413772583008
23715/28840	The general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and	56.527435302734375
23716/28840	He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the	51.24475860595703
23717/28840	And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the	52.24834442138672
23718/28840	Valentine   We may easily conceive where Morrels appointment	32.00623321533203
23719/28840	He knew his time wellthe hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious	111.649658203125
23720/28840	Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that	52.888118743896484
23721/28840	Uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her	62.073951721191406
23722/28840	This uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report Morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the Opera was generally	61.89421463012695
23723/28840	No one at Villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from	70.49264526367188
23724/28840	Valentine with her womans instinct guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to	50.80892562866211
23725/28840	We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was	67.91785430908203
23726/28840	Now said Valentine motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own	53.597835540771484
23727/28840	You know Maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an apartment away from	76.37578582763672
23728/28840	Yes said Maximilian I recollect the project of which I highly	28.02248191833496
23729/28840	Well said Valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of	65.62731170654297
23730/28840	40272m       And do you know said Valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this	30.475971221923828
23731/28840	Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for Mor	71.66942596435547
23732/28840	Noirtiers reason answered Morrel I can readily believe it to be a good	42.29241943359375
23733/28840	He pretends the air of the Faubourg SaintHonoré is not good for	19.396163940429688
23734/28840	Noirtier may be right you have not seemed to be well for the last	51.88444137573242
23735/28840	And grandpapa has become my physician and I have the greatest confidence in him because he knows	40.37202072143555
23736/28840	Do you then really suffer asked Morrel	167.8511199951172
23737/28840	Oh it must not be called suffering I feel a general uneasiness that is	51.36804962158203
23738/28840	I have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to	64.54383087158203
23739/28840	Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine	31.603347778320312
23740/28840	And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint   A very simple one said	91.0863037109375
23741/28840	I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my	137.68975830078125
23742/28840	When I say one spoonful I began by onenow I take	377.77508544921875
23743/28840	Valentine smiled but it was evident that she	44.56032943725586
23744/28840	Maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at	128.4209747314453
23745/28840	She was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish	80.05106353759766
23746/28840	From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirt	41.892704010009766
23747/28840	The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like Morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the	105.0827865600586
23748/28840	But said Morrel I thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for	69.32723236083984
23749/28840	Noirtier   I know it is very bitter said Valentine so bitter that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same	74.43352508544922
23750/28840	Yes grandpapa said Valentine it is	24.957324981689453
23751/28840	Just now before I came down to you I drank a glass of sugared water I left half because it seemed so	175.2456512451172
23752/28840	Noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to	15.391402244567871
23753/28840	In fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming	166.25186157226562
23754/28840	Oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular I cant see Did the sun shine in my eyes And she leaned against the	153.20777893066406
23755/28840	The sun is not shining said Morrel more alarmed by Noirtiers expression than by Valentines indis	92.32402038574219
23756/28840	Do not be alarmed Maximilian it is nothing and has already passed	68.9787826538086
23757/28840	But listen Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard She opened Noirtiers door ran to a window in the passage and returned	92.63229370117188
23758/28840	Yes said she it is Madame Danglars and her daughter who have come to call on	20.004138946533203
23759/28840	GoodbyeI must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till I see you	120.77532958984375
23760/28840	Stay with grandpapa Maximilian I promise you not to persuade them to	46.702030181884766
23761/28840	40274m       Morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villeforts apartments and to	28.928049087524414
23762/28840	As soon as she was gone Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the	26.752405166625977
23763/28840	Morrel obeyed guided by Valentine he had learned how to understand the old man	70.70051574707031
23764/28840	Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barroiss situation and in Noirtiers name gave that	87.34071350097656
23765/28840	The decanter and the glass were completely	80.2048110961914
23766/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he wished to	10.896493911743164
23767/28840	Why are the glass and decanter empty asked he Valentine said she only drank half the glass	215.18673706054688
23768/28840	The translation of this new question occupied another five	542.7783203125
23769/28840	I do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentines room perhaps she has emptied	28.208477020263672
23770/28840	Ask her said Morrel translating Noirtiers thought this time by his	72.30931091308594
23771/28840	The servant went out but returned almost	334.503173828125
23772/28840	Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his	54.028602600097656
23773/28840	Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one	79.05775451660156
23774/28840	From that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit	23.927160263061523
23775/28840	It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen they had been ushered into Madame de Villeforts room who had said she would receive them	32.662574768066406
23776/28840	That is why Valentine passed through her room which was on a level with Valentines and only separated from it by	104.6307373046875
23777/28840	The two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal	127.90335845947266
23778/28840	Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemn	51.879642486572266
23779/28840	Valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were	58.2733039855957
23780/28840	My dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalc	35.85043716430664
23781/28840	Danglars kept up the title of	44.66914749145508
23782/28840	The popular banker found that it answered better than	605.1829833984375
23783/28840	Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied Madame de Ville	40.6463623046875
23784/28840	Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare	48.562625885009766
23785/28840	40276m       Listen said the baroness smiling speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will	18.30356216430664
23786/28840	He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize at first sight the Italian or German noble	190.7294464111328
23787/28840	Besides he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition much keenness of wit and as to suitability	284.21343994140625
23788/28840	Danglars assures me that his fortune is majesticthat is his	51.00532531738281
23789/28840	And then said Eugénie while turning over the leaves of Madame de Villeforts album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young	26.75531578063965
23790/28840	And said Madame de Villefort I need not ask you if you share that	34.98564529418945
23791/28840	I replied Eugénie with her usual cand	31.444364547729492
23792/28840	Oh not the least in the world madame My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in	96.34513854980469
23793/28840	Eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentines	48.4329719543457

23807/28840	Deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the	75.5689926147461
23808/28840	She would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly Madame Danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her letharg	43.16565704345703

23817/28840	That poor child said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and I should not be astonished if she had some serious	50.94178771972656
23818/28840	Meanwhile Valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed Edwards room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little	87.67147064208984
23819/28840	Morrel bounded to the door opened it and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of the	41.50505828857422

23836/28840	The cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtiers lips seemed to start from his	45.18965530395508
23837/28840	Morrel understood it he knew he must call	199.87635803222656

23861/28840	The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristos	38.22639465332031
23862/28840	The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in	67.7431640625

23885/28840	You know I am waiting said Monte Cristo	21.80377769470215

23887/28840	Two persons passed near meallow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet I was so interested in what they said that I did not lose a single	42.25339889526367
23888/28840	This is a gloomy introduction if I may judge from your pallor and shuddering Mor	72.86177825927734
23889/28840	Someone had just died in the house to which that garden	156.22312927246094
23890/28840	One of the persons whose conversation I overheard was the master of the house the other the	71.31243896484375
23891/28840	The former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of Gods	125.36006164550781
23892/28840	Ah indeed said Monte Cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilians	43.34735107421875
23893/28840	Yes continued Morrel death had entered that house twice within one	256.64007568359375
23894/28840	And what did the doctor answer asked Monte Crist	77.83519744873047
23895/28840	He repliedhe replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed   To what   To	105.25323486328125
23896/28840	Monte Cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calm	80.85147857666016
23897/28840	Well said Maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a	76.76654052734375
23898/28840	Death is now perhaps striking a fourth	230.75535583496094
23899/28840	Count what am I bound to do being in possession of this secret   My dear friend said Monte Cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by	45.6923713684082
23900/28840	I know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden	126.8577880859375
23901/28840	Well I have not intercepted your confidence and yet I know all that as well as you and I have no conscientious scru	26.850313186645508
23902/28840	You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to Gods angerwell who says your supposition is not reality Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass	121.9698486328125
23903/28840	If it is Gods justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house Maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its	134.27853393554688
23904/28840	There was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts	88.31014251708984
23905/28840	Besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speakingbesides who says that it will begin again   It has returned count exclaimed Morrel that is why I hastened to	59.26383590698242

23907/28840	de Villeforts garden from what you relate I suppose it to have been the evening of Madame de SaintMérans	37.906089782714844
23908/28840	de SaintMéran and that no less surprising of the count	27.10521125793457
23909/28840	dAvrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this	108.03142547607422

23912/28840	Deep grief was depicted on Morrels features he seized Monte Cristos	90.65097045898438
23913/28840	They will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of	138.78489685058594

23916/28840	As for Monte Cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal	34.233680725097656
23917/28840	In a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the suns genial influence when the cloud has	75.15437316894531
23918/28840	This silence selfcontrol and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid	169.8252410888672

23931/28840	But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that Maximilian felt the tears filling his	28.39092445373535
23932/28840	I can do much for you my friend replied the	20.746706008911133
23933/28840	Morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo exercised over everything around him did not endeavor to resist	65.76636505126953
23934/28840	He pressed the counts hand and	70.73413848876953
23935/28840	He stopped one moment at the door for Baptistin whom he saw in the Rue Matignon and who was	44.52999496459961
23936/28840	Villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the	52.75354766845703
23937/28840	Noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than Villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affection	45.802696228027344
23938/28840	At last dAvrigny slowly uttered these words She is still alive   Still cried Villefort oh doctor what a dreadful word is	42.35985565185547
23939/28840	Yes said the physician I repeat it she is still alive and I am astonished at	36.56971740722656
23940/28840	But is she safe asked the	215.40911865234375
23941/28840	At that moment dAvrignys glance met Noirtiers	51.18832778930664
23942/28840	It glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was	97.34825134277344

23945/28840	Villefort went himself to find her and dAvrigny approached Noirt	20.00699806213379
23946/28840	Have you something to tell me asked	115.62932586669922
23947/28840	The old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his	127.8110580444336
23948/28840	At this moment Villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came Madame de Ville	32.92668533325195
23949/28840	What is the matter then with this dear child she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but I did not think seriously of	40.4674072265625
23950/28840	The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached Valentine and took her	70.22257232666016
23951/28840	DAvrigny continued to look at Noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his	68.84339904785156
23952/28840	Ah said he involuntarily following Noirtiers eyes which were fixed on Madame de Villefort who repeated   This poor child would be better in	34.12960433959961
23953/28840	Come Fanny we will put her to	157.10528564453125
23954/28840	dAvrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with Noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he	47.21250915527344
23955/28840	They carried Valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the	253.32244873046875
23956/28840	She had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very	140.19009399414062
23957/28840	DAvrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters	104.03205871582031
23958/28840	We have no time to lose I will question and do you answer	56.823822021484375
23959/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to	12.809683799743652
23960/28840	Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter  	34.122615814208984
23961/28840	DAvrigny reflected a moment then approaching Noirtier   Pardon what I am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible	62.55561065673828
23962/28840	Did you see poor Barrois die Noirtier raised his eyes to	33.43751907348633
23963/28840	Do you know of what he died asked dAvrigny placing his hand on Noirtiers	19.161882400512695
23964/28840	Do you think he died a natural death A sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of Noirt	88.66246032714844
23965/28840	Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned  	41.376712799072266
23966/28840	Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him  	114.7078857421875
23967/28840	Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now attacked Valentine  	78.01419067382812
23968/28840	Then will she die too asked dAvrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on Noirt	31.500747680664062
23969/28840	He watched the effect of this question on the old	69.08770751953125
23970/28840	No replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever div	53.76320266723633
23971/28840	Then you hope said dAvrigny with	29.280546188354492
23972/28840	What do you hope The old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not	52.194644927978516
23973/28840	Ah yes it is true murmured dAvrign	13.104517936706543
23974/28840	Then turning to NoirtierDo you hope the assassin will be tried  	47.14714431762695
23975/28840	Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine  	101.64173889160156
23976/28840	It is no news to you added dAvrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the	42.1298713684082
23977/28840	Then how do you hope Valentine will escape   Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same	37.34236145019531
23978/28840	DAvrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every	99.39298248291016
23979/28840	Ah indeed said dAvrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to youNoirtier did not let him	60.60010528564453
23980/28840	To prepare her system to resist poison  	148.3944091796875
23981/28840	By accustoming her by degrees   Yes yes yes said Noirtier delighted to be	40.61678695678711
23982/28840	I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give	26.528484344482422
23983/28840	And by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison Noirtiers joy	67.8431167602539
23984/28840	Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance could have been proc	166.06219482421875
23985/28840	The dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate Valentine will not	71.61346435546875
23986/28840	A superhuman joy expanded the old mans eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite	48.56148147583008
23987/28840	Here doctor said he is what you sent me	70.84748840332031
23988/28840	Was this prepared in your presence   Yes replied the procure	33.68745040893555
23989/28840	Have you not let it go out of your hands  	40.537776947021484
23990/28840	DAvrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed	103.79180145263672
23991/28840	Well said he let us go to Valentine I will give instructions to everyone and you	73.28929901123047
23992/28840	de Villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from	93.52194213867188
23993/28840	40294m       At the moment when dAvrigny was returning to Valentines room accompanied by Villefort an Italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of	41.44644546508789
23994/28840	No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left	139.5206756591797
23995/28840	About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o	82.17073059082031
23996/28840	The lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in	65.45745086669922
23997/28840	This new tenant who as we have said was an Italian was called Il Signor Giacomo Bus	52.06228256225586
23998/28840	Workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering	71.56608581542969
23999/28840	This formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be	83.78492736816406
24000/28840	We beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner Baron Dangl	68.71562957763672
24001/28840	In this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every	59.17996597290039
24002/28840	When his patience was exhausted he called his val	132.50848388671875
24003/28840	Étienne said he see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawingroom and why she makes me wait so	40.433902740478516
24004/28840	Having given this vent to his illhumor the baron became more calm Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawingroom as the	51.57480239868164
24005/28840	The singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing	84.5525894165039
24006/28840	Mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here	71.71218872070312
24007/28840	Danglars nodded to signify that he was	25.646942138671875
24008/28840	To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the goodnatured man and the indulgent	37.782901763916016
24009/28840	Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering	99.20609283447266
24010/28840	I will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least	93.17576599121094
24011/28840	I have chosen the drawingroom sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankers	82.62434387207031
24012/28840	I have therefore chosen this drawingroom where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastor	112.45555877685547
24013/28840	I rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but I should be no artist if I had not some f	85.13292694091797
24014/28840	There is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said Eugénie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the	156.90696716308594
24015/28840	Now let us return to the	43.36330032348633
24016/28840	You ask me why I have requested this interview I will tell you in two words sir I will not marry count Andrea Cavalc	59.672367095947266
24017/28840	Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards	13.286856651306152
24018/28840	However this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice	114.55925750732422
24019/28840	Well sir replied Eugénie I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is	35.7218132019043
24020/28840	Well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no	66.25668334960938

24022/28840	It is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which I consider quite beneath	97.26203918457031
24023/28840	I actually love no one sir you know it do you not I do not then see why without real necessity I should encumber my life with a perpetual	116.6820068359375

24025/28840	Well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesI cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and I remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly	99.1949234008789
24026/28840	Unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured Danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly	79.28668975830078
24027/28840	Unhappy girl replied Eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir No indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and	160.40220642089844
24028/28840	Happy on the contrary for what am I in want of The world calls me	158.64317321777344
24029/28840	It is something to be well	110.57433319091797
24030/28840	I like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so	106.111328125
24031/28840	I possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all I meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its	88.07695770263672
24032/28840	I am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in	48.58659744262695

24034/28840	Besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur	63.1438102722168
24035/28840	Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute	68.4883804321289
24036/28840	Truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing I will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess	102.9530029296875
24037/28840	Eugénie looked at Danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be	67.4141845703125
24038/28840	My daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall	91.96632385253906

24040/28840	My daughter continued Danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to	83.91927337646484
24041/28840	Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their	105.52103424072266
24042/28840	This is not my weakness I tell you at once family joys have no charm for	113.91963958740234
24043/28840	I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a	94.07189178466797
24044/28840	This is not to the purpose said Eugénie let us speak candidly sir I admire cand	47.627838134765625
24045/28840	Oh said Danglars I can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general	103.1550064086914
24046/28840	40302m       It is just as I tell you I assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this	17.4300537109375
24047/28840	I do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and	77.58415222167969
24048/28840	But in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not	95.1900863647461
24049/28840	There one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility I will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and	89.79515075683594
24050/28840	de Monte Cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which I have never	37.33230972290039
24051/28840	There we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his	107.60132598876953
24052/28840	But Eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the	60.71461486816406
24053/28840	Exactly my daughter that is precisely what I mean said Danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruinedyes that is	70.29363250732422
24054/28840	Yes ruined Now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet	174.9710235595703
24055/28840	Now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect	114.75099182128906
24056/28840	Oh cried Eugénie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn	39.05659103393555
24057/28840	Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars Undeceive yourself again either I am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which will pass over without affecting	78.3164291381836

24066/28840	That is admirable said Eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the	73.42803192138672
24067/28840	You think I shall deprive you of those three millions said Danglars but do not fear	24.363935470581055
24068/28840	They are destined to produce at least	231.4031524658203
24069/28840	I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians in the fantastic Mississippi	131.93350219726562
24070/28840	As I look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the	82.42192077636719
24071/28840	We make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our	104.95028686523438

24073/28840	That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if I had employed it for another purpose I should bring on me a disgraceful	109.90868377685547

24079/28840	But since I tell you cried Danglars that with these three million   Do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million   I hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my	41.268733978271484
24080/28840	Shall you be able to pay	132.25006103515625
24081/28840	Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry   He shall receive them on returning from the mayors	73.63556671142578
24082/28840	Very well   What next what more do you want   I wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person  	52.57481002807617
24083/28840	Then as I said before sirvery well I am ready to marry	107.19031524658203
24084/28840	But what are you up to   Ah that is my	56.94647979736328

24087/28840	And to sign the contract in three days  	51.896827697753906
24088/28840	Then in my turn I also say very well   Danglars pressed his daughters hand in	31.048933029174805
24089/28840	But extraordinary to relate the father did not say Thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her	174.52947998046875
24090/28840	Is the conference ended asked Eugénie	134.05140686035156
24091/28840	Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to	17.659767150878906
24092/28840	Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle dArmillys fingers and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantios malediction on Desdem	31.116357803344727
24093/28840	At the end of the piece Étienne entered and announced to Eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her	28.82961654663086
24094/28840	We have seen them at Villeforts they proceeded then on their	84.56879425048828
24095/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a	77.94011688232422
24096/28840	He inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the	46.01800537109375
24097/28840	The count stopped on seeing the young	63.29363250732422
24098/28840	As for Andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped	130.49234008789062
24099/28840	Ah good morning my dear count said	68.98565673828125
24100/28840	Andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do   Charmingly as you	71.81036376953125
24101/28840	I am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned   I was going out	53.060028076171875
24102/28840	Then in order not to hinder you I will get up with you if you please in your carriage and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in	54.359886169433594
24103/28840	No said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young mans societyno I prefer listening to you here my dear	29.930316925048828
24104/28840	Andrea we can chat better indoors and there is no coachman to overhear our	127.37998962402344
24105/28840	The count returned to a small drawingroom on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat	40.77394485473633
24106/28840	You know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this	37.773277282714844
24107/28840	At nine oclock the contract is to be signed at my fatherin	37.86460494995117
24108/28840	What is it news to you Has not	171.749755859375
24109/28840	Danglars informed you of the ceremony   Oh yes said the count I received a letter from him yesterday but I do not think the hour was	27.238872528076172
24110/28840	Possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general	273.561767578125
24111/28840	Well said Monte Cristo you are fortunate	38.154075622558594
24112/28840	Cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome	36.95608139038086
24113/28840	Yes indeed she is replied Cavalcanti in a very modest	37.63276672363281
24114/28840	Above all she is very richat least I believe so said Monte Crist	51.42457580566406
24115/28840	Very rich do you think replied the young	32.33292007446289
24116/28840	Danglars conceals at least half of his	34.93125534057617
24117/28840	And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said Andrea with a look sparkling with	86.26802825927734
24118/28840	Without reckoning added Monte Cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England but quite novel in	49.44390869140625
24119/28840	Yes yes I know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not   Precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that	52.279457092285156
24120/28840	Ten millions Do you think so It is magnificent said Cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden	50.199790954589844
24121/28840	Without reckoning replied Monte Cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only	31.676624298095703
24122/28840	Besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrot	49.98554611206055
24123/28840	Andrea I think you have managed this affair rather skilfully   Not badly by any means said the young man I was born for a diplomat	53.46314239501953
24124/28840	Well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinct	63.70426559448242
24125/28840	Have you lost your heart   Indeed I fear it replied Andrea in the tone in which he had heard Dorante or Valère reply to Alceste21 at the Théâtre Franç	41.28372573852539
24126/28840	Is your love returned   I suppose so said Andrea with a triumphant smile since I am	63.645484924316406
24127/28840	But I must not forget one grand	230.33322143554688
24128/28840	Which   That I have been singularly	44.208763122558594
24129/28840	By circumstances   No by	81.30342102050781
24130/28840	By me Not at all prince said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have I done for you Are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient   No said Andreano it is useless for you to say so	62.401763916015625
24131/28840	I maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my	75.60856628417969
24132/28840	What encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers name so well known in Italy and so highly	132.47254943847656
24133/28840	This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken	96.99618530273438
24134/28840	Oh then my father has really a very large fortune count   It appears so sir replied Monte Crist	40.19253158569336
24135/28840	Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come   I have been advised of	54.09833908081055
24136/28840	But the three millions   The three millions are probably on the	58.56342315673828
24137/28840	Then I shall really have them   Oh well said the count I do not think you have yet known the want of	35.77507400512695
24138/28840	Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a	84.68892669677734
24139/28840	Then arousing from his reverie   Now sir I have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to	42.2542724609375
24140/28840	I have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of	100.36492156982422
24141/28840	I understand well I am come to ask a favor of	42.17512512207031
24142/28840	Of me   Yes of	60.980674743652344
24143/28840	And pray what may it be   Well to take his	82.4226303100586
24144/28840	I who have a seraglio at Cairo one at Smyrna and one at Constantinople preside at a weddingnever   Then you refuse me   Decidedly and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same	42.098995208740234
24145/28840	But what must be done said Andrea	98.32162475585938
24146/28840	You said just now that you had a hundred	47.08191680908203
24147/28840	Very true but you introduced me at	179.28543090820312
24148/28840	Not at all Let us recall the exact	227.77659606933594
24149/28840	You met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different	92.75897216796875
24150/28840	Yes but by my marriage you have forwarded	126.80148315429688
24151/28840	Inot in the least I beg you to	60.204200744628906
24152/28840	Recollect what I told you when you asked me to propose	56.162174224853516
24153/28840	Oh I never make matches my dear prince it is my settled	150.9364013671875
24154/28840	50025m       But at least you will be there   Will all Paris be there   Oh	20.476425170898438
24155/28840	Well like all Paris I shall be there too said the	63.66688537597656
24156/28840	And will you sign the contract   I see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus	45.14494705200195
24157/28840	Well since you will grant me no more I must be content with what you give	46.65208435058594
24158/28840	Be careful advice is worse than a	407.01910400390625
24159/28840	Oh you can give me this without compromising	93.33919525146484
24160/28840	Is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres   That is the sum	30.2653751373291
24161/28840	Because said Andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness I thought I heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just	48.42805099487305
24162/28840	Well replied Monte Cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve	74.76202392578125
24163/28840	Baron Danglars is a good father and knows how to	64.81783294677734
24164/28840	In that case said Andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves	74.99821472167969
24165/28840	You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar	192.7434844970703
24166/28840	Well said Andrea let it be as you	55.746463775634766
24167/28840	Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile Andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and	77.05248260498047
24168/28840	An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing	43.44038009643555
24169/28840	Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single	44.96784973144531
24170/28840	Her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest	182.6782684326172
24171/28840	Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	14.109234809875488
24172/28840	Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular	78.16309356689453
24173/28840	Danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the	73.0021743774414
24174/28840	The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and	73.4552001953125
24175/28840	As usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most	131.5106658935547
24176/28840	If there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a birdofparad	186.26687622070312
24177/28840	At each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different	84.781982421875
24178/28840	The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his	62.69655990600586
24179/28840	His only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waist	71.08324432373047
24180/28840	A circle was immediately formed around the	267.5628662109375
24181/28840	The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawingroom	47.47140121459961
24182/28840	Danglars at the other and Eugénie in front of	16.225025177001953
24183/28840	Near her was Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy which she intended immediately to make use	44.28113555908203
24184/28840	On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars who had advanced to meet	24.32691192626953
24185/28840	Having accomplished these three social duties Monte Cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say I have done my duty now let others do	94.2596664428711
24186/28840	Andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the	47.10375213623047
24187/28840	He found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weight	158.8518829345703
24188/28840	The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions	73.0181884765625
24189/28840	One of the notaries sat down the other remained	58.74278259277344
24190/28840	They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half Paris assembled was to	128.22891235351562
24191/28840	All took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the _style énergique_ commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea on	93.97496032714844
24192/28840	Danglars riveted attention Eugénies composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important	47.61970901489258
24193/28840	The contract was read during a profound	391.80364990234375
24194/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in spl	40.52363586425781
24195/28840	As for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without	76.73418426513672
24196/28840	Andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewild	109.13196563720703
24197/28840	The notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said   Gentlemen we are about to sign the	55.90647506713867
24198/28840	The baron was to sign first then the representative of	133.63702392578125
24199/28840	Cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal	139.0897216796875
24200/28840	The baron took the pen and signed then the	121.59814453125
24201/28840	The baroness approached leaning on Madame de Villeforts	41.639400482177734
24202/28840	My dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious An unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing	81.60326385498047
24203/28840	Danglars in the same tone in which he would have said Oh well what do I care   As a matter of fact said Monte Cristo approaching I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his	32.44007110595703
24204/28840	What you count said Madame Danglars signing if you are take care for I shall never forgive	26.65240478515625
24205/28840	But it is not my fault as I shall endeavor to	28.997343063354492
24206/28840	Everyone listened eagerly Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to	88.00545501708984
24207/28840	You remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave	50.57988739013672
24208/28840	In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they	46.764427185058594
24209/28840	Andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming	108.58501434326172
24210/28840	Well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the	120.29792022705078
24211/28840	The ladies screamed and two or three prepared to	219.82867431640625
24212/28840	No one could guess what the dirty rag could be I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered	106.58445739746094
24213/28840	My valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you bar	52.17350769042969
24214/28840	Yes indeed to you I succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied Monte Cristo amid the general outburst of amaz	57.403953552246094
24215/28840	But asked Madame Danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent	28.482276916503906
24216/28840	de Villefort   In this simple way madame replied Monte Cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence I therefore sent them to the kings	38.904273986816406
24217/28840	You understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against	73.662109375
24218/28840	Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawing	79.30522155761719
24219/28840	Possibly said Danglars was not this murdered man an old galleyslave   50025m       Yes replied the count a felon named Cader	21.06830596923828
24220/28840	Danglars turned slightly pale Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing	51.46090316772461
24221/28840	But go on signing said Monte Cristo I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and I beg to apologize to you baroness and to Mademoiselle Dangl	23.353498458862305

24223/28840	Prince Cavalcanti said the latter Prince Cavalcanti where are you   Andrea Andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian	46.76873016357422
24224/28840	Call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried Danglars to one of the floor	51.70064926147461
24225/28840	But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments _quærens quem devoret	104.9457778930664
24226/28840	There was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to	175.91476440429688

24230/28840	What is the matter sir asked Monte Cristo advancing to meet the	35.586936950683594
24231/28840	Which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti   A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the	24.411907196044922
24232/28840	But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti asked Danglars in amaz	36.72979736328125
24233/28840	A galleyslave escaped from confinement at Toul	29.340587615966797

24236/28840	Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the	59.24626159667969
24237/28840	Of all this household only two persons deserve our notice these are Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise dArm	18.631027221679688

24254/28840	I did not seek one I did not ask for	39.2362060546875
24255/28840	God sends me this and I hail it joyfully   How strong and courageous you are said the fair frail girl to her brunette	109.94207000732422
24256/28840	Did you not yet know me Come Louise let us talk of our	71.1745834350586
24257/28840	The postchaise   Was happily bought three days	85.08787536621094
24258/28840	Have you had it sent where we are to go for it  	70.23299407958984
24259/28840	Our passport   Here it	25.262744903564453
24260/28840	And Eugénie with her usual precision opened a printed paper and read  	53.983951568603516
24261/28840	Léon dArmilly twenty years of age profession artist hair black eyes black travelling with his	135.39222717285156

24264/28840	But consider the matter seriously Eugénie   Oh I am done with considering I am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of Spanish funds of Haitian	93.73619842529297
24265/28840	Instead of that Louisedo you understandair liberty melody of birds plains of Lombardy Venetian canals Roman palaces the Bay of	246.7403564453125
24266/28840	How much have we Louise   The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twentythree bank	82.44837188720703
24267/28840	And as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said Eugé	61.00706100463867
24268/28840	With fortyfive thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four but before six monthsyou with your music and I with my voicewe shall double our	120.74728393554688
24269/28840	Come you shall take charge of the money I of the jewelbox so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers	80.89073944091797
24270/28840	Now the portmanteaulet us make hastethe portmanteau   Stop said Louise going to listen at Madame Danglars	43.89901351928711
24271/28840	What do you fear   That we may be	33.66807556152344
24272/28840	They may tell us to open	216.32737731933594
24273/28840	They may if they like but we will	210.8743896484375
24274/28840	You are a perfect Amazon Eugénie And the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should	68.04054260253906
24275/28840	There now said Eugénie while I change my costume do you lock the portmante	57.94133758544922
24276/28840	Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmante	42.6837272644043
24277/28840	But I cannot said she I am not strong enough do you shut	79.64320373535156
24278/28840	When this was done Eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling	70.0770034790039
24279/28840	Here said she you see I have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be	75.20488739013672
24280/28840	But you   Oh I am never cold you know Besides with these mens clothes   Will you dress here  	62.375701904296875

24282/28840	Besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief I ought to be in that I shut myself uptell me   No trulyyou comfort	82.5536880493164
24283/28840	From the same drawer she took a mans complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every	109.89704895019531
24284/28840	Then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony	73.39207458496094
24285/28840	50039m       Oh the magnificent hair said Louise with	55.94994354248047
24286/28840	And am I not a hundred times better thus cried Eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so   Oh you are beautifulalways beautiful cried	75.62245178222656
24287/28840	Now where are you going   To Brussels if you like it is the nearest	31.646520614624023
24288/28840	We can go to Brussels Liège AixlaChapelle then up the Rhine to Stras	146.46617126464844
24289/28840	We will cross Switzerland and go down into Italy by the SaintGoth	91.7432861328125
24290/28840	What are you looking at   I am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that One would say you were carrying me	65.88878631591797
24291/28840	And they would be right _pardieu_   Oh I think you swore Eugé	34.38539123535156
24292/28840	And the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their	122.61006927490234
24293/28840	The yard was empty the clock was striking	744.5401000976562
24294/28840	The porter was not yet gone to	74.220703125
24295/28840	Eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his	54.68251419067383
24296/28840	She returned to Louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the	25.698408126831055
24297/28840	Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one	72.24327850341797
24298/28840	Then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard   Gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the	106.86796569824219
24299/28840	The porter got up as Eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it	91.27865600585938
24300/28840	Louise slid through the halfopen gate like a snake and bounded lightly	201.4146270751953
24301/28840	Eugénie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her	82.87687683105469
24302/28840	A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to	46.95981979370117
24303/28840	36 Rue de la Victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted	111.43387603759766
24304/28840	As for Eugénie she was as strong as a Judith or a Delil	106.56316375732422
24305/28840	Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him	48.654808044433594
24306/28840	The shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to	63.17582321166992
24307/28840	Mademoiselle said Eugénie let the porter get the postchaise from the coachhouse and fetch some posthorses from the	23.560901641845703
24308/28840	Here are five francs for his	209.1038818359375
24309/28840	Indeed said Louise I admire you and I could almost say respect	120.8638687133789
24310/28840	The laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no	105.55238342285156
24311/28840	In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a postboy and horses which were harnessed and put in the postchaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and	31.17751121520996
24312/28840	Here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman   To Fontainebleau replied Eugénie with an almost masculine	45.699913024902344
24313/28840	I am giving them the slip said Eugénie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our	90.8981704711914
24314/28840	And the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the	90.50226593017578
24315/28840	You are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her	44.9681282043457
24316/28840	A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the Barrière Saint	49.51390838623047
24317/28840	Ah said Louise breathing freely here we are out of	127.65007781982422
24318/28840	Yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied Eugé	64.93114471435547
24319/28840	I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied Eugé	116.80281066894531
24320/28840	These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of La Vil	72.9617691040039
24321/28840	The Bell and Bottle Tavern   And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their way to Brussels and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to	48.99650573730469
24322/28840	Notwithstanding his youth Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent	247.00662231445312
24323/28840	We have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last	59.250389099121094
24324/28840	But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the _trousseau_ of the brideelect was on	63.700286865234375
24325/28840	There were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls Valenciennes lace English veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the _corbeille	127.15023803710938
24326/28840	22 Now in passing through this room Andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before	58.177268981933594
24327/28840	Furnished with this plunder Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarm	43.7260627746582
24328/28840	Having passed through the Rue du MontBlanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the Rue La F	42.625953674316406
24329/28840	He was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the SaintLazare on the other Paris enshrouded in	60.287105560302734
24330/28840	Am I to be captured he cried no not if I can use more activity than my	221.87188720703125
24331/28840	My safety is now a mere question of	243.43179321289062
24332/28840	At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonni	24.184152603149414
24333/28840	The dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg SaintDenis where no doubt he ordinarily had his	56.86249923706055
24334/28840	What do you want sir asked the	42.310020446777344
24335/28840	Is your horse tired   Tired oh yes tired enoughhe has done nothing the whole of this blessed day Four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that I have earned and I ought to take ten to the	110.4168472290039
24336/28840	Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have   With pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be	86.92626953125
24337/28840	Tell me what I am to do for	81.84624481201172
24338/28840	A very easy thing if your horse isnt	221.79856872558594
24339/28840	I tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to	175.53770446777344
24340/28840	Ah I know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over	374.5457763671875
24341/28840	Exactly so I merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom I am going to hunt tomorrow at ChapelleenServ	39.67981719970703
24342/28840	He should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till halfpast eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone	75.93986511230469
24343/28840	Well will you try and overtake him   Nothing I should like	53.12012481689453
24344/28840	If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before Louvres	75.65188598632812
24345/28840	And if we do overtake him   Forty said Andrea after a moments hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely	45.2119026184082
24346/28840	Everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the	77.56629180908203
24347/28840	Once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two posth	110.29740142822266
24348/28840	Ah said Cavalcanti to himself if I only had that britzka those two good posthorses and above all the passport that carries them on And he sighed	66.4395751953125
24349/28840	The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle dArm	7.0443644523620605
24350/28840	Hurry hurry said Andrea we must overtake him	511.6375732421875
24351/28840	And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at Louv	121.2011489868164
24352/28840	Certainly said Andrea I shall not overtake my friend but I shall kill your horse therefore I had better	67.56224822998047
24353/28840	Here are thirty francs I will sleep at the _Cheval Rouge_ and will secure a place in the first	40.315040588378906
24354/28840	And Andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the	81.13971710205078
24355/28840	The cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to	132.50009155273438
24356/28840	Then he rested he must be near ChapelleenServal where he pretended to be	58.94938659667969
24357/28840	It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some	276.0077819824219
24358/28840	It would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was	108.28016662597656
24359/28840	It was still more impossible to remain in the department of the Oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in France this was quite out of the question especially to a man like Andrea perfectly conversant with criminal	103.19579315185547
24360/28840	He sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and	28.86040496826172
24361/28840	Ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was	59.13074493408203
24362/28840	He threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to ChapelleenServal he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the	61.351558685302734
24363/28840	My friend said Andrea I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw	84.06658172607422
24364/28840	I must reach Compiègne tonight or I shall cause deep anxiety to my	93.71983337402344
24365/28840	Could you let me hire a horse of you   An innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or	85.93423461914062
24366/28840	The host called the stableboy and ordered him to saddle _Le Blanc_ then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the	96.03987884521484
24367/28840	Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting	184.0904083251953
24368/28840	There is an excellent tavern at Compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been	42.02288055419922
24369/28840	My friend said Andrea I have been dining at SaintJeanauxBois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool I have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the	87.33304595947266
24370/28840	Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Borde	68.27503204345703
24371/28840	While the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose Andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have	130.1359100341797
24372/28840	3 which he had occupied on his last stay at Compièg	54.250545501708984
24373/28840	3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his	54.68556213378906
24374/28840	Andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that	181.29934692382812
24375/28840	7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as	144.4400634765625
24376/28840	3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at Chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be	92.59635162353516
24377/28840	The fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had	220.42886352539062
24378/28840	Then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with	72.55941009521484
24379/28840	Now here we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did	74.95170593261719
24380/28840	This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his	68.48919677734375
24381/28840	Moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misad	68.47821807861328
24382/28840	These were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused Andrea to sleep so sound	273.5682678222656
24383/28840	In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and longpointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from	58.86259078979492
24384/28840	About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his	88.87609100341797
24385/28840	In all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the	193.11634826660156
24386/28840	Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too	74.2589340209961
24387/28840	He jumped out of bed and ran to the	60.44453048706055
24388/28840	A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very	72.9802474975586
24389/28840	Why is that gendarme there asked Andrea of	120.8631820678711
24390/28840	Then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress	130.18829345703125
24391/28840	And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in	77.30464172363281
24392/28840	Now then said Andrea while dressing himself Ill wait till he leaves and then Ill slip	312.2021484375

24394/28840	The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the	82.94953918457031
24395/28840	Theyre after me was Andreas first	1143.842041015625
24396/28840	_Diable_   A pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with	24.418764114379883
24397/28840	His room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of	75.39349365234375
24398/28840	I am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in Andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or	222.39439392089844
24399/28840	He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and	46.88552474975586
24400/28840	With forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper   I have no money to pay my bill but I am not a dishonest man I leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the	72.96514129638672
24401/28840	I shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for I was	67.63777160644531
24402/28840	He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the	41.749305725097656
24403/28840	At this precise time the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the	36.749332427978516
24404/28840	Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following	313.3275451660156
24405/28840	At daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of Cader	54.272743225097656
24406/28840	Now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville which is next door to the Bell and Bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the	45.15861892700195
24407/28840	The sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before	53.49007034301758
24408/28840	The young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his	61.261898040771484
24409/28840	This late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than Andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his	76.6137466430664
24410/28840	Oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open I would rather find it triply	92.56884765625
24411/28840	And indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad	198.9228057861328
24412/28840	We say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single	100.18375396728516
24413/28840	He glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chim	106.48209381103516
24414/28840	Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious	88.0813217163086
24415/28840	The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to	111.19879150390625
24416/28840	The fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they	131.37351989746094
24417/28840	If once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another	76.6320571899414
24418/28840	He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by	89.36151123046875
24419/28840	At the same minute one of the little windows of the Hôtel de Ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme	22.579383850097656
24420/28840	For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head	70.84248352050781
24421/28840	The brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the	65.982421875
24422/28840	Well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the VillersCoterets and Noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no	84.70548248291016
24423/28840	The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the	86.67498779296875
24424/28840	Ah what is that cried the brig	52.484886169433594

24436/28840	The brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the	84.99687957763672
24437/28840	This is what had happened Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he	85.52266693115234
24438/28840	It would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was	194.1226806640625
24439/28840	Two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a	118.3993911743164

24451/28840	Andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious	73.61316680908203

24456/28840	The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galleysl	78.58134460449219
24457/28840	Andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked Have you any message for your father Mademoiselle Danglars for in all probability I shall return to Paris   Eugénie covered her face with her	26.94769859313965
24458/28840	Oh oh said Andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after	160.2454071044922
24459/28840	Was I not nearly your husband   50056m       And with this raillery Andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the	32.291500091552734

24461/28840	The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering	75.66790008544922
24462/28840	Eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the	57.72006607055664
24463/28840	The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre at	42.215274810791016
24464/28840	The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Concierger	411.9649963378906

24466/28840	We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser Lucien Debr	50.860652923583984
24467/28840	Tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the	67.5186767578125

24470/28840	The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of Eugé	60.05120849609375
24471/28840	She was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal	175.04888916015625
24472/28840	She listened at Eugénies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in	97.03861236572266
24473/28840	Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to	33.24209976196289
24474/28840	She called the maid and questioned	183.4881591796875
24475/28840	Mademoiselle Eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle dArmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no	33.790889739990234
24476/28840	Since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room Madame Danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent	66.87763977050781
24477/28840	In proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a	141.31259155273438
24478/28840	And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and	44.11281204223633
24479/28840	Eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are	120.6255111694336
24480/28840	The affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable	122.96083068847656
24481/28840	How fortunate that Eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble   And her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious Providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a	106.91242218017578
24482/28840	And then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on Cavalc	101.99815368652344
24483/28840	This Andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable	70.119384765625
24484/28840	de Villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been	69.56409454345703
24485/28840	And since Villefort the friend of Danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of Andreas intrig	38.65171813964844
24486/28840	Villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual	94.35382843017578
24487/28840	But the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could	50.61256408691406
24488/28840	She would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy	167.9503173828125

24490/28840	And after this reasoning she slept	510.420654296875

24492/28840	Three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be	73.384765625
24493/28840	He saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost	261.019287109375

24506/28840	Madame will await my return   Yes	178.7785186767578
24507/28840	The concierge closed the door leaving Madame Danglars in the	23.468076705932617
24508/28840	She had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again	74.0981674194336
24509/28840	Without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew	26.834768295288086
24510/28840	The valet de chambre appeared on the door	21.14699363708496
24511/28840	You will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and	58.43942642211914
24512/28840	de Villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act	32.95329284667969
24513/28840	In the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same	56.0515251159668
24514/28840	The baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates	42.27658462524414
24515/28840	Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of	57.06654739379883
24516/28840	But Villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her	62.438819885253906
24517/28840	Forgive my servants he said for a terror I cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become	175.35464477539062
24518/28840	Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so	58.04830551147461
24519/28840	You too then are unhappy she	346.6759948730469

24525/28840	Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly	49.6640739440918
24526/28840	Am I come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful	97.60491180419922

24545/28840	I was not thinking of that replied Madame Danglars	16.729393005371094

24571/28840	Villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the	55.79494094848633
24572/28840	Madame Danglars trembled with fear Villefort started with	33.116580963134766

24574/28840	Madame Danglars rose from her seat pale and	38.7039909362793
24575/28840	Adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the	60.05868148803711
24576/28840	Then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand   Come I had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson I only wanted a murder and here it	59.19650650024414
24577/28840	The Apparition   As the procureur had told Madame Danglars Valentine was not yet	33.36505889892578
24578/28840	But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of	60.15398025512695
24579/28840	Indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her	127.89397430419922
24580/28840	During the daytime Valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of	96.98060607910156
24581/28840	Noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness Villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and	78.57186889648438
24582/28840	At six oclock Villefort retired to his study at eight	57.11198425292969

24584/28840	A nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oclock when Valentine was	197.96612548828125
24585/28840	As she went downstairs she gave the keys of Valentines room to	84.38712310791016
24586/28840	de Villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little	35.93803405761719
24587/28840	Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less	112.16342163085938
24588/28840	Certainly though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover Monte Cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be	87.87224578857422
24589/28840	Now four days had elapsed and Valentine still	220.11387634277344
24590/28840	Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully	47.143470764160156
24591/28840	At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bellpull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present	130.45974731445312
24592/28840	Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of	77.55570983886719
24593/28840	From behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize Mor	93.13108825683594
24594/28840	The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound	121.93071746826172
24595/28840	At this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight	102.87826538085938
24596/28840	It is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other	105.61305236816406
24597/28840	Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his	67.51313781738281
24598/28840	This time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything Valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her	177.75404357910156
24599/28840	The pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew	203.26312255859375
24600/28840	Then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its	80.78904724121094
24601/28840	This did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghostfor he trod so softly that no sound was heardthen poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank	87.43063354492188
24602/28840	Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupef	32.6280403137207
24603/28840	Every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice Now you may	85.86469268798828
24604/28840	It was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an ex	42.075294494628906
24605/28840	The man placed his finger on her	70.14897918701172

24607/28840	It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to	53.9536247253418
24608/28840	Still the presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered	79.80028533935547

24610/28840	The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired	87.2357406616211
24611/28840	Maximilian she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated itMaximilianhas he then owned all to you  	59.28633499145508
24612/28840	He told me your life was his and I have promised him that you shall	71.48975372314453
24613/28840	You have promised him that I shall live  	28.602283477783203
24614/28840	But sir you spoke of vigilance and	308.9930725097656
24615/28840	Are you a doctor   Yes the best you could have at the present time believe	49.1407356262207
24616/28840	But you say you have watched said Valentine uneasily where have you beenI have not seen	58.26441192626953
24617/28840	The count extended his hand towards the	83.5289535522461
24618/28840	I was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which I have	105.69361114501953
24619/28840	Valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed   Sir I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an	63.130348205566406
24620/28840	But drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the	45.32929992675781
24621/28840	Drink this and then take nothing more	719.2533569335938
24622/28840	Valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in	80.37487030029297
24623/28840	Monte Cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to Valentine who smiled and swallowed the	90.75593566894531
24624/28840	Oh yes she exclaimed I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching	137.203125
24625/28840	Thank you sir thank you   This is how you have lived during the last four nights Valentine said the	44.34858703613281
24626/28840	Valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of	70.93639373779297
24627/28840	You saw the person repeated the young	80.03980255126953
24628/28840	What you tell me is horrible	114.59783172607422
24629/28840	You wish to make me believe something too	100.5954360961914

24631/28840	Your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the	162.0199432373047
24632/28840	He has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with	81.50068664550781
24633/28840	But even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too	138.88082885742188
24634/28840	But who then is this assassin this murderer   Let me also ask you a	118.52778625488281
24635/28840	Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life   50073m       No said Valentine who could desire my death   You shall know it now then said Monte Cristo	25.33325958251953
24636/28840	How do you mean said Valentine looking anxiously	50.39933395385742
24637/28840	Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers	257.7046203613281
24638/28840	Oh heavens exclaimed Valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her	143.8428497314453
24639/28840	Midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor	199.1219024658203
24640/28840	Valentine said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will	79.18898010253906
24641/28840	I think I hear a noise she said leave	125.77427673339844
24642/28840	Goodbye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with	57.4803466796875
24643/28840	Before closing the door he turned around once more and said Not a movementnot a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before I have the power of helping	97.23278045654297
24644/28840	And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after	56.8946647644043
24645/28840	Locusta   Valentine was alone two other clocks slower than that of SaintPhilippeduRoule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was	51.97941970825195
24646/28840	Then Valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the	54.39547348022461
24647/28840	She began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubtedthe inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her	105.7946548461914
24648/28840	Why should they To what end What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy   There was no fear of her falling	100.68791198730469
24649/28840	One terrible idea pressed upon her mindthat someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so	71.10873413085938
24650/28840	But through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted	77.87499237060547
24651/28840	Twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half	106.40687561035156
24652/28840	Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the	54.662208557128906
24653/28840	Someone approached the bed and drew back the	60.512962341308594
24654/28840	Valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil	188.80055236816406
24655/28840	The girl shuddered to the heart but did not	51.75070571899414
24656/28840	Still silent Valentine had promised not to	334.46044921875
24657/28840	Then everything was still excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just	112.03534698486328
24658/28840	Then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended	97.8093490600586
24659/28840	She saw a woman in a white dressinggown pouring a liquor from a phial into her	58.61474609375
24660/28840	During this short time Valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept it was Madame de Ville	78.5885009765625
24661/28840	On recognizing her stepmother Valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the	71.7514877319336
24662/28840	Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bedcurtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of	50.53630828857422
24663/28840	The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp	58.086429595947266
24664/28840	Then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the	184.97506713867188
24665/28840	Madame de Villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of Valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the	62.47473907470703
24666/28840	Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the	67.35407257080078
24667/28840	She only witnessed the withdrawal of the armthe fair round arm of a woman but twentyfive years old and who yet spread death around	124.08563995361328
24668/28840	50077m       It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the	26.942501068115234
24669/28840	The grating against the librarydoor aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insens	82.37909698486328
24670/28840	She raised her head with an	50.879669189453125
24671/28840	The noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the Count of Monte Cristo reapp	46.72830581665039

24685/28840	No and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over youhe should have occupied my placehe should have emptied that glasshe should have risen against the	86.51263427734375
24686/28840	Spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his	86.42991638183594

24688/28840	I will watch over them as I have over	40.566585540771484
24689/28840	Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a	44.52802276611328
24690/28840	Then he drew from his waistcoatpocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her	64.30741119384766
24691/28840	She took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her vener	40.368019104003906
24692/28840	She evidently interrogated him by her	209.65847778320312
24693/28840	Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed	137.98809814453125
24694/28840	And now my dear child adieu for the	68.75269317626953
24695/28840	I will try and gain a little sleep for you are	62.76008987426758
24696/28840	Go said Valentine whatever happens I promise you not to	73.352783203125
24697/28840	Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given	39.22336959838867
24698/28840	Valentine   The nightlight continued to burn on the chimneypiece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the	38.47801208496094
24699/28840	The globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final ag	83.7532958984375
24700/28840	A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young	79.12054443359375
24701/28840	All noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was fright	69.85761260986328
24702/28840	It was then that the door of Edwards room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was Madame de Villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had	58.40162658691406
24703/28840	She stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if Valentines glass were	60.46689987182617
24704/28840	It was still about a quarter full as we before	269.8437805175781
24705/28840	Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the	70.09027099609375
24706/28840	If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on	42.759559631347656
24707/28840	The dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own	105.28436279296875
24708/28840	At length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on	113.33602905273438
24709/28840	The young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the halfclosed teeth the white lips no longer quiveredthe eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as	86.29920959472656
24710/28840	Madame de Villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls	62.399051666259766
24711/28840	She only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a	74.69841766357422
24712/28840	Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to	59.35903549194336
24713/28840	The minutes passed Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of	75.58131408691406
24714/28840	She was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is	118.06563568115234
24715/28840	Just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled Madame de Villefort who shuddered and dropped the	37.98798751831055
24716/28840	Immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast	171.609619140625
24717/28840	Overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of	84.17139434814453
24718/28840	The darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the Venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the	79.05184173583984
24719/28840	About this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her	56.73885726928711
24720/28840	To the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentines condition but to this hireling Valentine only appeared to	84.32324981689453
24721/28840	Good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters	190.6693572998047
24722/28840	Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more	60.0508918762207
24723/28840	Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards Valentine and for the first time noticed the white	90.9478530883789
24724/28840	She tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sickn	61.14860534667969
24725/28840	She screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed   Help help   50083m       What is the matter asked	19.546924591064453
24726/28840	dAvrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited	56.42356872558594
24727/28840	What is it asked Villefort rushing from his	36.46061706542969
24728/28840	Doctor do you hear them call for help   Yes yes let us hasten up it was in Valentines	38.96426010131836
24729/28840	But before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by light	45.290130615234375
24730/28840	Call Madame de VillefortWake Madame de Villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to	28.20079803466797
24731/28840	But instead of obeying him the servants stood watching	117.0109634399414
24732/28840	dAvrigny who ran to Valentine and raised her in his	25.15139389038086
24733/28840	Oh where will be the end   Villefort rushed into the	21.61277198791504
24734/28840	What are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hands to	66.32189178466797
24735/28840	I say that Valentine is dead replied dAvrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calm	37.413753509521484
24736/28840	50085m      	10.432875633239746
24737/28840	de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the	33.85491943359375
24738/28840	Just then Madame de Villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious	33.43305587768555
24739/28840	On a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the	90.97261810302734
24740/28840	She saw dAvrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the	52.48259735107422
24741/28840	It was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the	88.07737731933594
24742/28840	The spectre of Valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her	182.23829650878906
24743/28840	It was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which Valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive	62.73863983154297
24744/28840	dAvrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the	108.7636947631836
24745/28840	Ah exclaimed dAvrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a	27.95003318786621
24746/28840	Madame de Villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and	53.73164749145508
24747/28840	Directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and Villefort was still absorbed in	55.793609619140625
24748/28840	dAvrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried	30.842182159423828
24749/28840	He lifted up the drapery over the entrance to Edwards room and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the	49.9640007019043
24750/28840	Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort he said to the	24.76350212097168
24751/28840	50087m       But Mademoiselle de Villefort stammered the	8.781784057617188
24752/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help said dAvrigny since she is	13.908370971679688
24753/28840	Deaddead groaned forth Villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that	48.5356330871582
24754/28840	Who said Valentine was dead   The two men turned round and saw Morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstr	34.74446105957031
24755/28840	At the usual time Morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtiers	30.620718002319336
24756/28840	Contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he	255.32546997070312
24757/28840	He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to	42.28331756591797
24758/28840	Noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the	116.8407974243164
24759/28840	Morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his	52.88594055175781
24760/28840	Every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by Noirt	67.80841064453125
24761/28840	Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no	152.10069274902344
24762/28840	Noirtiers room was opened like all the	42.78485107421875
24763/28840	The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his	53.070247650146484
24764/28840	How are you sir asked Morrel with a sickness of	50.04787826538086
24765/28840	Well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneas	61.72910690307617
24766/28840	You are thoughtful sir continued Morrel you want something shall I call one of the servants   Yes replied Noirt	43.52643966674805
24767/28840	Morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one	230.31993103027344
24768/28840	He turned towards Noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily	64.21603393554688
24769/28840	Oh exclaimed Morrel why do they not come Is anyone ill in the house The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from their	60.61906814575195
24770/28840	What is the matter You alarm	57.26234436035156
24771/28840	Valentine Valentine   Yes yes signed Noirt	21.794527053833008
24772/28840	Maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wains	41.36458206176758
24773/28840	Yes yes yes continued the old	23.797771453857422
24774/28840	50089m       Maximilian rushed up the little staircase while Noirtiers eyes seemed to sayQuicker quicker   In a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached Valent	24.69108772277832
24775/28840	There was no occasion to push the door it was wide	62.472801208496094
24776/28840	A sob was the only sound he	265.2178649902344
24777/28840	He saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white draper	81.96845245361328
24778/28840	Maximilian   Villefort rose halfashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of	24.508777618408203
24779/28840	The terrible office he had held for twentyfive years had succeeded in making him more or less than	92.07772827148438
24780/28840	His glance at first wandering fixed itself upon Mor	193.8513641357422
24781/28840	Godo you hear said Villefort while dAvrigny advanced to lead Morrel	45.776309967041016
24782/28840	Morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing Noirtier	138.61691284179688
24783/28840	When he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into Valentines	54.604736328125
24784/28840	This could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful	130.75369262695312
24785/28840	But the most fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other	82.97224426269531
24786/28840	That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful appar	48.17988586425781
24787/28840	Each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had	88.53888702392578
24788/28840	See what they have done cried Morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards	36.60517120361328
24789/28840	See my father see   Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called Noirtier his	31.38327980041504
24790/28840	And the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its	298.2566223144531
24791/28840	DAvrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful rest	128.47561645507812
24792/28840	Sir cried Morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who I am and what right I have to be	51.679351806640625
24793/28840	Oh you know it tell them tell them And the young mans voice was choked by so	128.72561645507812
24794/28840	As for the old man his chest heaved with his panting resp	42.18379592895508
24795/28840	One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding	105.42487335205078
24796/28840	At length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of Noirt	57.843257904052734
24797/28840	Tell them said Morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that I am her betrot	24.769033432006836
24798/28840	Tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the	220.14378356933594
24799/28840	Tell themoh tell them that corpse belongs to me   The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive	57.33001708984375
24800/28840	But Morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of Valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the	82.09913635253906
24801/28840	For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and	98.35064697265625
24802/28840	At length Villefort the most composed of all spoke   Sir said he to Maximilian you say you loved Valentine that you were betrothed to	41.898468017578125
24803/28840	I knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet I her father forgive you for I see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my	97.50146484375
24804/28840	But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of	76.41753387451172
24805/28840	Take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her	319.4989929199219
24806/28840	Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the	126.0833511352539

24808/28840	What do you mean sir asked Villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of Mor	29.247140884399414
24809/28840	I tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his	101.38243865966797
24810/28840	The eyes of Noirtier glistened and dAvrigny	16.442611694335938
24811/28840	Now sir continued Morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like	114.52283477783203
24812/28840	le Procureur du Roi said Morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed I denounce the crime it is your place to seek the	66.34384155273438
24813/28840	The young mans implacable eyes interrogated Villefort who on his side glanced from Noirtier to dAvrign	25.29026222229004
24814/28840	But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of Maximil	32.03004455566406
24815/28840	Sir said Villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotionsir you are deceived no one commits crimes	102.30868530273438
24816/28840	It is horrible indeed but no one assass	91.47062683105469
24817/28840	The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage and dAvrigny prepared to	20.26822280883789
24818/28840	Morrel however extended his arm and commanded	238.3477020263672
24819/28840	And I say that murders _are_ committed here said Morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four	115.50808715820312
24820/28840	I tell you Valentines life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of	129.5812225341797
24821/28840	I tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has	84.80923461914062
24822/28840	I tell you that you know these things as well as I do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a	30.10799217224121
24823/28840	Oh you rave sir exclaimed Villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was	41.28276824951172
24824/28840	50095m       I rave said Morrel well then I appeal to	34.421043395996094
24825/28840	Ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of Madame de SaintMérans	27.376995086669922
24826/28840	You thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of	158.4915008544922
24827/28840	Yes yes continued Morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my	161.46563720703125
24828/28840	Certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by	146.56936645507812
24829/28840	de Villefort towards his own relations I ought to have denounced him to the authorities then I should not have been an accomplice to thy death as I now am sweet beloved Valentine but the accomplice shall become the aven	65.8017807006836

24831/28840	And I too he exclaimed in a low voice I unite with	84.13230895996094
24832/28840	Morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly	103.52226257324219
24833/28840	Morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre   Stay he said	36.631507873535156
24834/28840	Yes indicated Noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his	65.3353042602539
24835/28840	Do you know the assassin asked Mor	49.92927932739258
24836/28840	And will you direct us exclaimed the young	90.02227783203125
24837/28840	dAvrigny listen   Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy and thus fixed his	28.012462615966797
24838/28840	Then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the	54.03333282470703
24839/28840	Do you wish me to leave said Morrel	48.152244567871094
24840/28840	Alas alas sir have pity on me   The old mans eyes remained fixed on the	47.45498275756836
24841/28840	May I at least return asked Mor	130.8120574951172
24842/28840	Must I leave alone  	99.93737030029297
24843/28840	Whom am I to take with me The procureur  	75.38562774658203
24844/28840	You wish to remain alone with	54.95344543457031
24845/28840	But can he understand you  	45.96013259887695
24846/28840	Oh said Villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him aloneoh be satisfied I can understand my	65.85752868652344
24847/28840	While uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together	69.32848358154297
24848/28840	DAvrigny took the young mans arm and led him out of the	80.82276153564453
24849/28840	A more than deathlike silence then reigned in the	81.70687866210938
24850/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where dAvrigny and Morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in	24.25389862060547
24851/28840	You can come he said and led them back to Noirt	42.17908477783203
24852/28840	His face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to	70.45893859863281
24853/28840	Gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves The two men drew	110.4847412109375
24854/28840	But said Morrel the culpritthe murdererthe	160.28048706054688

24856/28840	My father has revealed the culprits name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this	79.94100952148438
24857/28840	Do you not father   Yes resolutely replied Noirt	32.509986877441406
24858/28840	Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape	69.50166320800781
24859/28840	Oh sir said Villefort arresting Maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that Valentine will be terribly reven	47.65810775756836
24860/28840	Is it not so father   The old man made a sign in the	34.87957000732422
24861/28840	Villefort continued   He knows me and I have pledged my word to	31.0802059173584
24862/28840	Noirtier asked Morrel while dAvrigny looked inquiring	11.889866828918457
24863/28840	Yes replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister	18.355823516845703
24864/28840	Swear then said Villefort joining the hands of Morrel and dAvrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my	27.032711029052734
24865/28840	DAvrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble Yes but Morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and	78.56095886230469
24866/28840	We have before stated that all the servants had	95.35594940185547
24867/28840	de Villefort was therefore obliged to request	51.94740676879883
24868/28840	dAvrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious	78.07971954345703
24869/28840	It was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of Noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his	107.4303970336914
24870/28840	Villefort retired to his study and dAvrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the	55.25640869140625
24871/28840	Noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grand	33.18125915527344
24872/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour	21.127979278564453
24873/28840	dAvrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house Villefort himself was obliged to open to	66.48809814453125
24874/28840	But he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death	104.61073303222656
24875/28840	The two doctors therefore entered the room	282.0702209472656
24876/28840	Noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the	64.59241485595703
24877/28840	The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the	117.49470520019531
24878/28840	Alas said dAvrigny she is indeed dead poor child   50099m       Yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had	24.744272232055664
24879/28840	Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old mans eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his	45.70752716064453
24880/28840	He therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping	74.27200317382812
24881/28840	A tear which appeared in the old mans eye expressed his thanks to the	82.86600494384766
24882/28840	The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by dAvrign	66.52205657958984
24883/28840	Villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to dAvrigny and said   And now the	32.458492279052734
24884/28840	Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine asked dAvrign	65.41230010986328
24885/28840	The nearest said the district doctor is a good Italian abbé who lives next door to	151.10923767089844
24886/28840	Shall I call on him as I pass   DAvrigny said Villefort be so kind I beseech you as to accompany this	29.929140090942383
24887/28840	Here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my childs	70.17735290527344

24889/28840	You will excuse me will you not A priest can understand a fathers	179.5055389404297
24890/28840	de Villefort giving the key to dAvrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to	51.4771842956543
24891/28840	For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflict	685.0585327148438
24892/28840	As the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next	60.801239013671875
24893/28840	This is the abbé of whom I spoke said the doctor to dAvrign	21.115238189697266
24894/28840	Sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter I mean	170.04751586914062
24895/28840	Ah said the priest in a marked Italian accent yes I have heard that death is in that	85.4673080444336
24896/28840	Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of	173.51156616210938
24897/28840	I was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our	278.34130859375
24898/28840	I know it sir the servants who fled from the house informed	139.26803588867188
24899/28840	I also know that her name is Valentine and I have already prayed for	91.02165222167969
24900/28840	Thank you sir said dAvrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue	83.7740707397461
24901/28840	Come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to	125.1585464477539
24902/28840	I am going sir and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than	76.39159393310547
24903/28840	DAvrigny took the priests hand and without meeting Villefort who was engaged in his study they reached Valentines room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undert	134.78941345214844
24904/28840	On entering the room Noirtiers eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the	60.534637451171875
24905/28840	DAvrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirt	93.29656219482422
24906/28840	In order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as dAvrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to Madame de Villeforts	82.03485107421875
24907/28840	Danglars Signature   The next morning dawned dull and	182.1442108154297
24908/28840	During the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the windingsheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in	299.1810302734375
24909/28840	This windingsheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight	126.96854400634766
24910/28840	During the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried Noirtier from Valentines room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his	112.11000061035156
24911/28840	The Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling	167.64291381835938

24913/28840	They found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling	240.29637145996094
24914/28840	They both stood in amazement at the	82.7000961303711
24915/28840	See said dAvrigny to Villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest	59.8680534362793
24916/28840	Noirtier did not love his child and yet he	83.77581787109375
24917/28840	Yes you are right replied Villefort surprised he sleeps indeed And this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all	424.88372802734375
24918/28840	Grief has stunned him replied dAvrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs	149.98756408691406
24919/28840	See I have not slept said Villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun	354.6244812011719
24920/28840	I have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what I have written during these two days and	145.5071258544922
24921/28840	I have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin Benedet	166.0148468017578
24922/28840	Oh work workmy passion my joy my delightit is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of dAvrign	137.2132110595703
24923/28840	Do you require my services now asked dAvrign	38.477806091308594

24926/28840	I shall work doctorwhen I work I forget	1763.6907958984375
24927/28840	And indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in	149.57054138183594
24928/28840	On the doorsteps dAvrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to	203.70411682128906
24929/28840	He was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be	304.0156555175781
24930/28840	Gradually the receptionroom filled and some of our old friends made their appearancewe mean Debray ChâteauRenaud and Beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for	140.4395294189453
24931/28840	de Villefort moved in the first Parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal	143.49655151367188
24932/28840	Those who were acquainted soon formed into little	2156.8076171875
24933/28840	One of them was made of Debray ChâteauRenaud and Beauch	17.567522048950195
24934/28840	Did you know her   I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerfs among the rest she appeared to me charming though rather	129.4302978515625

24937/28840	I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said Beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to	49.077415466308594
24938/28840	Have you mentioned this death in your paper   It has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed I doubt if it will please	118.81768798828125
24939/28840	Villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kings attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about	154.1324462890625
24940/28840	dAvrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about	296.80255126953125
24941/28840	But whom are you seeking Debray   I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo said the young	22.664714813232422
24942/28840	I met him on the boulevard on my way here said Beauch	45.8484992980957
24943/28840	I think he is about to leave Paris he was going to his	44.589481353759766
24944/28840	His banker Danglars is his banker is he not asked ChâteauRenaud of Debr	27.798603057861328
24945/28840	I believe so replied the secretary with slight uneas	49.90338134765625
24946/28840	But Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here I do not see Mor	42.151039123535156
24947/28840	Morrel Do they know him asked ChâteauRen	24.989511489868164
24948/28840	I think he has only been introduced to Madame de Ville	17.054733276367188
24949/28840	Still he ought to have been here said Debray I wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the	101.60423278808594
24950/28840	But hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to	214.1356201171875
24951/28840	Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chaussée dAntin to	34.43011474609375
24952/28840	The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable	110.66643524169922
24953/28840	Well said he extending his hand to Monte Cristo I suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my	39.87602615356445
24954/28840	When I perceived you I was just asking myself whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them	301.1207580566406
24955/28840	Well on my word of honor I answered No I wished no ill to Morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our	125.55928039550781
24956/28840	Do you know count that persons of our time of lifenot that you belong to the class you are still a young manbut as I was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this	181.78091430664062
24957/28840	Alas do you not know   What new calamity   My daughter   Mademoiselle Danglars   Eugénie has left us   Good heavens what are you telling me   The truth my dear	19.23188591003418
24958/28840	Oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children   Do you think so   Indeed I	44.40187454223633
24959/28840	And so Mademoiselle Danglars   She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to	50.47416305541992
24960/28840	And is she gone   The other night she	128.85533142089844
24961/28840	With Madame Danglars   No with a	22.358089447021484
24962/28840	But still we have quite lost our dear Eugénie for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to	120.12023162841797
24963/28840	Still baron said Monte Cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a	193.89871215820312
24964/28840	Danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke	70.78829193115234
24965/28840	Yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation I ought to be consoled I am	145.95179748535156
24966/28840	So rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare   Danglars smiled at the goodnatured pleasantry of the	97.58206939697266
24967/28840	That reminds me he said that when you entered I was on the point of signing five little bonds I have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others   Pray do	96.54306030273438
24968/28840	There was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the	51.05985641479492
24969/28840	Are they Spanish Haitian or Neapolitan bonds said Monte Crist	177.77769470214844

24976/28840	You do not doubt it   No   You say so with an accentstay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the Treasury for the same	107.24506378173828
24977/28840	No said Monte Cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious I will make the experiment	289.5054931640625
24978/28840	I am credited on you for six	339.4132995605469
24979/28840	I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand franc	51.856197357177734
24980/28840	I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between	334.4623718261719
24981/28840	I had prepared it beforehand for I am much in want of money	135.16561889648438
24982/28840	And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to Dangl	44.570335388183594
24983/28840	If a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater	143.19654846191406
24984/28840	What he stammered do you mean to keep that money Excuse me excuse me but I owe this money to the charity funda deposit which I promised to pay this	186.7563018798828
24985/28840	But here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards Danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its	321.53460693359375
24986/28840	Suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed count	177.13629150390625
24987/28840	50109m       Certainly he said your receipt is	61.89082336425781
24988/28840	Oh dear yes and if you were at Rome the house of Thomson  French would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just	86.85458374023438
24989/28840	Then I may keep this money   Yes said Danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his	52.424171447753906
24990/28840	Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say Come reflect if you repent there is still	100.29440307617188
24991/28840	No said Danglars no decidedly no keep my	183.0561065673828
24992/28840	But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business I intended this money for the charity fund and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise	1280.5762939453125
24993/28840	How absurdas if one crown were not as good as	598.8744506835938
24994/28840	Excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but	1026.5745849609375
24995/28840	Certainly I excuse you said Monte Cristo graciously and pocket	103.9666976928711
24996/28840	And he placed the bonds in his pocket	135.20468139648438
24997/28840	But said Danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs   Oh a mere nothing said Monte Crist	22.09678840637207
24998/28840	The balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be qu	181.1262664794922
24999/28840	Count said Danglars are you speaking seriously   I never joke with bankers said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced  	44.63334274291992
25000/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo I think I arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with	94.29590606689453
25001/28840	Danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count	37.833534240722656
25002/28840	Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with	239.236083984375
25003/28840	de Boville who was standing in the waitingroom and who was introduced into Danglars room as soon as the count had	34.71649932861328
25004/28840	The counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receivergeneral held in his	312.593505859375
25005/28840	At the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the	103.09600067138672
25006/28840	Meanwhile Danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver	757.8236083984375
25007/28840	We need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his	116.86559295654297
25008/28840	Goodmorning creditor said he for I wager anything it is the creditor who visits	1262.5269775390625
25009/28840	de Boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from	782.2349853515625
25010/28840	And yet they say orphans are to be pitied said Danglars wishing to prolong the j	104.91316223144531
25011/28840	Poor things   Here I am in their name said	80.57453155517578
25012/28840	de Boville but did you receive my letter yesterday  	65.5625991821289
25013/28840	50111m       My dear	14.008272171020508
25014/28840	de Boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twentyfour hours since	412.73931884765625
25015/28840	de Monte Cristo whom you just saw leaving hereyou did see him I think   Yes well   Well	129.50474548339844
25016/28840	de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five	76.30938720703125
25017/28840	How so   The count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by Thomson  French of Rome he came to demand five millions at once which I paid him with checks on the	214.81121826171875
25018/28840	My funds are deposited there and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the	165.57814025878906
25019/28840	Two days will be a different thing said Danglars	39.02922439575195
25020/28840	Come said Boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me   Perhaps he knows you though you do not know him	100.93614959716797
25021/28840	Five millions   Here is his	244.78028869628906
25022/28840	de Boville took the paper Danglars presented him and read   Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson  French of	71.96005249023438
25023/28840	Do you know the house of Thomson  French   Yes I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200000 francs but since then I have not heard it	45.71551513671875
25024/28840	It is one of the best houses in Europe said Danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his	67.87395477294922
25025/28840	de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary	859.6026000976562
25026/28840	I must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from	426.1276550292969
25027/28840	Oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to 20000 francs a	299.696044921875
25028/28840	It is magnificent I will set before him the example of Madame de Morcerf and her	49.53323745727539
25029/28840	What example   They gave all their fortune to the	619.8042602539062
25030/28840	For what reason   Because they would not spend money so guiltily	677.4171142578125
25031/28840	And what are they to live upon   The mother retires into the country and the son enters the	238.12596130371094
25032/28840	50113m       Well I must confess these are scru	26.13189125061035
25033/28840	I registered their deed of gift	31295.890625
25034/28840	And how much did they possess   Oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen hundred thousand franc	183.87440490722656
25035/28840	Certainly said Danglars in the most natural tone in the	15.3120756149292
25036/28840	Are you then pressed for this money   Yes for the examination of our cash takes place	205.857421875
25037/28840	Tomorrow Why did you not tell me so before Why it is as good as a century At what hour does the examination take place   At two o	77.97833251953125
25038/28840	de Boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the	128.93560791015625
25039/28840	Now I think of it you can do better said Dangl	26.848526000976562
25040/28840	How do you mean   The receipt of	58.97575759887695
25041/28840	de Monte Cristo is as good as money take it to Rothschilds or Lafittes and they will take it off your hands at	214.9740447998047
25042/28840	What though payable at Rome   Certainly it will only cost you a discount of 5000 or 6000 franc	272.4387512207031
25043/28840	_Ma foi_ he said I prefer waiting till	102.8073959350586
25044/28840	What a proposition   I thought perhaps said Danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up   Indeed said the	117.32372283935547
25045/28840	And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some	74.60665130615234
25046/28840	Ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be	725.9768676757812
25047/28840	Better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing	88.67041015625
25048/28840	How were you to blame in that affair   Listenwhen one bears an irreproachable name as I do one is rather	438.7952880859375
25049/28840	Everybody pities you sir and above all Mademoiselle Danglars   Poor Eugénie said Danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life  	33.15841293334961
25050/28840	Alas it is unhappily but too	193.88058471679688
25051/28840	The day after the event she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or	273.90167236328125
25052/28840	de Boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the	821.48681640625
25053/28840	Then he doublelocked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in banknotes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed   To Madame la Baronne Dangl	237.42889404296875
25054/28840	I will place it on her table myself tonight he murm	185.5873260498047
25055/28840	Then taking a passport from his drawer he saidGood it is available for two months	994.8857421875
25056/28840	The Cemetery of PèreLachaise  	32.629478454589844
25057/28840	de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on	215.03872680664062
25058/28840	The weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulev	212.63299560546875
25059/28840	de Villefort a true Parisian considered the cemetery of PèreLachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy	332.7227783203125
25060/28840	He had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his	324.6082458496094
25061/28840	On the front of the monument was inscribed The families of SaintMéran and Villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée Valentines	111.88319396972656
25062/28840	The pompous procession therefore wended its way towards PèreLachaise from the Faubourg SaintHonor	42.60246276855469
25063/28840	Having crossed Paris it passed through the Faubourg du Temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the	246.34616088867188
25064/28840	More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourningcoaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on	255.64686584472656
25065/28840	As they left Paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained Monte Crist	129.0765380859375
25066/28840	The count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on	109.13420104980469
25067/28840	ChâteauRenaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_ joined him Beauchamp did the	35.6430778503418
25068/28840	The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in	269.1719055175781
25069/28840	50119m       Where is Morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is   We have already asked that question said ChâteauRenaud for none of us has seen	34.33393859863281
25070/28840	The count was silent but continued to gaze around	249.38340759277344
25071/28840	At length they arrived at the	73.68561553955078
25072/28840	The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yewtrees Monte Cristo recognized him whom he	383.8843078613281
25073/28840	One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent met	2326.62158203125
25074/28840	Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else	122.68550872802734
25075/28840	Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his	206.13333129882812
25076/28840	Everything was conducted in the usual	202.27999877929688
25077/28840	Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw Morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his	59.88227081298828
25078/28840	See said Beauchamp pointing out Morrel to Debr	24.044076919555664
25079/28840	What is he doing up there And they called ChâteauRenauds attention to	65.73335266113281
25080/28840	How pale he is said ChâteauRenaud shudder	27.506105422973633
25081/28840	Not at all said ChâteauRenaud slowly I think he is violently	61.65200424194336
25082/28840	Bah said Debray he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort you said so	26.729995727539062
25083/28840	Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de Morcer	141.62168884277344
25084/28840	The discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremon	315.6094665527344
25085/28840	And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he	452.05755615234375
25086/28840	The funeral being over the guests returned to	216.06820678710938
25087/28840	ChâteauRenaud looked for a moment for Morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count Morrel had quitted his post and ChâteauRenaud failing in his search joined Debray and Beauch	32.08086013793945
25088/28840	Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of Morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and work	172.18165588378906
25089/28840	Morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unper	112.17631530761719
25090/28840	The count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon Morrel upon the first	370.1549987792969
25091/28840	Monte Cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for Morrel turning round said calmly   You see I was	127.30457305908203
25092/28840	The scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to	135.70150756835938
25093/28840	Shall I drive you back to Paris he	224.1895294189453
25094/28840	Do you wish anything   Leave me to	104.17900085449219
25095/28840	The count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards Paris without once looking	181.47113037109375
25096/28840	He walked slowly down the Rue de la Roqu	248.59835815429688
25097/28840	The count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces	398.75286865234375
25098/28840	Maximilian crossed the canal and entered the Rue Meslay by the boulev	74.77054595947266
25099/28840	Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrels entrance it was again opened for the	76.47209930419922

25101/28840	Ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Mes	96.41297149658203
25102/28840	Maximilian has just returned has he not madame asked the	68.62806701660156
25103/28840	50123m       Yes I think I saw him pass but pray call	38.40321350097656
25104/28840	Excuse me madame but I must go up to Maximilians room this instant replied Monte Cristo I have something of the greatest importance to tell	51.20539474487305
25105/28840	Go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had	53.863460540771484
25106/28840	Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to Maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was	112.92400360107422
25107/28840	Like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked Maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the	170.9036407470703
25108/28840	The counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable	134.87884521484375
25109/28840	What shall I do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall I ring No the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder	379.40594482421875
25110/28840	I beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my	161.34535217285156
25111/28840	Since it is opened I will take advantage of it to enter your room do not disturb yourselfdo not disturb yourself   And passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the	92.61644744873047
25112/28840	Morrel evidently discomposed came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his	137.3760223388672
25113/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo rubbing his elbow its all your servants fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on	306.23968505859375

25118/28840	Monte Cristo advanced into the room Maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed	65.97002410888672
25119/28840	You were writing said Monte Cristo with a searching	37.78474044799805
25120/28840	I have already had the honor of telling you I was said Mor	37.755043029785156

25122/28840	I am on the point of starting on a journey replied Morrel disdain	48.85340118408203
25123/28840	My friend exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite	43.53076934814453
25124/28840	Sir   My friend my dear Maximilian do not make a hasty resolution I entreat	20.931745529174805

25126/28840	You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose upon you with my frivolous solicit	396.505859375
25127/28840	Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but Monte Cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron	131.7130584716797
25128/28840	You wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written	65.79469299316406
25129/28840	It is a mercy to let me die for if I live I shall lose my reason and become	101.9050521850586
25130/28840	Morrel   Yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and I will do so be satisfied When you spoke to me at the cemetery I answered youmy heart was softened when you arrived here I allowed you to	113.03224182128906
25131/28840	And I again repeat you shall not commit	808.1621704101562
25132/28840	Prevent me then replied Morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron	357.9722595214844
25133/28840	50127m       And who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings   Who am I repeated Monte Crist	182.64926147460938
25134/28840	Morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Crist	129.12005615234375
25135/28840	Julie Emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of Maximil	126.676025390625
25136/28840	Julie threw herself into the arms of the count Emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel Morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his	81.82825469970703
25137/28840	Then the ironhearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and we	191.25604248046875
25138/28840	For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to	300.3043212890625
25139/28840	Listen my friends said the countI may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven yearsthe discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never	104.01177978515625
25140/28840	I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now I am	121.84532928466797
25141/28840	Then turning around and seeing that Morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing Emmanuels hand significantly Watch over	153.3574676513672
25142/28840	Why so asked the young man	87.30236053466797
25143/28840	I cannot explain myself but watch over	140.5134735107422
25144/28840	Emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to	58.06671142578125
25145/28840	Then walking towards Morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stup	99.52131652832031
25146/28840	Julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the	818.4542846679688
25147/28840	While announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on Morrel and remarked that the words I shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his letharg	77.999755859375
25148/28840	He then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of Emmanuel and Julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father   My kind friends leave me alone with Maximil	94.75605773925781
25149/28840	Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which Monte Cristo had	377.97833251953125
25150/28840	She drew her husband to the	109.42887878417969
25151/28840	The count was alone with Morrel who remained motionless as a	48.32712936401367
25152/28840	Come said MonteCristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again Maximilian   Yes for I begin to suffer	183.2111053466797
25153/28840	The count frowned apparently in gloomy	5475.13427734375
25154/28840	Maximilian Maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a	72.8838119506836
25155/28840	Oh do not fear my friend said Morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count I shall no longer attempt my	38.581085205078125
25156/28840	Then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair   No I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a	206.633056640625
25157/28840	Poor fellow what is it   My grief will kill me of	123.1893539428711
25158/28840	My friend said Monte Cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to	35.13557434082031
25159/28840	One day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution I also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself	183.2945556640625
25160/28840	Look at me said Monte Cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasivelook at	120.38807678222656

25162/28840	Well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond Now if I entreat if I order you to live Morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your	125.91079711914062
25163/28840	Oh heavens said the young man oh heavenswhat are you saying count Take	145.35386657714844
25164/28840	But perhaps you have never loved   Child replied the	184.60394287109375
25165/28840	You see I have been a soldier ever since I attained man	489.0833740234375
25166/28840	I reached the age of twentynine without loving for none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of	1141.4256591796875
25167/28840	Well at twentynine I saw Valentine for two years I have loved her for two years I have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and	219.14170837402344
25168/28840	Count to possess Valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without Valentine the earth is	829.4638061523438
25169/28840	I have told you to hope said the	26.32425308227539
25170/28840	Then have a care I repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed I should lose my reason for I should hope that I could again behold	124.71257781982422
25171/28840	My friend my father said Morrel with excitement have a care I again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms	591.6194458007812
25172/28840	Weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural	799.70751953125
25173/28840	I must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the	176.7822265625
25174/28840	Ah said Morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despairah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy	395.69482421875
25175/28840	No my friend I was wrong to caution you do not fear I will bury my grief so deep in my heart I will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with	102.61076354980469
25176/28840	Adieu my friend adieu   On the contrary said the count after this time you must live with meyou must not leave me and in a week we shall have left France behind	46.458255767822266
25177/28840	And you still bid me hope   I tell you to hope because I have a method of curing	210.65347290039062
25178/28840	Count you render me sadder than before if it be	176.54029846191406

25180/28840	And Morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredul	110.67182159423828
25181/28840	What can I say more asked Monte Crist	29.866374969482422
25182/28840	I have confidence in the remedy I propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its	194.69398498535156
25183/28840	Or take care Morrel lest I call you ungr	124.02330017089844
25184/28840	Will you promise me   Yes for I am a man and have suffered like yourself and also contemplated suicide indeed often since misfortune has left me I have longed for the delights of an eternal	190.31773376464844
25185/28840	But you are sure you will promise me this said Morrel	86.29764556884766
25186/28840	I not only promise but swear it said Monte Cristo extending his	52.92001724243164
25187/28840	I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of September it is ten years today since I saved your fathers life who wished to	39.88268280029297
25188/28840	Morrel seized the counts hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to	68.90586853027344
25189/28840	In a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that	91.8707275390625
25190/28840	Oh I also swear it   Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his	38.20722579956055
25191/28840	And now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy Haydées apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my	107.49445343017578
25192/28840	Haydée said Morrel what has become of her   She departed last	65.062744140625
25193/28840	To leave you   To wait for	42.443790435791016
25194/28840	Hold yourself ready then to join me at the ChampsÉlysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my	76.58248901367188
25195/28840	Maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike	244.37069702148438
25196/28840	Dividing the Proceeds   The apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue SaintGermaindesPrés where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious	147.31417846679688
25197/28840	Contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his _incognito_ was strictly	210.2157745361328
25198/28840	His visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oclock though he never spent the night	301.75811767578125
25199/28840	At halfpast three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same	136.73126220703125
25200/28840	At four oclock as we have already stated the mysterious personage	48.678245544433594
25201/28840	Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light	187.10775756835938
25202/28840	No one ever asked her where she was	264.08184814453125
25203/28840	Her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for	441.1327819824219
25204/28840	We need not say she stopped at the first	86.70756530761719
25205/28840	Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no	239.31915283203125
25206/28840	They used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the	330.4544982910156
25207/28840	The lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handker	145.81321716308594
25208/28840	The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten oclock in the morning instead of four in the	68.38829040527344
25209/28840	Almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily	848.8991088867188
25210/28840	Well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the ladys agitation revealed tell me what is the	112.2518081665039
25211/28840	Oh Lucien can I confide in you   Of course you know you can do	39.6088981628418
25212/28840	But what can be the matter Your note of this morning has completely bewildered	220.7196807861328
25213/28840	Come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at	358.8267517089844
25214/28840	Lucien a great event has happened said the lady glancing inquiringly at Lucien	90.06444549560547
25215/28840	Danglars left last night   Left	640.3651733398438
25216/28840	Danglars left Where has he gone   I do not	29.18414306640625
25217/28840	Then what did you mean   Stayhe left a letter for	77.54808807373047
25218/28840	A letter   Yes read	80.3050308227539
25219/28840	And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to Debr	36.05796813964844
25220/28840	Debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might	239.90391540527344
25221/28840	No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows   Madame and most faithful	62.83207702636719
25222/28840	Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with bl	56.37669372558594
25223/28840	Debray continued   When you receive this you will no longer have a	65.15985870361328
25224/28840	Oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of	100.91020965576172
25225/28840	I owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me I will give	89.37088012695312
25226/28840	I received this morning five millions which I paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me I put this creditor off till tomorrow and I intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to	278.44232177734375
25227/28840	For women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but I who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived	410.06451416015625
25228/28840	Have you admired the rapidity of my fall Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots I confess I have seen nothing but the fire let us hope you have found some gold among the	227.0374755859375
25229/28840	With this consoling idea I leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes I have already mentioned and above all the liberty I hasten to restore to	175.60977172851562
25230/28840	And here madame I must add another word of	182.12059020996094
25231/28840	So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter I philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another mans	152.77647399902344
25232/28840	You were rich when I married you but little	302.90869140625
25233/28840	Excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves I do not see why I should weigh my	175.055908203125
25234/28840	I have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned itwithout any fault of mine I can honestly	665.9927978515625
25235/28840	You madame have only sought to increase your own and I am convinced that you have	61.76914978027344
25236/28840	I leave you therefore as I took yourich but little	526.5526123046875
25237/28840	Adieu I also intend from this time to work on my own	146.80514526367188
25238/28840	Accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which I intend	1372.3271484375
25239/28840	Your very devoted husband   Baron Dangl	38.77365493774414
25240/28840	The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his selfcontrol change color once or	219.4028778076172
25241/28840	When he had ended the perusal he folded the letter and resumed his pensive	221.23727416992188
25242/28840	Well asked Madame Danglars with an anxiety easy to be	45.29318618774414
25243/28840	With what ideas does that letter inspire you   Oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that	108.98442840576172
25244/28840	Certainly but is this all you have to say to me   I do not understand you said Debray with freezing cold	38.06931686401367
25245/28840	He is gone Gone never to return   Oh madame do not think that   I tell you he will never	82.60298919677734
25246/28840	I know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own	208.63546752929688
25247/28840	Debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous	113.24549865722656
25248/28840	Well she said at length do you not answer me   I have but one question to ask youwhat do you intend to do   I was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating	26.83936882019043
25249/28840	Ah then you wish to ask advice of me   Yes I do wish to ask your advice said Madame Danglars with anxious	39.549842834472656
25250/28840	Then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly I would recommend you to	42.80099105834961
25251/28840	Danglars says you are rich and perfectly	54.637943267822266
25252/28840	In my opinion a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars broken contract and	106.51530456542969
25253/28840	The world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of op	555.4729614257812
25254/28840	You have only to remain in Paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the	258.3621520996094
25255/28840	Then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyones mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterested	495.2389831542969
25256/28840	They will know you are deserted and think you also poor for I alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest	278.9024963378906
25257/28840	The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had	128.41688537597656
25258/28840	Deserted she repeated ah yes I am indeed deserted You are right sir and no one can doubt my	427.8481140136719
25259/28840	These were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to Debr	863.4189453125
25260/28840	50137m       But then you are richvery rich indeed continued Debray taking out some papers from his pocketbook which he spread upon the	58.02367401123047
25261/28840	Madame Danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush	89.85138702392578
25262/28840	At length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single	243.812255859375
25263/28840	Madame said Debray it is nearly six months since we have been	48.12553787231445
25264/28840	You furnished a principal of 100000 franc	207.03811645507812
25265/28840	Our partnership began in the month of	889.249755859375
25266/28840	In May we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450000 franc	356.674072265625
25267/28840	In June the profit amounted to 900	2384.758544921875
25268/28840	In July we added 1700000 francsit was you know the month of the Spanish	379.5751647949219
25269/28840	Now madame said Debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still 80000 francs the interest of this money in my	150.31504821777344
25270/28840	But said the baroness I thought you never put the money out to	51.5882682800293
25271/28840	Excuse me madame said Debray coldly I had your permission to do so and I have made use of	31.05727767944336
25272/28840	There are then 40000 francs for your share besides the 100000 you furnished me to begin with making in all 1340000 francs for your	333.0329284667969
25273/28840	Now madame I took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and I was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my	152.31561279296875
25274/28840	There is your moneyhalf in banknotes the other half in checks payable to	4862.0615234375
25275/28840	Danglars will pay you the amount you may rest	55.64755630493164
25276/28840	Madame Danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank	163.36903381347656
25277/28840	This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the	214.0000762939453
25278/28840	Madame Danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the banknotes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocketbook and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of	298.0967712402344
25279/28840	Now madame said Debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at	69.8101577758789
25280/28840	You will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and I am ready to offer you all I possess on	109.31476593017578
25281/28840	Thank you sirthank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the	93.33109283447266
25282/28840	Debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say As you please mad	94.26844024658203
25283/28840	Bah said Debray when she had left these are fine projects She will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the B	381.5080261230469
25284/28840	Then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid	296.2396545410156
25285/28840	I have 1060000 francs remaining he	1417.837890625
25286/28840	What a pity Mademoiselle de Villefort is dead She suited me in every respect and I would have married	50.208133697509766
25287/28840	And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame Danglars departure before he left the	99.41564178466797
25288/28840	During this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his	194.51193237304688
25289/28840	Above the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a half with Madame Danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some	271.4488220214844
25290/28840	Mercédès and Albert were in that	17.330852508544922
25291/28840	It was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdens	723.6981811523438
25292/28840	Albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual	672.8973999023438
25293/28840	If he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly	246.8189697265625
25294/28840	50141m       Mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide	178.00340270996094
25295/28840	Amongst the Catalans Mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted	80.17700958251953
25296/28840	So long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new	411.08355712890625
25297/28840	And then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herselfof no one but	352.6922302246094
25298/28840	Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live	199.70973205566406
25299/28840	Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained	538.748291015625
25300/28840	Excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of	1855.8892822265625
25301/28840	But the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the	288.39801025390625
25302/28840	Mother exclaimed Albert just as Madame Danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please I want capital to build my plans	177.78150939941406
25303/28840	Capitalnothing replied Mercédès with a mournful	16.284229278564453
25304/28840	And I have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3000 franc	304.97698974609375
25305/28840	Alas dear mother said the young man I have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of	78.49835968017578
25306/28840	These 3000 francs are enormous and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the	888.4381103515625
25307/28840	You say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these 3000 francs said Mercédès	74.31901550292969
25308/28840	I think so answered Albert in a firm	38.2857666015625
25309/28840	We will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan at Marse	38.26165771484375
25310/28840	With 200 francs we can reach Marse	170.11856079101562
25311/28840	With 200 francsare you sure Albert   Oh as for that I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are	502.6621398925781
25312/28840	You will take your place in the _coupé_ to Châl	21.03776741027832
25313/28840	You see mother I treat you handsomely for thirtyfive franc	591.2437744140625
25314/28840	Let us put down 120 added Albert	6764.24267578125
25315/28840	You see I am generous am I not mother   But you my poor child   I do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself A young man does not require luxuries besides I know what travelling	118.18353271484375
25316/28840	With a postchaise and valet de chambre   Any way	66.48860168457031
25317/28840	But these 200 francs   Here they are and 200 more	140.20628356933594
25318/28840	See I have sold my watch for 100 francs and the guard and seals for	642.9192504882812
25319/28840	How fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the	95.4825210571289
25320/28840	Still the same story of superfluities Now I think we are rich since instead of the 114 francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of	521.690185546875
25321/28840	But we owe something in this house   Thirty francs but I pay that out of my 150 francsthat is understoodand as I require only eighty francs for my journey you see I am overwhelmed with	240.9032745361328
25322/28840	But whence have you obtained them   Listen to me mother and do not yield too much to	110.8776626586914
25323/28840	And Albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at	307.2162780761719
25324/28840	You cannot imagine mother how beautiful I think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial	153.63185119628906
25325/28840	You are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw   Dear child said Mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her	50.91132736206055
25326/28840	Indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to	236.5718231201172
25327/28840	I am not unhappy while I possess my son   Ah just so said Albert here begins the	164.7650909423828
25328/28840	Well mother I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the Spahis25 added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his selfabas	213.34320068359375
25329/28840	I thought my body was my own and that I might sell	80.67094421386719
25330/28840	I yesterday took the place of	208.98095703125
25331/28840	I sold myself for more than I thought I was worth he added attempting to smile I fetched 2000 franc	141.8368682861328
25332/28840	Then these 1000 francs said Mercédès shudder	67.58106994628906
25333/28840	Are the half of the sum mother the other will be paid in a	119.62660217285156
25334/28840	Mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her	42.868385314941406
25335/28840	The price of his blood she murm	193.96908569335938
25336/28840	Yes if I am killed said Albert	55.25746536254883
25337/28840	But I assure you mother I have a strong intention of defending my person and I never felt half so strong an inclination to live as I do	140.90478515625
25338/28840	Mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her	65.1496353149414
25339/28840	Well now you understand mother continued Albert here are more than 4000 francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two	252.31295776367188

25342/28840	What is life to meVery little without you mother for believe me but for you I should have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced his	206.78732299804688
25343/28840	Well I will live if you promise me still to hope and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my	100.14043426513672
25344/28840	Then I will go to the governor of Algeria he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier I will tell him my gloomy	262.91021728515625
25345/28840	I will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months I shall be an officer or	83.86474609375
25346/28840	If I am an officer your fortune is certain for I shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our	115.0301742553711
25347/28840	If I am killedwell then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortun	55.09730911254883
25348/28840	It is well replied Mercédès with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of	62.95407485961914
25349/28840	But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man I assure you we are or rather we shall be very	50.025150299072266
25350/28840	You are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation I have become simple in my tastes and am without passion I	242.607421875

25354/28840	Yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy	119.70579528808594
25355/28840	And so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of	744.3662109375
25356/28840	We can now part come I shall engage your	1169.3487548828125
25357/28840	And you my dear boy   I shall stay here for a few days longer we must accustom ourselves to	82.82168579101562
25358/28840	I want recommendations and some information relative to	3406.566162109375
25359/28840	I will join you again at Marse	41.763389587402344
25360/28840	Well be it solet us part said Mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cash	209.09909057617188
25361/28840	Albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the	126.61026763916016
25362/28840	Someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned	153.35214233398438
25363/28840	You Morcerf replied the secretary resting on the	75.75425720214844
25364/28840	Curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_ and he was	238.49176025390625
25365/28840	It was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in	60.149105072021484
25366/28840	Then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf   Pardon me he added with a smile I leave you	71.96770477294922
25367/28840	Mother he said turning towards Mercédès this is	33.34812927246094
25368/28840	Debray secretary of the Minister for the Interior once a friend of	387.9795837402344
25369/28840	How once stammered Debray what do you mean   I say so	31.67925262451172
25370/28840	Debray because I have no friends now and I ought not to have	40.81182098388672
25371/28840	I thank you for having recognized me	101.61900329589844
25372/28840	Debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interloc	135.4850311279297
25373/28840	Believe me dear Albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feelingbelieve me I feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way I can serve you I am	77.18798828125
25374/28840	In the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from	68.35467529296875
25375/28840	We are leaving Paris and when our journey is paid we shall have 5000 francs	162.0691680908203
25376/28840	This parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran	773.1806030273438
25377/28840	That day the ministers clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his illhum	153.29393005371094
25378/28840	But that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the Boulevard de la Madeleine and an income of 50000 liv	43.6335334777832
25379/28840	The next day just as Debray was signing the deed that is about five oclock in the afternoon Madame de Morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the _coupé_ of the diligence which closed upon	75.66389465332031
25380/28840	A man was hidden in Lafittes bankinghouse behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk he saw Mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw Albert	473.3490295410156
25381/28840	Then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with	89.69223022460938
25382/28840	The Lions Den   One division of La Force in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined is called the court of SaintBern	1219.8375244140625
25383/28840	The prisoners in their expressive language have named it the Lions Den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers	1647.331298828125
25384/28840	It is a prison within a prison the walls are double the thickness of the	1074.9019775390625
25385/28840	The gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and	1240.21337890625
25386/28840	The courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls over which the sun glances obliquely when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deform	1875.12451171875
25387/28840	On this paved yard are to be seenpacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadowsthe men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharp	619.0650024414062
25388/28840	The court of SaintBernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the	633.8224487304688
25389/28840	It is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron	507.1258850097656
25390/28840	In the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the Den might be seen	201.93287658691406
25391/28840	Some of the inmates of the Lions Den were watching the operations of the prisoners toilet with considerable	180.07693481445312
25392/28840	See the prince is pluming himself said one of the	641.3304443359375
25393/28840	Hes a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hairgrease hed take the shine off the gentlemen in white	3376.6376953125
25394/28840	His coat looks nearly new and his boots are	2275.403564453125
25395/28840	It is pleasant to have such welldressed brethren and those gendarmes behaved shame	881.6797485351562
25396/28840	What jealousy to tear such clothes   He looks like a bigbug said another dresses in fine	1698.5570068359375
25397/28840	And then to be here so young Oh what larks   Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was	275.67828369140625
25398/28840	Come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with	121.11985778808594
25399/28840	Remember I have relations who possess more millions than you have den	849.4141235351562
25400/28840	Come said Andrea you are a man void of compassion Ill have you turned	150.91769409179688
25401/28840	This made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud	220.8699188232422
25402/28840	The prisoners then approached and formed a	522.1677856445312
25403/28840	I tell you that with that wretched sum continued Andrea I could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I am daily	209.09909057617188
25404/28840	The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the	179.39993286132812
25405/28840	The latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate Andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long	432.4792175292969
25406/28840	The thieves had already approached Andrea some screaming _La savateLa savate_26 a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an ironheeled	3176.325927734375
25407/28840	Let us horsewhip the fine gentleman said	3584.09521484375
25408/28840	But Andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be	306.69696044921875
25409/28840	It was a Masonic sign Caderousse had taught	568.250732421875
25410/28840	He was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the ironheeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it	273.5401306152344
25411/28840	Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscienceand the mob	167.67623901367188
25412/28840	The keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the Lions Den to something more substantial than mere	533.8284912109375
25413/28840	Andrea made no resistance although he protested against	780.9808349609375
25414/28840	Suddenly a voice was heard at the w	54.63398361206055
25415/28840	To the visitors room said the same	349.0604553222656
25416/28840	You see someone pays me a	663.013671875
25417/28840	Ah my dear sir you will see whether a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person   And Andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in	113.06593322753906
25418/28840	Certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished Andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force had maintained a rigid	689.5130004882812
25419/28840	An unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not	452.67755126953125
25420/28840	The hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself sinking into the	233.74790954589844
25421/28840	Why should I risk an imprudent step It might alienate my	412.6204528808594
25422/28840	He has two means of extricating me from this dilemmathe one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with	4380.1787109375
25423/28840	I will say and do nothing until I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then   Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably	71.41027069091797
25424/28840	The unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the	321.7799987792969
25425/28840	He had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and	719.3665161132812
25426/28840	It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visiting	690.5537109375
25427/28840	Andrea felt his heart leap with	1066.1795654296875
25428/28840	It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped	191.45237731933594
25429/28840	Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of	84.18179321289062
25430/28840	Bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other gr	196.21249389648438
25431/28840	Good morning Benedetto said Bertuccio with his deep hollow	90.84642791748047
25432/28840	Youyou said the young man looking fearfully around	68.98490142822266
25433/28840	Do you not recognize me unhappy child   Silencebe silent said Andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for Heavens sake do not speak so loud   You wish to speak with me alone do you not said Bertucc	99.18490600585938
25434/28840	And Bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the w	80.0309066772461
25435/28840	An order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to	73.42158508300781
25436/28840	Then he mentally addedStill my unknown protector I am not	5608.40087890625
25437/28840	They wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private	159.59866333007812
25438/28840	I understand Bertuccio has been sent by my	57.70273208618164
25439/28840	The keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first	154.3430633544922
25440/28840	The room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous	889.2039794921875
25441/28840	Bertuccio sat down upon the chair Andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper	199.8651123046875
25442/28840	Now said the steward what have you to tell me   And you said	30.87781524658203
25443/28840	You must have much to tell me since you have come to seek	41.233917236328125

25445/28840	You have continued your course of villany you have robbedyou have	957.2573852539062
25446/28840	Well I should say If you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the	96.102783203125
25447/28840	But there are some with which on the contrary I am not	56.44751739501953

25458/28840	Well   Well in the ChampsÉlysées there resides a very rich	88.0138931274414
25459/28840	At whose house you robbed and murdered did you not   I believe I	118.94041442871094
25460/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo   Tis you who have named him as	32.49747848510742
25461/28840	Well am I to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying My father my father like Monsieur Pixéré	1339.3564453125
25462/28840	27   Do not let us jest gravely replied Bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced	73.4400405883789
25463/28840	Bah said Andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of Bertuccios manner why not   Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to be the father of such a wretch as	90.98585510253906
25464/28840	And there will be fine doings if you do not take	152.30442810058594
25465/28840	I will say   Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself said Bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that Andrea was moved to the very	110.9856185913086
25466/28840	Do you think you have to do with galleyslaves or novices in the world Benedetto you are fallen into terrible hands they are ready to open for youmake use of	137.70321655273438
25467/28840	Do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their	175.66798400878906

25470/28840	Come who is my father   I came to tell	21.258953094482422
25471/28840	Ah cried Benedetto his eyes sparkling with	37.635986328125
25472/28840	Just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to Bertuccio said   Excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the	61.67717361450195
25473/28840	And so closes our interview said Andrea to the worthy steward I wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil   I will return tomorrow said Bertucc	148.8456268310547
25474/28840	Good Gendarmes I am at your	56.350059509277344
25475/28840	Ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of   It shall be done replied Bertucc	55.32643508911133
25476/28840	Andrea extended his hand Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of	139.2299346923828
25477/28840	Thats what I mean said Andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of Bertucc	70.01217651367188
25478/28840	Can I be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad	597.3605346679688
25479/28840	Never mind we shall see Tomorrow then he added turning towards Bertucc	105.64634704589844
25480/28840	The Judge   We remember that the Abbé Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girls	54.91130065917969
25481/28840	de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the	35.80573272705078
25482/28840	The assizes also were about to begin and Villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Cader	108.70578002929688
25483/28840	This affair like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in	60.144229888916016
25484/28840	The proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galleyslave on his deathbed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his	199.33013916015625
25485/28840	But the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his selflove which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen	391.2518005371094
25486/28840	The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of Villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming ass	155.2275848388672
25487/28840	He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of	474.56396484375
25488/28840	And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his	227.65965270996094
25489/28840	Once only had Villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto when the latter was to learn his fathers	60.15266036987305
25490/28840	The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could scarcely	54.45020294189453
25491/28840	His glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that Villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was	194.33299255371094
25492/28840	Villefort became pale he understood the old mans	61.89524841308594
25493/28840	Madame de Villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sons ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a	160.97103881835938
25494/28840	Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the	85.64533996582031
25495/28840	Villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the	85.4411849975586
25496/28840	As he approached it Noirtiers gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his	94.38294982910156
25497/28840	In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible	213.8066864013672
25498/28840	Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten	69.8625717163086
25499/28840	It is well sir replied Villefort from belowit is well have patience but one day longer what I have said I will	78.16525268554688
25500/28840	Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other	45.23164367675781
25501/28840	Villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his	68.62260437011719
25502/28840	The next day Monday was the first sitting of the ass	646.8232421875
25503/28840	The morning dawned dull and gloomy and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red	284.5240783691406
25504/28840	The magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in	284.9978332519531
25505/28840	He opened the window a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the	170.72291564941406
25506/28840	In the cloverfields beyond the chestnuttrees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning	700.4848022460938
25507/28840	The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort and refreshed his	420.5111389160156
25508/28840	Today he said with an efforttoday the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is	309.1588439941406
25509/28840	Involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtiers room where he had seen him the preceding	131.7330322265625
25510/28840	The curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old	79.74983978271484
25511/28840	His head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and	260.0816345214844
25512/28840	Villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of	334.8804626464844
25513/28840	What are you bringing me said	101.60941314697266
25514/28840	Who has paid me this attention   My mistress	186.09971618652344
25515/28840	She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with	97.77316284179688
25516/28840	Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one dra	80.83124542236328
25517/28840	It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than	103.5755844116211
25518/28840	He then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to	78.67214965820312
25519/28840	Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven oclock has just struck and that the trial commences at	87.31035614013672
25520/28840	Well said Villefort what then   Madame de Villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir   Where to   To the Pal	34.689781188964844
25521/28840	What to do   My mistress wishes much to be present at the	114.5899658203125
25522/28840	Ah said Villefort with a startling accent does she wish that   The servant drew back and said If you wish to go alone sir I will go and tell my	75.92186737060547
25523/28840	Villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his	74.82333374023438
25524/28840	Tell your mistress he at length answered that I wish to speak to her and I beg she will wait for me in her own	79.5810317993164
25525/28840	Then come to dress and shave	4703.73388671875
25526/28840	The valet reappeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in	751.4068603515625
25527/28840	When he had finished he said   My mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished	92.73270416259766
25528/28840	And Villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his	68.43399047851562
25529/28840	At the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale	108.30918884277344
25530/28840	Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young Edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading	636.4215087890625
25531/28840	She was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her	135.49949645996094
25532/28840	de Villefort remained mute and cold as a	50.35336685180664
25533/28840	Edward said Villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawingroom my dear I wish to speak to your mam	46.20609664916992
25534/28840	Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange prelimin	102.1978530883789
25535/28840	Edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the heads of his leaden	142.22364807128906
25536/28840	de Villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear meGo   The child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or	313.1117248535156
25537/28840	His father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his	47.96846008300781
25538/28840	de Villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and	41.03060531616211
25539/28840	Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its	345.0543518066406
25540/28840	A hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly	228.12168884277344
25541/28840	Monsieur she said II do not understand	71.81539916992188
25542/28840	And in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cush	102.86746978759766
25543/28840	I asked you continued Villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my fatherinlaw	50.21347427368164

25550/28840	Then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger It is true then you do not deny it She moved	119.01921081542969
25551/28840	And you cannot deny it added Villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of	49.40868377685547
25552/28840	You have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded	498.0068054199219

25555/28840	Oh sir she stammered I beseech you do not believe	69.49506378173828
25556/28840	Are you then a coward cried Villefort in a contemptuous	30.299057006835938
25557/28840	But I have always observed that poisoners were cow	192.1875
25558/28840	You have done thisI hope so at	109.77271270751953
25559/28840	Madame de Villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her	26.19166374206543
25560/28840	Madame de Villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted	181.4976806640625
25561/28840	Oh do not fear the scaffold madame said the magistrate I will not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself no if you have heard me distinctly you will understand that you are not to die on the scaff	60.894290924072266

25634/28840	de Villeforts is that there is an assassin in the house   The two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to	29.672279357910156
25635/28840	And who is the assassin they asked	539.5753784179688

25639/28840	It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased	266.78826904296875
25640/28840	and Madame de SaintMéran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixirthree drops were sufficient then followed Barrois the old servant of	177.18072509765625

25642/28840	Why what nonsense are you telling us said ChâteauRen	30.41952896118164
25643/28840	Yes it is an extraordinary story said Beauchamp is it not   It is absurd said Debr	24.083080291748047
25644/28840	Ah said Beauchamp you doubt me Well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the	109.23421478271484
25645/28840	And this elixir where is it what is it   The child conceals	101.9091796875
25646/28840	But where did he find it   In his mothers	230.06790161132812

25654/28840	But I do not see the Count of Monte Cristo	13.641928672790527

25656/28840	Still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was	64.48790740966797
25657/28840	Ah now I think of it the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the hall said Beauch	26.623672485351562
25658/28840	Why not   Because he is an actor in the	142.67752075195312
25659/28840	Has he assassinated anyone then   No on the contrary they wished to assassinate	73.50790405273438

25661/28840	de Caderousse was murdered by his friend Benedet	43.323699951171875

25731/28840	All eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a	81.57035064697266
25732/28840	Gentlemen said Andrea commanding silence by his voice and manner I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have	314.0909118652344

25734/28840	I said anything I pleased in order that the solemn declaration I have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the	226.4216766357422

25738/28840	A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of	124.29562377929688
25739/28840	But how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the	37.792236328125
25740/28840	A man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried	172.31422424316406
25741/28840	He was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still	271.6714172363281
25742/28840	The man carried me to the foundling asylum where I was registered under the number	2559.730224609375

25747/28840	I increased in wickedness till I committed	1721.154052734375

25753/28840	Just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hyster	183.16429138183594

25760/28840	The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of aston	150.19268798828125
25761/28840	Father said Benedetto I am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them   No no it is useless stammered	52.17406463623047
25762/28840	de Villefort in a hoarse voice no it is useless   How useless cried the president what do you mean   I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes	77.13434600830078

25764/28840	A dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in	498.949951171875
25765/28840	de Villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination What are you no longer in possession of your senses This strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your	162.69012451171875
25766/28840	The procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly	101.27936553955078
25767/28840	I am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may	204.75938415527344
25768/28840	I acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed	116.30268096923828
25769/28840	And as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door	54.79240036010742
25770/28840	The whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian	131.71688842773438
25771/28840	Well said Beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural   _Ma foi_ said ChâteauRenaud I would rather end my career like	42.48735809326172

25774/28840	She did well to die poor girl   The sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another	976.0975341796875

25776/28840	Well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked Debray of the sergeantatarms slipping a louis into his	75.86925506591797
25777/28840	There will be extenuating circumstances he	321.53692626953125
25778/28840	Expiation   Notwithstanding the density of the crowd	1541.531005859375
25779/28840	de Villefort saw it open before	49.2850341796875
25780/28840	There is something so aweinspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great	238.75721740722656
25781/28840	Many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during	611.6298217773438
25782/28840	Thus Villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the Palais and	64.52383422851562
25783/28840	Though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his	327.3721923828125
25784/28840	There are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of	700.7486572265625
25785/28840	Those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as	389.64337158203125
25786/28840	It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort left the Pal	39.71467590332031

25789/28840	Having staggered as far as the Rue Dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the Faubourg SaintHonoré the carriage drove	50.269744873046875
25790/28840	All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already	556.3838500976562

25792/28840	Villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against	374.08795166015625
25793/28840	He put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like	120.71941375732422
25794/28840	50189m       Oh he exclaimed as though a redhot iron were piercing his	125.44001770019531
25795/28840	During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented	433.610595703125
25796/28840	We will flee from Paris and go as far as the earth	205.24679565429688
25797/28840	And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the	64.70870208740234
25798/28840	Faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coach	472.14727783203125
25799/28840	The horses impelled by fear flew towards the	265.54510498046875
25800/28840	Yes yes repeated Villefort as he approached his homeyes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my	432.2967529296875

25802/28840	We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her	217.85267639160156
25803/28840	She will repent and no one will know that she has been	112.14112091064453
25804/28840	The events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then I will add them to my list of	226.70416259765625
25805/28840	What will it signify if one two or three more are added My wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with	305.3110656738281
25806/28840	I shall have performed a good action and my heart will be	265.5967712402344
25807/28840	And the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some	76.36103820800781
25808/28840	50191m       The carriage stopped at the door of the	10.075019836425781
25809/28840	Villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their	65.42796325683594
25810/28840	Neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing	184.64012145996094
25811/28840	Noirtiers room he perceived two figures through the halfopen door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on	224.58572387695312
25812/28840	Come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifes room nothing is changed	109.55784606933594
25813/28840	He then closed the door of the	62.83543014526367
25814/28840	No one must disturb us he said I must speak freely to her accuse myself and sayhe approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his	358.2784423828125
25815/28840	Not locked he cried that is	255.66868591308594
25816/28840	And he entered the little room in which Edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at	121.19490051269531
25817/28840	With a single glance Villeforts eye ran through the	84.427734375
25818/28840	Not here he said doubtless she is in her	207.69943237304688
25819/28840	He rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shudder	205.52716064453125
25820/28840	He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being	47.7325553894043
25821/28840	Who is there answered the voice of her he	123.09288787841797
25822/28840	He thought that voice more feeble than	363.429931640625
25823/28840	But notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained	184.8633575439453
25824/28840	Villefort burst it open with a violent	81.9322280883789
25825/28840	At the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir Madame de Villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring	116.8626937866211
25826/28840	Héloïse Héloïse he said what is the matter Speak The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards	97.49341583251953
25827/28840	It is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her	64.88729095458984
25828/28840	What more do you want and she fell full length on the	131.748291015625
25829/28840	Villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden sto	138.9326934814453
25830/28840	Villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the	169.94082641601562
25831/28840	My son he exclaimed suddenly where is my sonEdward Edward and he rushed out of the room still crying Edward Edward The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran	308.5160217285156
25832/28840	Where is my son asked Villefort let him be removed from the house that he may not see   Master Edward is not downstairs sir replied the val	48.98677062988281

25835/28840	A cold perspiration burst out on Villeforts brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered	149.0798797607422
25836/28840	In Madame de Villeforts room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the	48.22139358520508
25837/28840	To enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate	91.44734191894531
25838/28840	To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the silence of the	259.8986511230469

25842/28840	The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious	232.14450073242188
25843/28840	Through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin	147.5502471923828
25844/28840	Villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lyingno doubt asleepon the	373.2149353027344
25845/28840	The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and	62.806766510009766
25846/28840	He had only to step over the corpse enter the boudoir take the child in his arms and flee far far	280.7471618652344

25852/28840	A folded paper fell from Edwards	2428.5546875

25854/28840	He picked up the paper and recognizing his wifes writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows   You know that I was a good mother since it was for my sons sake I became	110.84732055664062

25860/28840	50195m       He descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered Noirtiers	37.16268539428711
25861/28840	The old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the Abbé Busoni who looked cold and calm as	80.60777282714844
25862/28840	Villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his	12.40962028503418
25863/28840	The past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the	1085.4888916015625
25864/28840	He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at Auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of Valentines	54.029518127441406
25865/28840	I came to pray over the body of your	105.51952362060547

25867/28840	It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard	23.515674591064453
25868/28840	That voice that voicewhere did I first hear it   You heard it for the first time at Marseilles twentythree years ago the day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de SaintMé	41.264122009277344

25871/28840	With an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into Valentines room of which he doublelocked the	119.85555267333984
25872/28840	This lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the	167.9580078125
25873/28840	A quarter of an hour afterwards the door of Valentines room opened and Monte Cristo reapp	20.735431671142578
25874/28840	Pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by	238.50973510742188
25875/28840	In his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to	158.8994598388672
25876/28840	Bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her	348.0507507324219
25877/28840	Then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked   Where is	107.97595977783203
25878/28840	de Villefort   The servant instead of answering pointed to the	40.69069290161133
25879/28840	Monte Cristo ran down the steps and advancing towards the spot designated beheld Villefort encircled by his servants with a spade in his hand and digging the earth with	72.98963928222656
25880/28840	It is not here   50197m       And then he moved farther on and began again to	115.43029022216797
25881/28840	Monte Cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble   Sir you have indeed lost a son but   Villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor	70.7949447631836
25882/28840	Oh I _will_ find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but I _will_ find him though I dig forever   Monte Cristo drew back in	206.24156188964844
25883/28840	Oh he said he is mad And as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had	69.37600708007812
25884/28840	Oh enough of thisenough of this he cried let me save the	666.5659790039062
25885/28840	On entering his house he met Morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the	524.6143188476562
25886/28840	Prepare yourself Maximilian he said with a smile we leave Paris	103.22852325439453
25887/28840	Have you nothing more to do there asked Mor	82.06552124023438
25888/28840	No replied Monte Cristo God grant I may not have done too much	94.240478515625
25889/28840	The next day they indeed left accompanied only by Baptist	876.1041870117188
25890/28840	Haydée had taken away Ali and Bertuccio remained with Noirt	69.95160675048828
25891/28840	The Departure   The recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all	201.67921447753906
25892/28840	Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf Danglars and Ville	55.73378372192383
25893/28840	Maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of ap	144.49578857421875
25894/28840	What dreadful sufferings said Julie remembering Valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her	521.8772583007812
25895/28840	If the Supreme Being has directed the fatal blow said Emmanuel it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful	459.3617248535156
25896/28840	Do you not form a very rash judgment Emmanuel said	1198.101318359375
25897/28840	When my father with a pistol in his hand was once on the point of committing suicide had anyone then said This man deserves his misery would not that person have been deceived   Yes but your father was not allowed to	155.08456420898438
25898/28840	A being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on	300.82025146484375
25899/28840	Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard the wellknown signal given by the porter that a visitor had	60.077186584472656
25900/28840	Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared on the	12.08513069152832
25901/28840	The young people uttered a cry of joy while Maximilian raised his head but let it fall again	45.83446502685547
25902/28840	50201m       Maximilian said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle I come to seek	56.07852554321289
25903/28840	To seek me repeated Morrel as if awakening from a	276.63299560546875
25904/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo has it not been agreed that I should take you with me and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure   I am ready said Maximilian I came expressly to wish them	41.36119842529297
25905/28840	Whither are you going count asked	363.3348083496094
25906/28840	In the first instance to Marseilles mad	81.76385498046875
25907/28840	Yes and I take your brother with	80.9212875366211
25908/28840	said Julie will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his count	195.87875366210938
25909/28840	You perceive then that he is not happy said the	60.79680633544922
25910/28840	Yes replied the young woman and fear much that he finds our home but a dull	271.16925048828125
25911/28840	I will undertake to divert him replied the	73.51112365722656
25912/28840	I am ready to accompany you sir said Maximil	20.508201599121094
25913/28840	I have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said Morrel in his tranquil but mournful	160.1859588623047
25914/28840	Good said Monte Cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a welldisciplined	846.3010864257812
25915/28840	And you leave us said Julie at a moments warning you do not give us a dayno not even an hour before your departure   My carriage is at the door madame and I must be in Rome in five	101.5835952758789
25916/28840	But does Maximilian go to Rome exclaimed	185.82040405273438
25917/28840	I am going wherever it may please the count to take me said Morrel with a smile full of grief I am under his orders for the next	63.892059326171875
25918/28840	Oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count said	2743.386474609375
25919/28840	Maximilian goes with _me_ said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brothers	156.3756103515625
25920/28840	Once more farewell my dear sister Emmanuel adieu Morrel	507.83172607421875
25921/28840	His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said	624.6798095703125
25922/28840	Oh Maximilian Maximilian you are certainly concealing something from	65.6253662109375
25923/28840	Pshaw said Monte Cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and	110.35816192626953
25924/28840	Maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the	108.89794158935547
25925/28840	We must leave you said Monte Crist	25.209630966186523
25926/28840	Like benefactors in romances I should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because I am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellowcreat	136.02426147460938
25927/28840	On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so far as to say Do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me	132.4147491455078
25928/28840	Never see you again exclaimed Emmanuel while two large tears rolled down Julies cheeks never behold you again It is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do	190.7828369140625
25929/28840	Say not so quickly returned Monte Cristosay not so my friends angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to	1446.351806640625
25930/28840	Fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome	250.9977569580078
25931/28840	No Emmanuel I am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrileg	141.29637145996094
25932/28840	Restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered Julie to Monte Crist	224.0251922607422
25933/28840	And the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to Morrels	132.15802001953125
25934/28840	You still confide then in Sinbad the Sailor asked he	105.34854125976562
25935/28840	Well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the	464.2274475097656
25936/28840	As we have before said the postchaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while Ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in pers	144.28799438476562
25937/28840	Well asked the count in Arabic have you been to see the old man Ali made a sign in the	62.675636291503906
25938/28840	And have you placed the letter before him as I ordered you to do   The slave respectfully signalized that he	154.62033081054688
25939/28840	50205m       These words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the	59.558773040771484
25940/28840	Maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a	60.05696487426758
25941/28840	Half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken checkstring which was fastened to Alis	215.80564880371094
25942/28840	The Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage	163.01876831054688
25943/28840	The count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short	72.01689910888672
25944/28840	With folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great	325.619140625
25945/28840	I believe that the Spirit of God led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls I have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my	201.63267517089844
25946/28840	God only knows that I retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless	250.95945739746094
25947/28840	Oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that I have found that which I sought like a patient miner I have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil	686.2891845703125
25948/28840	Now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor	2228.705078125
25949/28840	Ten leagues were passed and not a single word was	229.03167724609375
25950/28840	Morrel was dreaming and Monte Cristo was looking at the dream	66.23643493652344
25951/28840	Morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me   No count but to leave Paris   If I thought happiness might await you in Paris Morrel I would have left you	88.70783233642578
25952/28840	Valentine reposes within the walls of Paris and to leave Paris is like losing her a second	144.98512268066406
25953/28840	Maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by	67.63909912109375
25954/28840	I have two friends who in this way never depart from me the one who gave me being and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on	226.16970825195312
25955/28840	I consult them when doubtful and if I ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsel	503.589111328125
25956/28840	Listen to the voice of your heart Morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards	237.39540100097656
25957/28840	My friend said Maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but	95.45753479003906
25958/28840	It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black	372.13836669921875

25960/28840	That may possibly be true said Maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful	104.09716033935547
25961/28840	The journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever	176.50360107421875
25962/28840	Towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once	510.92449951171875
25963/28840	The following morning they arrived at Châlons where the counts steamboat waited for	173.6231231689453
25964/28840	Without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without	135.6533660888672
25965/28840	The boat was built for speed her two paddlewheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a	2347.917236328125
25966/28840	Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected	165.17636108398438
25967/28840	As the distance increased between the travellers and Paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native	352.04266357421875

25972/28840	Monte Cristo gently smiled and saidI was there at the same time pointing to the corner of a	95.24261474609375
25973/28840	As he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to	243.5163116455078
25974/28840	Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the	57.44376754760742
25975/28840	Oh heavens exclaimed Morrel I do not deceive myselfthat young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is Albert de Morcerf   Yes said Monte Cristo I recognized	72.78955078125
25976/28840	How soyou were looking the other	435.7176513671875
25977/28840	50209m       The count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the	24.13571548461914
25978/28840	Turning to his friend   Dear Maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land   I have to weep over the grave of my father replied Morrel in a broken	40.120079040527344
25979/28840	Well then gowait for me there and I will soon join	320.0341796875
25980/28840	You leave me then   Yes I also have a pious visit to	80.76943969726562
25981/28840	Morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the	76.09812927246094
25982/28840	Monte Cristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight he then walked slowly towards the Allées de Meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this	66.7032699584961
25983/28840	Two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came	456.6943664550781
25984/28840	The woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house she had scarcely closed the door after her when Monte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same	82.39138793945312
25985/28840	The worn out steps were old acquaintances of his he knew better than anyone else how to open that weatherbeaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch	722.7904663085938
25986/28840	He entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the	70.6771240234375
25987/28840	At the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and	823.6919555664062
25988/28840	In this garden Mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twentyfour years	84.01741027832031
25989/28840	The trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street	96.44124603271484
25990/28840	She had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her	160.0203094482422
25991/28840	Monte Cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the	50.22737503051758
25992/28840	Mercédès raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before	24.892457962036133

25995/28840	Had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your grief	265.8974914550781
25996/28840	He will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into	2456.789306640625

25999/28840	The bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and I feel that the grave is not far	445.2171936035156

26008/28840	I once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am I   Monte Cristo approached her and silently took her	232.4995574951172

26017/28840	Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a	134.30279541015625
26018/28840	It often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole	441.7076110839844

26020/28840	You are a nobleminded woman and it was your grief that disarmed	88.0838394165039

26022/28840	I take that God to witness at whose feet I have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years that I would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with	304.3623046875

26025/28840	From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular	166.963134765625
26026/28840	Not a thought was given to a life which you once Mercédès had the power to render blissful not one hour of peaceful calm was mine but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating	313.1889343261719

26034/28840	I live as it were between two	383.0039367675781
26035/28840	One is that of Edmond Dantès lost to me long long	54.39872741699219

26037/28840	The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of Edmond Dantè	37.667442321777344
26038/28840	I approve of the deed but I must pray for the	112.97366333007812
26039/28840	Your son shall be happy Mercédès repeated the	31.56491470336914
26040/28840	Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly	445.5682678222656
26041/28840	But what are your intentions   Mercédès smiled	21.06695556640625
26042/28840	To say that I shall live here like the Mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe	120.32190704345703
26043/28840	I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in	113.81229400634766
26044/28840	However I shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which I found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain	88.77574920654297
26045/28840	Rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of livingthat will signify but little that concerns God you and	1019.0364990234375
26046/28840	Mercédès said the count I do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by	91.5790786743164
26047/28840	de Morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and	231.9727783203125
26048/28840	I perceive what you are intending to propose to me but I cannot accept it Edmondmy son would not permit	70.25663757324219
26049/28840	Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de Morcer	53.56947708129883
26050/28840	I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to	78.0398941040039

26052/28840	I have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that I am become passive in the hands of the Almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an	252.1098175048828
26053/28840	I live because it is not ordained for me to	135.7469940185547
26054/28840	If succor be sent to me I will accept	85.50525665283203
26055/28840	Ah madame said Monte Cristo you should not talk thus It is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free	73.78863525390625
26056/28840	Alas exclaimed Mercédès if it were so if I possessed freewill but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to	227.19244384765625
26057/28840	Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her	44.139808654785156
26058/28840	Will you not even say you will see me again he	78.67469787597656
26059/28840	On the contrary we shall meet again said Mercédès pointing to heaven with solemn	41.982704162597656

26061/28840	And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count Mercédès rushed up the stairs and	59.60903549194336
26062/28840	Monte Cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the qu	71.93096160888672
26063/28840	But Mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dantè	26.179096221923828
26064/28840	The Past   The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès probably never to behold her	61.891029357910156
26065/28840	Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Crist	72.6902084350586
26066/28840	Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before	217.8400115966797
26067/28840	More than this the conversation which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with	71.60865020751953
26068/28840	A man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior	592.586669921875
26069/28840	He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame	146.76356506347656
26070/28840	I cannot have deceived myself he said I must look upon the past in a false	108.3788833618164
26071/28840	The reason why I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the	322.545654296875
26072/28840	The past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we	856.3236083984375
26073/28840	My position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received	139.1510772705078

26075/28840	Too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks to behold Dantè	120.5499038696289
26076/28840	Hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse   As he thus reasoned Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la Caiss	734.8274536132812
26077/28840	It was the same through which twentyfour years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and	174.3190460205078
26078/28840	And yet they were the same murmured Monte Cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so	226.5722198486328
26079/28840	He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue SaintLaurent and advanced to the Consigne it was the point where he had	216.94398498535156
26080/28840	A pleasureboat with striped awning was going	6137.02001953125
26081/28840	Monte Cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good	149.60557556152344
26082/28840	The weather was magnificent and the excursion a	516.0250244140625
26083/28840	The sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming	2563.94970703125
26084/28840	Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantè	993.6749267578125
26085/28840	Clear sky swiftflitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the Château dIf seemed like the phantom of a mortal	237.50250244140625
26086/28840	As they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice   Sir we are at the	79.84028625488281
26087/28840	Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayon	124.46507263183594
26088/28840	The journey had seemed very long to Dantès but Monte Cristo found it equally	73.35558319091797
26089/28840	Each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the	254.65103149414062
26090/28840	50219m       There had been no prisoners confined in the Château dIf since the revolution of July it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of	119.7303466796875
26091/28840	A concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of	371.9403991699219
26092/28840	The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other	314.3827819824219
26093/28840	The concierge who attended him had only been there since	589.9395751953125
26094/28840	He again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow	168.1383819580078
26095/28840	His eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had	136.69371032714844
26096/28840	Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of	124.08357238769531
26097/28840	Monte Cristo shuddered Antoine had been his jail	75.05388641357422
26098/28840	The count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concier	85.33283996582031
26099/28840	Would you like to hear the story sir   Yes relate it said Monte Cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own	85.93624114990234
26100/28840	This dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of	123.35693359375
26101/28840	Another person was confined in the Château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad	63.09213638305664
26102/28840	Ah indeedmad repeated Monte Cristo and what was his mania   He offered millions to anyone who would set him at	165.60482788085938
26103/28840	Monte Cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firm	55.40838623046875
26104/28840	He thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria offered the	168.73956298828125
26105/28840	Could the prisoners see each other he	125.43354797363281
26106/28840	Oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the	223.55181884765625
26107/28840	And which of them made this passage   Oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an	136.10342407226562
26108/28840	However be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his	195.33311462402344
26109/28840	Do you see it and the man held the torch to the	113.8741226196289
26110/28840	50223m       Ah yes I see said the count in a voice hoarse from	19.098854064941406
26111/28840	The result was that the two men communicated with one another how long they did so nobody	273.5830078125
26112/28840	One day the old man fell ill and	214.7348175048828
26113/28840	Now guess what the young one did   Tell	170.89549255371094
26114/28840	He carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead	92.07676696777344
26115/28840	Did you ever hear of such an idea   Monte Cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his	83.16229248046875
26116/28840	The jailer continued   Now this was his	136.6929931640625
26117/28840	They never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannonball to the feet and then threw them into the	193.02272033691406
26118/28840	The count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of	124.95561981201172
26119/28840	No he muttered the doubt I felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for	697.0947265625
26120/28840	And the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards   Oh no of course	182.23281860351562
26121/28840	_Ma foi_ yes though he was in his own	119.88065338134766
26122/28840	What do you mean   The report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the Bonapart	61.839115142822266
26123/28840	Then the count added aloud Was his name ever known   Oh yes but only as	224.5921630859375
26124/28840	Oh Villefort Villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours   Do you wish to see anything more sir said the concier	62.754432678222656
26125/28840	Yes especially if you will show me the poor abbés	48.16138458251953
26126/28840	repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his	98.45035552978516
26127/28840	Wait said Monte Cristo I wish to take one final glance around this	76.19020080566406
26128/28840	This is fortunate said the guide I have forgotten the other	241.8425750732422
26129/28840	I will leave you the torch	135.3384552001953
26130/28840	No take it away I can see in the	66.13001251220703
26131/28840	They said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his	88.84333038330078
26132/28840	He spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the	189.41183471679688
26133/28840	Scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by	152.3336944580078
26134/28840	Then he looked around him and really recognized his	177.16586303710938
26135/28840	Yes he said there is the stone upon which I used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the	104.79761505126953
26136/28840	Oh those figures how well I remember them I made them one day to calculate the age of my father that I might know whether I should find him still living and that of Mercédès to know if I should find her still	82.48609161376953
26137/28840	After finishing that calculation I had a minutes	1370.9810791015625
26138/28840	I did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the	195.72068786621094
26139/28840	He saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of Mercédè	63.42901611328125
26140/28840	Oh God thou hast preserved my memory I thank thee I thank thee   At this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall the guide was coming Monte Cristo went to meet	69.9900131225586
26141/28840	Follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another	274.19293212890625
26142/28840	There again Monte Cristo was assailed by a multitude of	64.95768737792969
26143/28840	The first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had	90.01361846923828
26144/28840	The sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his	161.65708923339844
26145/28840	This is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained un	98.13098907470703
26146/28840	From the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten	199.09730529785156
26147/28840	Poor things Those must have been ten weary	660.2909545898438
26148/28840	Dantès took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied	52.974796295166016
26149/28840	The guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value but the light of the torch revealed their true	388.917236328125
26150/28840	Sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me	71.15676879882812
26151/28840	The concierge looked upon the count with	57.317440032958984

26159/28840	I do not knowI only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners	237.8942108154297
26160/28840	And have you them yet   No sir I sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but I have still something	241.53256225585938
26161/28840	What is it asked the count impatient	41.17034149169922
26162/28840	A sort of book written upon strips of	2919.811279296875
26163/28840	Go and fetch it my good fellow and if it be what I hope you will do	57.8219108581543
26164/28840	I will run for it sir and the guide went	201.6280517578125
26165/28840	Then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an	63.15739059448242
26166/28840	Here sir said a voice behind	141.08738708496094
26167/28840	The concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the Abbé Faria had spread the riches of his	88.62899017333984
26168/28840	The manuscript was the great work by the Abbé Faria upon the kingdoms of	84.17508697509766

26170/28840	Ah he exclaimed here is my	151.4993438720703
26171/28840	And feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocketbook which contained ten banknotes each of 1000 franc	260.28582763671875
26172/28840	The victory was complete twice he had overcome his	743.4730224609375

26177/28840	Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the gravedigger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the church	127.8260498046875

26184/28840	The dead are everywhere said Morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left Paris   Maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at Marse	53.62195587158203
26185/28840	Do you still wish to do so   I have no wishes count only I fancy I could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere	226.98789978027344

26192/28840	He remained there fourteen years Morrel said the count placing his hand on the young mans	55.4106559753418
26193/28840	During that time he had many moments of	198.9561004638672

26197/28840	One day he miraculously left the prison transformed rich	1403.3074951171875
26198/28840	His first cry was for his father but that father was	221.1656494140625
26199/28840	My father too is dead said Mor	145.27114868164062
26200/28840	He was then a more unhappy son than you Morrel for he could not even find his fathers	154.2339630126953

26207/28840	Only remember   On the 5th of October Morrel I shall expect you at the Island of Monte Crist	30.344594955444336

26211/28840	I leave you alone in your struggle with misfortunealone with that strongwinged eagle which God sends to bear aloft the elect to his	1171.4215087890625

26214/28840	Will you accompany me to the harbor Maximilian   50233m       I am entirely yours	117.55398559570312
26215/28840	Morrel accompanied the count to the	114.80484771728516
26216/28840	The white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chim	256.0504150390625
26217/28840	The steamer soon disappeared and in an hour afterwards as the count had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the	269.7353210449219
26218/28840	Peppino   At the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgiou a man travelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed the little town of Aquapend	225.14212036132812
26219/28840	He was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting	282.9731140136719
26220/28840	This man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under	333.82708740234375
26221/28840	He might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a	107.6063003540039
26222/28840	Another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other Italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of Figaro served all possible linguistic	1279.343505859375
26223/28840	_Allegro_ he called out to the postilions at every	1123.5263671875
26224/28840	And heaven knows there are hills enough between Rome and Florence by the way of Aquapendente These two words greatly amused the men to whom they were	391.78887939453125
26225/28840	Old Pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in	254.7875518798828
26226/28840	The traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of Thomson  French which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in	64.455078125
26227/28840	It was situated in the Via dei Banchi near	625.960205078125
26228/28840	In Rome as everywhere else the arrival of a postchaise is an	207.1454620361328
26229/28840	Now as these street Arabs of Rome more fortunate than those of Paris understand every language more especially the French they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of Thomson 	357.2466735839844
26230/28840	The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson  French that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers	55.595176696777344
26231/28840	He reached it before the carriage	212.8143768310547
26232/28840	The Frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in Rome at the doors of bankinghouses churches museums or theat	457.61669921875

26234/28840	An attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first	211.74383544921875
26235/28840	Whom shall I announce said the	1338.2303466796875
26236/28840	A door opened through which the attendant and the baron	179.6007537841797
26237/28840	The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a	34.92214584350586
26238/28840	The clerk continued to write for the next five minutes the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motion	230.8809356689453
26239/28840	Then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy   Ah ha he said here you are Peppino   Yes was the laconic	127.13374328613281
26240/28840	You have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman   There is no great merit due to me for we were informed of	118.89969635009766
26241/28840	_Pardieu_ he has come to draw but I dont know how much   You will know presently my	38.26200485229492
26242/28840	Very well only do not give me false information as you did the other	148.50738525390625
26243/28840	What do you meanof whom do you speak Was it the Englishman who carried off 3000 crowns from here the other day   50237m       No he really had 3000 crowns and we found	149.14663696289062

26245/28840	In that case he must either have paid his debts   A Russian do that   Or spent the money   Possibly after	177.12472534179688
26246/28840	But you must let me make my observations or the Frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the	368.81427001953125
26247/28840	Peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the attendant had gone	197.18238830566406
26248/28840	At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming count	240.68685913085938

26250/28840	On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo   Why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this   I told you we were informed	30.090316772460938
26251/28840	Then why do you apply to me   That I may be sure I have the right	37.18994140625

26253/28840	Danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the	49.26424026489258
26254/28840	According to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the	56.66239929199219
26255/28840	Guides are useful people who will turn their hands to	643.1842041015625
26256/28840	Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of	18.123464584350586
26257/28840	The _cicerone_ reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coach	49.47593688964844
26258/28840	Will your excellency visit Saint Peters asked the _cicerone	56.45500183105469
26259/28840	I did not come to Rome to see said Danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile I came to touch and he rapped his pocketbook in which he had just placed a	49.79642868041992
26260/28840	Then your excellency is going   To the	28.584074020385742
26261/28840	Casa Pastrini said the _cicerone_ to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly	45.87477111816406
26262/28840	Danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his	146.8135528564453
26263/28840	Peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of _morra_ with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of Orviet	473.913818359375
26264/28840	The next morning Danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at	88.90473937988281
26265/28840	He breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the Eternal City ordered posthorses at	867.0537719726562
26266/28840	But Danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting	106.8262939453125
26267/28840	The horses only arrived at two oclock and the _cicerone_ did not bring the passport till	45.681697845458984

26269/28840	The baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excell	140.5647430419922
26270/28840	As Danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your high	133.8251953125
26271/28840	Which road asked the postilion in	300.48162841796875
26272/28840	Signor Pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped	123.1776123046875
26273/28840	Danglars intended travelling to Venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to Vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of	152.84884643554688
26274/28840	He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began to	265.6366882324219
26275/28840	Danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next	93.64581298828125
26276/28840	_Non capisco_ do not understand was the	15036.7265625
26277/28840	Danglars bent his head which he meant to imply Very	47.043212890625
26278/28840	I will stop at the first postinghouse said Danglars to	111.3569107055664
26279/28840	He still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights	105.17652893066406
26280/28840	He was luxuriously stretched in a good English calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven	346.3572692871094
26281/28840	But the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was _Non capisco	397.4561462402344
26282/28840	50241m       Danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting	43.15871047973633
26283/28840	Danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his	142.3730010986328
26284/28840	He intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the	361.9719543457031
26285/28840	Danglars astonished opened the door but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled	46.25275421142578
26286/28840	Eh he said to the postilion eh _mio caro_   This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalc	278.4496154785156
26287/28840	Come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going   _Dentro la testa_ answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing	136.9970703125
26288/28840	Danglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant Put in your head He was making rapid progress in	629.6245727539062
26289/28840	His eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much	642.5950317382812

26291/28840	Danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the	31.227310180664062
26292/28840	Can I have been intercepted by French telegrams to the pontifical authorities   He resolved to end his	280.79937744140625

26294/28840	_Dentro la testa_ replied the same voice with the same menacing	708.9257202148438
26295/28840	Danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that	40.49996566772461
26296/28840	Decidedly said Danglars with the perspiration on his forehead I must be under	48.01969909667969
26297/28840	And he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to	129.21588134765625
26298/28840	He then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the	221.8389892578125
26299/28840	He understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to	169.3619384765625
26300/28840	Oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my	422.76513671875
26301/28840	The carriage continued to roll on with frightful	426.7425537109375
26302/28840	An hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road	313.6395263671875
26303/28840	At length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling	61.90785598754883
26304/28840	He remembered those interesting stories so little believed in Paris respecting Roman bandits he remembered the adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry Mademoiselle Eugé	81.69180297851562
26305/28840	Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel	4818.0537109375
26306/28840	On the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular	415.59820556640625
26307/28840	On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it	46.13430404663086
26308/28840	At the same time the door was	26.461240768432617
26309/28840	Danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak Italian he understood it very	116.84062957763672
26310/28840	More dead than alive he looked around	137.22994995117188
26311/28840	Four men surrounded him besides the post	464.898681640625
26312/28840	_Di quà_ said one of the men descending a little path leading out of the Appian	381.9962158203125
26313/28840	Danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following	62.75898742675781
26314/28840	Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentin	304.46319580078125
26315/28840	After walking for about ten minutes during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the	100.40383911132812
26316/28840	He wished to speak but his tongue refused to	105.0713119506836
26317/28840	_Avanti_ said the same sharp and imperative	866.2355346679688
26318/28840	This time Danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speakers meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the	191.01068115234375
26319/28840	This guide was our friend Peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open	781.0936889648438
26320/28840	Peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy	344.71142578125
26321/28840	The voice and gesture of the man who followed Danglars ordered him to do the	54.36067581176758
26322/28840	There was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditt	96.48098754882812
26323/28840	Danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by	236.11270141601562
26324/28840	Notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna he slid down like Peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his	225.4825897216797
26325/28840	As he touched the ground he opened his	38.681129455566406
26326/28840	50245m       The path was wide but	41.139041900634766
26327/28840	Peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a	264.5101013183594
26328/28840	Two other men descended after Danglars forming the rearguard and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two	294.5377502441406
26329/28840	The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the	124.40977478027344
26330/28840	A sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left	155.93882751464844
26331/28840	A friend a friend said Peppino but where is the captain   There said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched	129.33511352539062
26332/28840	Fine spoil captain fine spoil said Peppino in Italian and taking Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling	143.5266571044922
26333/28840	Is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading Plutarchs _Life of Alexander	818.348876953125
26334/28840	At this rather impertinent order Peppino raised his torch to the face of Danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes	129.4951171875
26335/28840	His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous	791.08251953125
26336/28840	The man is tired said the captain conduct him to his	127.58065032958984
26337/28840	Oh murmured Danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards I see glistening in the	91.09099578857422
26338/28840	The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor	233.08154296875
26339/28840	He no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led	1246.141357421875
26340/28840	At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six	62.365234375
26341/28840	Then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the	81.95336151123047
26342/28840	The cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the	3018.646240234375
26343/28840	A bed of dried grass covered with goatskins was placed in one	1086.6090087890625
26344/28840	Danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of	246.62025451660156
26345/28840	Oh God be praised he said it is a real bed   This was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of	123.23089599609375
26346/28840	He had not done so for ten years	47.873870849609375
26347/28840	_Ecco_ said the guide and pushing Danglars into the cell he closed the door upon	107.01886749267578
26348/28840	A bolt grated and Danglars was a	50.14506149291992
26349/28840	If there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of	51.56057357788086

26351/28840	These recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquill	75.71066284179688
26352/28840	Since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at	43.52713394165039
26353/28840	They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be rans	230.78244018554688
26354/28840	He remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his own price at 8000 crown	228.74343872070312
26355/28840	Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48000 livres he would then have about 5050000 francs	497.1474304199219
26356/28840	With this sum he could manage to keep out of	181.87933349609375

26358/28840	But in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into	591.533935546875
26359/28840	Yes yes he murmured I am in the hands of the brigands of whom Albert de Morcerf	34.01817321777344
26360/28840	His first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was	126.35629272460938
26361/28840	He borrowed this from _Don Quixote_ the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly	828.0158081054688
26362/28840	No he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his	101.6503677368164
26363/28840	They were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little notecase containing his letter of credit for 5050000 franc	446.2329406738281
26364/28840	Singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocket	337.18170166015625
26365/28840	As I was saying last night they intend me to be rans	876.6951293945312
26366/28840	Hello here is my watch Let me see what time it	92.9560546875
26367/28840	Danglars watch one of Breguets repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past	731.1505126953125
26368/28840	Without this Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his	61.0745849609375
26369/28840	Should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it The last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o	436.8414611816406
26370/28840	During all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his	50.82113265991211
26371/28840	50249m       Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over	29.715818405151367
26372/28840	Faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his	202.10374450683594
26373/28840	At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and Danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door	167.72813415527344
26374/28840	He was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and a flat nose his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his	1687.433349609375
26375/28840	But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting	1996.0054931640625
26376/28840	He got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his	50.030826568603516
26377/28840	Danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his	27.545791625976562
26378/28840	Danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goatskin and did not breathe another	190.97817993164062
26379/28840	Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another band	281.93792724609375
26380/28840	Danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his	149.00135803222656
26381/28840	It was indeed Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chickpeas stewed with	1152.0302734375
26382/28840	Near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a flask of Orviet	1787.08984375
26383/28840	Danglars watched these preparations and his mouth	67.34481811523438
26384/28840	Come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other and he tapped gently at the	89.96499633789062
26385/28840	_On y va_ coming exclaimed Peppino who from frequenting the house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its idi	1104.886962890625
26386/28840	Then he added aloud Yes sir I am hungryvery	350.03369140625
26387/28840	And your excellency wants something to eat   At once if possible   Nothing easier said Pepp	61.66691207885742
26388/28840	Here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest	1040.628173828125
26389/28840	Although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed	678.0928344726562
26390/28840	That is not the custom excellency said Pepp	45.705196380615234
26391/28840	A bad reason replied Danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but I am	222.44137573242188
26392/28840	Let me have some dinner   At once What would your excellency like   And Peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of Dangl	59.264320373535156
26393/28840	Have you kitchens here   Kitchensof coursecomplete	97302.8203125

26395/28840	You mentioned a fowl I think   Yes a f	103.08572387695312
26396/28840	Peppino turning around shouted A fowl for his excellency His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and halfnaked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his	309.0480041503906
26397/28840	I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris murmured Dangl	38.81804656982422
26398/28840	Here your excellency said Peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the wormeaten table which with the stool and the goatskin bed formed the entire furniture of the	144.65220642089844
26399/28840	Danglars asked for a knife and	143.6273651123047
26400/28840	Here excellency said Peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood	397.0412902832031
26401/28840	Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the f	48.37816619873047
26402/28840	Pardon me excellency said Peppino placing his hand on the bankers shoulder people pay here before they	92.13021087646484
26403/28840	They might not be satisfied and   Ah ha thought Danglars this is not so much like Paris except that I shall probably be skinned Never mind Ill fix that all	167.38946533203125
26404/28840	I have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy I should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at	422.56036376953125
26405/28840	There he said throwing a louis	180.9096221923828
26406/28840	Peppino picked up the louis and Danglars again prepared to carve the f	52.4616813659668
26407/28840	Stay a moment your excellency said Peppino rising you still owe me	61.033390045166016
26408/28840	I said they would skin me thought Danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said Come how much do I owe you for this fowl   Your excellency has given me a louis on	94.6465072631836
26409/28840	A louis on account for a fowl   Certainly and your excellency now owes me 4999 lou	205.39462280273438
26410/28840	Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic	91.28610229492188
26411/28840	Very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when Peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other	117.83858489990234
26412/28840	Is it not a joke said Dangl	32.58248519897461
26413/28840	We never joke replied Peppino solemn as a Qu	237.339599609375
26414/28840	Stay here is another louis for	134.46157836914062
26415/28840	Then that will make only 4998 louis more said Peppino with the same	647.5784301757812
26416/28840	I shall get them all in	98.98075103759766
26417/28840	Oh as for that said Danglars angry at this prolongation of the jestas for that you wont get them at	191.11463928222656
26418/28840	Go to the devil You do not know with whom you have to deal   50253m       Peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the f	70.9621353149414
26419/28840	Danglars threw himself upon his goatskin and Peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and	480.2198181152344
26420/28840	Though Danglars could not see Peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his	62.630584716796875
26421/28840	He was certainly eating and noisily too like an illbred	682.8313598632812
26422/28840	Peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat	163.622802734375
26423/28840	Danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another halfhour which appeared to him like a	102.07756042480469
26424/28840	He again arose and went to the	53.044456481933594
26425/28840	Come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they	192.08920288085938
26426/28840	Nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you	41.041202545166016
26427/28840	Give your orders and we will execute	156.03729248046875
26428/28840	Now look here I want something to eat To eatdo you hear   Are you hungry   Come you understand	99.81145477294922
26429/28840	What would your excellency like to eat   A piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed	99.98970031738281
26430/28840	Four thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight louis said Peppino You have paid two louis in	260.994140625
26431/28840	50255m       What One hundred thousand francs for a loaf   One hundred thousand francs repeated Pepp	30.251251220703125
26432/28840	But you only asked 100000 francs for a fowl   We have a fixed price for all our	122.41255187988281
26433/28840	It signifies nothing whether you eat much or littlewhether you have ten dishes or oneit is always the same	974.6813354492188
26434/28840	What still keeping up this silly jest My dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculousstupid You had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to	688.99267578125
26435/28840	Oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit	134.74354553222656
26436/28840	And what am I to pay with brute said Danglars	192.9339141845703
26437/28840	Do you suppose I carry 100000 francs in my pocket   Your excellency has 5050000 francs in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at 100000 francs apiece and half a fowl for the 5	74.78288269042969
26438/28840	The bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just	74.72460174560547
26439/28840	Come he said if I pay you the 100000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease   Certainly said Pepp	46.65437698364258
26440/28840	But how can I pay them   Oh nothing easier you have an account open with Mess	176.53163146972656
26441/28840	Thomson  French Via dei Banchi Rome give me a draft for 4998 louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take	980.304443359375
26442/28840	Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper Peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed	90.34976196289062
26443/28840	Here he said here is a draft at	206.63246154785156
26444/28840	Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had	153.20010375976562
26445/28840	As for Peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his	122.6883773803711
26446/28840	The Pardon   The next day Danglars was again hungry certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of	206.6298065185547
26447/28840	The prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his	158.59893798828125
26448/28840	But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten	114.48690795898438
26449/28840	He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called	178.3673095703125
26450/28840	The sentinel opened the door it was a new	70.66082000732422
26451/28840	He thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for Pepp	57.41865158081055
26452/28840	Here I am your excellency said Peppino with an eagerness which Danglars thought favorable to	36.928653717041016
26453/28840	What do you want   Something to	69.25942993164062
26454/28840	Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near	352.2515563964844
26455/28840	Then give me water cried Danglars endeavoring to parry the	65.06339263916016
26456/28840	Oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellencythere has been such a	278.5733947753906
26457/28840	Come thought Danglars it is the same old	48.824554443359375
26458/28840	And while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with pers	177.73387145996094
26459/28840	Come my friend said Danglars seeing that he made no impression on Peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine   I have already told you that we do not sell at	39.13827896118164
26460/28840	Well then let me have a bottle of the least	276.7241516113281
26461/28840	And what is that   Twentyfive thousand francs a	31.024717330932617
26462/28840	Tell me cried Danglars in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealingtell me that you wish to despoil me of all it will be sooner over than devouring me piece	818.2716064453125
26463/28840	It is possible such may be the masters	658.4500732421875
26464/28840	The masterwho is he   The person to whom you were conducted	130.75064086914062
26465/28840	And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Dangl	51.48100662231445
26466/28840	You sent for me he said to the	31.031484603881836
26467/28840	Are you sir the chief of the people who brought me here   Yes your excell	19.259729385375977
26468/28840	What then   How much do you require for my ransom   Merely the 5000000 you have about	106.25558471679688
26469/28840	Danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his	93.34008026123047
26470/28840	But this is all I have left in the world he said out of an immense	48.775272369384766
26471/28840	If you deprive me of that take away my life	185.1668243408203
26472/28840	We are forbidden to shed your	457.59552001953125
26473/28840	And by whom are you forbidden   By him we	456.908935546875
26474/28840	You do then obey someone   Yes a	190.60189819335938
26475/28840	I thought you said you were the chief   So I am of these men but there is another over	92.2936019897461
26476/28840	And did your superior order you to treat me in this way  	77.27029418945312
26477/28840	Come said Danglars will you take a million  	15.245434761047363
26478/28840	Two millionsthreefour Come four I will give them to you on condition that you let me	365.173828125
26479/28840	Why do you offer me 4000000 for what is worth 5000000 This is a kind of usury banker that I do not	454.6441345214844
26480/28840	Take all thentake all I tell you and kill me   Come come calm	272.4967041015625
26481/28840	You will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to	129.42269897460938
26482/28840	But when I have no more money left to pay you asked the infuriated Dangl	70.0748291015625
26483/28840	But you say you do not wish to kill me  	20.240293502807617
26484/28840	And yet you will let me perish with hunger   Ah that is a different	50.32683181762695
26485/28840	Danglars raving threw himself on the goats	155.85162353515625
26486/28840	Danglars meditated an escape but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually	414.6893615722656
26487/28840	His resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some	363.4300842285156
26488/28840	They sent him a magnificent supper and took his	678.2254638671875
26489/28840	From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he	160.75709533691406
26490/28840	At the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50000 francs	72.69967651367188
26491/28840	Three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not	2644.98876953125
26492/28840	Sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of	76.99859619140625
26493/28840	On the fourth he was no longer a man but a living	77.40050506591797
26494/28840	He had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his	213.5750732421875
26495/28840	Then he entreated Peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him 1000 francs for a mouthful of	217.77220153808594
26496/28840	On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the	62.201560974121094
26497/28840	Are you not a Christian he said falling on his	67.13068389892578
26498/28840	Do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of Heaven is a brother Oh my former friends my former friends he murmured and fell with his face to the	101.37068176269531
26499/28840	Yes those who have died of	72.24993133544922
26500/28840	Danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his	31.951171875
26501/28840	He struck his forehead on the ground and gro	69.23294830322266
26502/28840	Yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than I have but then they must have been martyrs at	83.53628540039062
26503/28840	Do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused Danglars hair to stand on	182.5112762451172
26504/28840	His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone	105.01226043701172
26505/28840	Of what must I repent stammered Dangl	89.52532958984375
26506/28840	Of the evil you have done said the	135.67095947265625
26507/28840	Oh yes oh yes I do indeed	561.7058715820312
26508/28840	And he struck his breast with his emaciated	1649.868896484375
26509/28840	Then I forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the	130.4119110107422
26510/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo said Danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and	64.22785186767578
26511/28840	You are mistakenI am not the Count of Monte Crist	13.989334106445312
26512/28840	Rise said the count your life is safe the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplicesone is mad the other	140.4915008544922
26513/28840	Keep the 50000 francs you have leftI give them to	49.662899017333984
26514/28840	The 5000000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown	1153.2086181640625
26515/28840	And now eat and drink I will entertain you	526.1018676757812
26516/28840	Vampa when this man is satisfied let him be	204.11073303222656
26517/28840	Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits	110.80963897705078
26518/28840	According to the counts directions Danglars was waited on by Vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of Italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the postchaise left him leaning against a	81.00495147705078
26519/28840	He remained there all night not knowing where he	120.40914154052734
26520/28840	When daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream he was thirsty and dragged himself towards	123.56987762451172
26521/28840	As he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely	86.83379364013672
26522/28840	The Fifth of October   It was about six oclock in the evening an opalcolored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue	281.6529235839844
26523/28840	The heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the	855.070556640625
26524/28840	A delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the Mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the	706.6438598632812
26525/28840	A light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles and from Tunis to	818.5311889648438
26526/28840	The vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the	369.8822326660156
26527/28840	It advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of	1024.943359375
26528/28840	The yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young	188.43881225585938
26529/28840	Standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a	109.82721710205078
26530/28840	Is that Monte Cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy	136.3961639404297
26531/28840	Yes your excellency said the captain we have reached	26.449880599975586
26532/28840	We have reached it repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable	65.34153747558594
26533/28840	Then he added in a low tone Yes that is the	231.09033203125
26534/28840	And then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by	110.45619201660156
26535/28840	A few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the	108.68224334716797
26536/28840	Your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself   What signal   The captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it	122.54570770263672
26537/28840	Ah yes he said as if awaking from a	147.7435760498047
26538/28840	The captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the	254.8123321533203
26539/28840	Ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little	114.16569519042969
26540/28840	The gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxsw	374.1423645019531
26541/28840	The traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms	204.1736297607422
26542/28840	The rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their	1549.2757568359375
26543/28840	50265m       Give way said the	34.9774055480957
26544/28840	The eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided	325.64337158203125
26545/28840	In an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine	466.2438049316406
26546/28840	Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men they will carry you ashore The young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat the sea immediately rose to his	99.74726867675781
26547/28840	Ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for	87.51689147949219
26548/28840	The young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm	564.6372680664062
26549/28840	Thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite	156.26947021484375
26550/28840	Yes you see I am as exact as you	45.508419036865234
26551/28840	But you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as Calypso said to Telem	3044.60009765625
26552/28840	Come I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and	119.32095336914062
26553/28840	Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a	71.8333740234375
26554/28840	Already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the	75.76892852783203
26555/28840	Oh yes said the count you are looking for the	39.138797760009766
26556/28840	Yes I paid them nothing and yet they are	141.94166564941406
26557/28840	Never mind that Maximilian said Monte Cristo	29.204504013061523
26558/28840	I have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all	225.06549072265625
26559/28840	Morrel looked at the count with	34.96318817138672
26560/28840	Count he said you are not the same here as in	48.5343017578125
26561/28840	How so   Here you	153.60308837890625
26562/28840	You are right to recall me to myself Maximilian he said I was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is	134.56907653808594
26563/28840	Oh no no count cried Maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to suff	373.4458312988281
26564/28840	Oh how charitable kind and good you are you affect this gayety to inspire me with	554.162353515625
26565/28840	You are wrong Morrel I was really	129.75521850585938
26566/28840	Then you forget me so much the	90.27293395996094
26567/28840	How so   Yes for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena He who is about to die salutes	175.22300720214844
26568/28840	Then you are not consoled asked the count	206.0653076171875
26569/28840	Oh exclaimed Morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that I could be   Listen said the	37.68857192993164
26570/28840	Do you understand the meaning of my words You cannot take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless	512.7965087890625
26571/28840	When I ask you if you are consoled I speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no	61.456703186035156
26572/28840	Well Morrel let us both examine the depths of your	100.15337371826172
26573/28840	Count said Morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth I come to die in the arms of a	81.70462036132812
26574/28840	Certainly there are people whom I	185.1847686767578
26575/28840	I love my sister JulieI love her husband Emmanuel but I require a strong mind to smile on my last	131.6145477294922
26576/28840	My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting I could not bear to see her	112.22242736816406
26577/28840	Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house with his	231.8979949951172
26578/28840	No I feel that I have reached the goal and I will go no	56.80651092529297
26579/28840	You told me to wait and hope do you know what you did unfortunate adviser I waited a month or rather I suffered for a month I did hope man is a poor wretched creature I did	222.35092163085938
26580/28840	What I cannot tellsomething wonderful an absurdity a miracleof what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call	1586.670166015625
26581/28840	Yes I did waityes I did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for	319.03619384765625
26582/28840	Oh count I shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of	474.37347412109375
26583/28840	Morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count	84.44432067871094
26584/28840	My friend continued Morrel you named the fifth of October as the end of the period of waitingtoday is the fifth of October he took out his watch it is now nine oclockI have yet three hours to	224.73785400390625
26585/28840	Be it so said the count	77.30305480957031
26586/28840	Morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived	102.57807922363281
26587/28840	He felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his	256.4711608886719
26588/28840	Morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he	420.7723083496094
26589/28840	As you please he said death is always deaththat is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from	833.3675537109375
26590/28840	He sat down and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to	30.815134048461914
26591/28840	They were in the marvellous diningroom before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and	186.0832061767578
26592/28840	Morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed	236.33290100097656
26593/28840	Let us talk like men he said looking at the	90.29703521728516
26594/28840	Go on   Count said Morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than	179.38206481933594
26595/28840	There is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome I have descended from a planet called	129.12232971191406
26596/28840	50269m       I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and I did live you told me to hope and I almost did	61.22810745239258
26597/28840	I am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die   Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tender	33.38692855834961
26598/28840	Yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for	999.1435546875
26599/28840	If you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a	383.1000061035156
26600/28840	Yes I know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand	86.44921112060547
26601/28840	You have spoken truly Maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the	551.1749267578125
26602/28840	And if you wished to die you would choose this death count  	86.93956756591797
26603/28840	Yes you have guessed rightly Morrel said the count that is what I	47.540889739990234
26604/28840	Thanks the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer is sweet to my	213.25755310058594
26605/28840	Do you then regret nothing   No replied Mor	52.37267303466797

26624/28840	He placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret	142.67929077148438
26625/28840	This box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the	281.0356750488281
26626/28840	It was a mixed mass of blue red and	472.0220947265625
26627/28840	The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to Morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon	106.91073608398438
26628/28840	It was then observable that the substance was green	1050.47314453125

26632/28840	What are you going to do my friend asked Morrel arresting his	42.25165557861328
26633/28840	Well the fact is Morrel I was thinking that I too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself   Stay said the young	81.48758697509766

26637/28840	And slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the counts hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by Monte Crist	269.93914794921875

26644/28840	At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging	153.93948364257812

26646/28840	A change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleid	1488.3206787109375

26772/28840	Now as a halfsmile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily	287.7850341796875
26773/28840	Nevertheless DArtagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed	91.79869079589844
26774/28840	He fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to fortyfive years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and wellshaped	272.9725341796875
26775/28840	He was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt	320.4825439453125

26777/28840	DArtagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future	88.738037109375
26778/28840	This time there could be no doubt DArtagnan was really	53.6419563293457
26779/28840	Unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious	227.750732421875
26780/28840	But I am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and	248.59397888183594

26787/28840	But DArtagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule	66.15666961669922
26788/28840	He drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying Turn turn Master Joker lest I strike you behind   Strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as	482.59796142578125

26829/28840	I should like however to know what this letter addressed to Tréville	150.52964782714844

26833/28840	In the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry reascended to his wifes chamber and found DArtagnan just recovering his	114.30040740966797
26834/28840	His interlocutor whose head appeared through the carriage window was a woman of from twenty to twoandtwenty	200.6720428466797
26835/28840	We have already observed with what rapidity DArtagnan seized the expression of a count	31.923826217651367
26836/28840	He perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which DArtagnan had hitherto	183.9405517578125

26844/28840	What without chastising this insolent boy asked the	741.242919921875
26845/28840	The stranger was about to reply but at the moment he opened his mouth DArtagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the	41.987998962402344
26846/28840	This insolent boy chastises others cried he and I hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as	290.57440185546875

26848/28840	No before a woman you would dare not fly I presume   Remember said Milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin	164.16868591308594

26853/28840	Base coward false gentleman cried DArtagnan springing forward in his turn after the	83.77310943603516
26854/28840	But his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exert	157.3353729248047
26855/28840	Yes a base coward murmured DArtagnan but sheshe was very	147.99057006835938
26856/28840	Milady faltered DArtagnan and fainted a second	60.61363220214844
26857/28840	Ah its all one said the host I have lost two customers but this one remains of whom I am pretty certain for some days to	176.76165771484375
26858/28840	It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in DArtagnans	131.12586975097656
26859/28840	The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his	301.9413146972656
26860/28840	Hence it resulted when DArtagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabb	155.6436004638672
26861/28840	As to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding	229.46401977539062
26862/28840	But this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly	436.54345703125
26863/28840	But after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter   Yes where is this letter cried DArtagn	42.93138885498047
26864/28840	In the first place I warn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find	32.13731002807617
26865/28840	His threat completed the intimidation of the	5311.63427734375
26866/28840	After the king and the cardinal	75.78868865966797
26867/28840	de Tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by	153.1825714111328

26869/28840	Throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost	735.92041015625
26870/28840	Does the letter contain anything valuable demanded the host after a few minutes of useless	1024.4210205078125
26871/28840	Zounds I think it does indeed cried the Gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at	136.63336181640625
26872/28840	It contained my fortune   Bills upon Spain asked the disturbed	2963.982177734375
26873/28840	Bills upon his Majestys private treasury answered DArtagnan who reckoning upon entering into the kings service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a	767.885009765625
26874/28840	The devil cried the host at his wits	262.1093444824219
26875/28840	But its of no importance continued DArtagnan with natural assurance its of no	412.1432189941406
26876/28840	The money is nothing that letter was	489.958984375
26877/28840	I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost	81.51863861083984

26879/28840	A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding	204.6446990966797
26880/28840	That letter is not lost cried	407.4927673339844
26881/28840	No it has been stolen from	171.52894592285156
26882/28840	Stolen By whom   By the gentleman who was here	108.6793441772461
26883/28840	He came down into the kitchen where your doublet	173.48451232910156
26884/28840	I would lay a wager he has stolen	137.83815002441406
26885/28840	Do you think so answered DArtagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cup	167.17129516601562
26886/28840	The fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this	347.9015808105469
26887/28840	Do you say resumed DArtagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman   I tell you I am sure of it continued the	30.759172439575195
26888/28840	I will complain to Monsieur de Tréville and Monsieur de Tréville will complain to the	16.12479019165039
26889/28840	He then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of	98.1893081665039
26890/28840	Antoine at Paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that DArtagnan had ridden him hard during the last	129.33486938476562
26891/28840	Thus the dealer to whom DArtagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his	78.78282165527344
26892/28840	Thus DArtagnan entered Paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his	198.99319458007812
26893/28840	This chamber was a sort of garret situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs near the	274.905517578125
26894/28840	dArtagnan and which she had given her son	66.95925903320312
26895/28840	Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the Louvre inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of	122.83759307861328

26904/28840	This was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth so that when the illustrious companion of the great Henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his	157.5889892578125
26905/28840	Thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it	488.8145751953125
26906/28840	de Tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that Louis	188.2316436767578
26907/28840	one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and Tréville nextor even perhaps before	197.2387237548828

26915/28840	On his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this	134.86231994628906

26924/28840	We learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these	495.4350280761719
26925/28840	Tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his	161.35643005371094

26964/28840	That great man who was so revered by DArtagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked	302.9427490234375

26979/28840	What would you have said the Musket	48.05384063720703

26982/28840	Ah Porthos cried one of his companions dont try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal	356.2681884765625
26983/28840	It was given to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday near the gate	336.0108337402344
26984/28840	No upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman I bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name Porth	116.45050811767578

26986/28840	Its true though said Porthos and the proof is that I paid twelve pistoles for	100.53074645996094
26987/28840	The wonder was increased though the doubt continued to	915.4306030273438
26988/28840	Is it not true Aramis said Porthos turning toward another Musket	94.63590240478516
26989/28840	This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of Aram	103.14256286621094
26990/28840	He was a stout man of about two or threeandtwenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn	357.5041809082031
26991/28840	His delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink	921.1066284179688

26993/28840	He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the	176.7039337158203

26995/28840	They continued to admire it but said no more about it and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another	315.0892028808594
26996/28840	What do you think of the story Chalaiss esquire relates asked another Musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to	416.541748046875
26997/28840	And what does he say asked Porthos in a selfsufficient	222.91578674316406
26998/28840	He relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort the _âme damnée_ of the cardinal disguised as a Capuchin and that this cursed Rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked Monsieur de Laigues like a ninny as he	641.517333984375
26999/28840	A ninny indeed said Porthos but is the matter certain   I had it from Aramis replied the Musket	126.89826965332031
27000/28840	Indeed   Why you knew it Porthos said Aram	19.538158416748047
27001/28840	Let us say no more about	73.18511962890625

27005/28840	Well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied Aramis	110.91668701171875

27014/28840	What is he waiting for asked	340.38897705078125

27057/28840	Well my Captain said Porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against	237.43421936035156
27058/28840	But we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and Athos grievously wounded was very little	258.42327880859375
27059/28840	Well Captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again	326.6572265625
27060/28840	And we did not surrenderno They dragged us away by	603.3757934570312

27091/28840	When all had gone out and the door was closed	73.4248046875
27092/28840	de Tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young	75.82779693603516
27093/28840	The event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his	205.8600616455078
27094/28840	He inquired what was the will of his persevering	287.0736999511719
27095/28840	DArtagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past	61.51510238647461
27096/28840	Pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but I had wholly forgotten	418.84716796875
27097/28840	But what help is there for it A captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary	192.92518615722656
27098/28840	Soldiers are big children but as I maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed   DArtagnan could not restrain a	75.2408218383789
27099/28840	de Tréville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the	142.5901336669922
27100/28840	I respected your father very much said	360.45263671875
27101/28840	What can I do for the son Tell me quickly my time is not my	128.79844665527344
27102/28840	It is indeed a favor young man replied	358.034912109375
27103/28840	de Tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to	66.58333587646484
27104/28840	But his majestys decision is always necessary and I inform you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than	370.653076171875
27105/28840	DArtagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the Musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of	728.6216430664062
27106/28840	de Tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as I have said I will do something for you young	110.69499206542969
27107/28840	Our recruits from Béarn are not generally very rich and I have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since I left the	319.4098815917969
27108/28840	I dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you   DArtagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said I ask alms of no	87.5240249633789
27109/28840	Oh thats very well young man continued	457.12725830078125
27110/28840	I know these airs I myself came to Paris with four crowns in my purse and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me I was not in a condition to purchase the Lou	96.95166015625
27111/28840	Thanks to the sale of his horse he commenced his career with four more crowns than	171.14788818359375
27112/28840	de Tréville possessed at the commencement of	73.80323791503906

27114/28840	I will write a letter today to the Director of the Royal Academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to	349.7825622558594
27115/28840	Our bestborn and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain	633.5828247070312
27116/28840	You will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and	3423.370849609375
27117/28840	You will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether I can be of further service to	92.64576721191406
27118/28840	DArtagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this	133.07330322265625
27119/28840	Alas sir said he I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to	145.2777862548828
27120/28840	de Tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor Béarn	566.591552734375
27121/28840	I had one sir and thank God such as I could wish cried DArtagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from	147.58860778808594
27122/28840	He then related the adventure of Meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted	460.77252197265625
27123/28840	This is all very strange said	190.3353271484375
27124/28840	de Tréville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud   Yes sir I certainly committed that imprudence but why should I have done otherwise A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my	139.90908813476562
27125/28840	Judge if I should not put myself under its	268.6158142089844
27126/28840	Flattery was at that period very current and	650.0125122070312
27127/28840	de Tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a	349.9176940917969
27128/28840	Was he not a finelooking man  	222.88368225097656
27129/28840	He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he	212.9889678955078
27130/28840	You know not the subject of their conversation   He gave her a box told her not to open it except in	115.5000991821289
27131/28840	Was this woman English   He called her Mil	352.0330810546875
27132/28840	It is he it must be he murmured Tré	77.35843658447266
27133/28840	Oh sir if you know who this man is cried DArtagnan tell me who he is and whence he	48.676029205322266
27134/28840	I will then release you from all your promiseseven that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers for before everything I wish to avenge	226.960205078125
27135/28840	If you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the	78.97222900390625
27136/28840	Do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like	429.3695068359375
27137/28840	That will not prevent me replied DArtagnan if ever I find	29.43488311767578
27138/28840	In the meantime said Tréville seek him notif I have a right to advise	236.74990844726562
27139/28840	All at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden	223.4755096435547
27140/28840	He was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected	381.4019775390625
27141/28840	I know he is a Gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for	61.16227722167969
27142/28840	The king and the cardinal are the best of friends their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive	558.535888671875
27143/28840	I am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by	314.8727722167969
27144/28840	Be assured that I am devoted to both these allpowerful masters and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king and also the cardinalone of the most illustrious geniuses that France has ever	179.85183715820312
27145/28840	Now young man regulate your conduct accordingly and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us	489.4730529785156
27146/28840	I will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my	622.24462890625
27147/28840	I hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend for you are the only young man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to	41.99465560913086
27148/28840	Tréville said to himself If the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failedhe who knows how bitterly I execrate himto tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at	482.3529968261719
27149/28840	Therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as I suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his Eminence in	176.09344482421875
27150/28840	DArtagnan answered with the greatest simplicity I came to Paris with exactly such	132.6822967529297
27151/28840	My father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourselfwhom he considered the first three personages in	340.1149597167969
27152/28840	de Tréville to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no	147.0211181640625
27153/28840	I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his	82.4144515991211
27154/28840	But I still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all	145.11141967773438
27155/28840	de Tréville was surprised to the greatest	87.49185180664062
27156/28840	So much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his	850.1719360351562
27157/28840	The more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive	119.23052978515625
27158/28840	Nevertheless he pressed DArtagnans hand and said to him You are an honest youth but at the present moment I can only do for you that which I just now	70.42185974121094
27159/28840	My hôtel will be always open to	218.67250061035156
27160/28840	Hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you	120.57806396484375
27161/28840	That is to say replied DArtagnan that you will wait until I have proved myself worthy of	34.43389892578125
27162/28840	Well be assured added he with the familiarity of a Gascon you shall not wait	114.74137115478516
27163/28840	And he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own	52.870582580566406
27164/28840	I promised you a letter for the director of the	72.6472396850586
27165/28840	de Tréville smiled at this flourish and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of	300.4662780761719
27166/28840	While he was doing this DArtagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the Musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they	134.7934112548828
27167/28840	de Tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to	59.517269134521484
27168/28840	But at the very moment when DArtagnan stretched out his hand to receive it	19.140464782714844
27169/28840	de Tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying Sblood he shall not escape me this time   And who asked	279.4793395996094
27170/28840	The devil take the madman murmured	121.94525146484375
27171/28840	de Trévilles private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a how	1060.302490234375
27172/28840	Excuse me said DArtagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but I am in a	35.80160140991211
27173/28840	Scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped	94.1177978515625
27174/28840	You are in a hurry said the Musketeer as pale as a	49.82530975341797
27175/28840	Under that pretense you run against me You say Excuse me and you believe that is sufficient Not at all my young	95.62605285644531
27176/28840	Do you fancy because you have heard Monsieur de Tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us Undeceive yourself comrade you are not Monsieur de Tré	69.37911224365234
27177/28840	My faith replied DArtagnan recognizing Athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own	117.33210754394531
27178/28840	I did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally I said Excuse	1322.986328125
27179/28840	It appears to me that this is quite	47.645111083984375
27180/28840	I repeat to you however and this time on my word of honorI think perhaps too oftenthat I am in haste great	237.45755004882812
27181/28840	Leave your hold then I beg of you and let me go where my business calls	119.5879898071289
27182/28840	Monsieur said Athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a	83.22373962402344
27183/28840	DArtagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at Athoss last remark he stopped	145.7711639404297
27184/28840	_Morbleu_ monsieur said he however far I may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners I warn	72.42211151123047
27185/28840	Ah If I were not in such haste and if I were not running after someone said DArtagn	40.126853942871094
27186/28840	Monsieur Maninahurry you can find me without running_me_ you understand   And where I pray you   Near the CarmesDesch	1064.7442626953125
27187/28840	At what hour   About	228.26107788085938
27188/28840	About noon That will do I will be	296.2760925292969
27189/28840	Endeavor not to make me wait for at quarter past twelve I will cut off your ears as you	166.1215057373047
27190/28840	Good cried DArtagnan I will be there ten minutes before	40.241050720214844
27191/28840	And he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him	235.66986083984375
27192/28840	But at the street gate Porthos was talking with the soldier on	105.26915740966797
27193/28840	Between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to	397.9546813964844
27194/28840	DArtagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between	43.625431060791016
27195/28840	But DArtagnan had reckoned without the	46.432552337646484
27196/28840	As he was about to pass the wind blew out Porthoss long cloak and DArtagnan rushed straight into the middle of	39.72185134887695
27197/28840	DArtagnan hearing the Musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of	107.65870666503906
27198/28840	He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of Porthosthat is to say exactly upon the bald	412.6430969238281
27199/28840	Alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff	483.5191345214844
27200/28840	Vainglorious as he was Porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least	487.159912109375
27201/28840	One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the	156.71690368652344
27202/28840	Bless me cried Porthos making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of DArtagnan who was wriggling about his back you must be mad to run against people in this	383.9125061035156
27203/28840	Excuse me said DArtagnan reappearing under the shoulder of the giant but I am in such hasteI was running after someone and   And do you always forget your eyes when you run asked Porth	70.3436279296875
27204/28840	No replied DArtagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes I can see what other people cannot	40.4424934387207
27205/28840	Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger Monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub Musketeers in this	178.00613403320312
27206/28840	Chastised Monsieur said DArtagnan the expression is	60.15412521362305
27207/28840	It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the	144.26722717285156
27208/28840	Ah _pardieu_ I know full well that you dont turn your back to	76.85099029541016
27209/28840	And the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing	797.0198974609375
27210/28840	Porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after DArtagn	60.44651794433594
27211/28840	Presently presently cried the latter when you havent your cloak	322.22003173828125
27212/28840	At one oclock then behind the	275.1809387207031
27213/28840	Very well at one oclock then replied DArtagnan turning the angle of the	39.14413833618164
27214/28840	But neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some	247.70452880859375
27215/28840	He began to reflect upon the events that had passed they were numerous and inausp	111.36939239501953
27216/28840	It was scarcely eleven oclock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with	59.56644058227539
27217/28840	de Tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which DArtagnan had left him a little caval	29.124267578125
27218/28840	Sure of being killed by Athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porth	46.25321578979492
27219/28840	The only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at	196.49478149414062
27220/28840	He had good cause to do so the pain I gave him must have been atro	250.6616668701172
27221/28840	As to Porthos that is certainly droll but I am not the less a giddy	101.26136016845703
27222/28840	Ah cursed Gascon that I am I get from one hobble into	383.96868896484375
27223/28840	Friend DArtagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance I would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the	144.2441864013672
27224/28840	You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of	553.1229858398438
27225/28840	To be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a	935.8671875
27226/28840	Look at Aramis now Aramis is mildness and grace person	855.5122680664062
27227/28840	Well did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a coward No certainly not and from this moment I will endeavor to model myself after	361.79473876953125
27228/28840	de Tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see	72.43800354003906
27229/28840	DArtagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious	155.75860595703125
27230/28840	All four besides immediately broke off their	1574.39013671875
27231/28840	He was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon	152.0022430419922
27232/28840	This appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his	123.75391387939453
27233/28840	Aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gas	89.82306671142578
27234/28840	He perceived his mistake but the friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young Musketeer with affected	409.380126953125
27235/28840	You make the demand badly replied Aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation I refuse it on account of the	513.0763549804688
27236/28840	The fact is hazarded DArtagnan timidly I did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aram	48.583133697509766
27237/28840	He had his foot upon it that is all and I thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was	114.41355895996094
27238/28840	And you were deceived my dear sir replied Aramis coldly very little sensible to the rep	116.5218276977539
27239/28840	No upon my honor cried his Majestys Guards	7799.9013671875
27240/28840	You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have	71.9617691040039
27241/28840	Now here Montaran we will do better than thatlet each take a	1611.409912109375
27242/28840	Perfectly just cried the other two Guardsmen the judgment of King Solomon Aramis you certainly are full of wisdom   The young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other	583.987060546875
27243/28840	In a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three Guardsmen and the Musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the Guardsmen going one way and Aramis	770.0414428710938
27244/28840	Ah monsieur interrupted Aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man	50.858673095703125
27245/28840	What the devil Paris is not paved with cambric   Monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said DArtagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific	489.2776794433594
27246/28840	Monsieur what I say to you about the matter said Aramis is not for the sake of seeking a	44.6170539855957
27247/28840	Thank God I am not a bravo And being a Musketeer but for a time I only fight when I am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by	123.99633026123047
27248/28840	Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief   Why did you so awkwardly let it fall   I have said monsieur and I repeat that the handkerchief did not fall from my	127.0955581665039
27249/28840	And thereby you have lied twice monsieur for I saw it	179.582763671875
27250/28840	Ah you take it with that tone do you Master Gascon Well I will teach you how to behave	273.61761474609375
27251/28840	And I will send you back to your Mass book Master Abb	613.8626708984375
27252/28840	Draw if you please and instantly   Not so if you please my good friendnot here at	79.71281433105469
27253/28840	I wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to	163.27542114257812
27254/28840	I agree monsieur but do not be too	130.89828491210938
27255/28840	Take your handkerchief whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of	89.09248352050781
27256/28840	At two oclock I shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of Monsieur de Tré	24.661195755004883
27257/28840	There I will indicate to you the best place and	235.5977325439453
27258/28840	THE KINGS MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINALS GUARDS     DArtagnan was acquainted with nobody in	105610.234375
27259/28840	He went therefore to his appointment with Athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should	185.4229736328125
27260/28840	He reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more	75.55689239501953
27261/28840	He hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of Athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him	483.8163757324219
27262/28840	He flattered himself he should be able to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover Porthos with	219.18841552734375
27263/28840	In addition to this DArtagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart Endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and Monsieur de Tré	134.61990356445312
27264/28840	When DArtagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery Athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve oclock was	123.96707153320312
27265/28840	He was then as punctual as the Samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to	631.1690063476562
27266/28840	Athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by	826.0845947265625
27267/28840	de Trévilles surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the	469.3548278808594
27268/28840	Monsieur said Athos I have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which I am astonished as it is not at all their	68.34160614013672
27269/28840	You know no one but Monsieur de Tréville he	19.991443634033203
27270/28840	Well but then continued Athos speaking half to himself if I kill you I shall have the air of a boys	362.5070495605469
27271/28840	Not too much so replied DArtagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very	125.0243911743164
27272/28840	Very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly I can tell	956.0946044921875
27273/28840	But I will take the left handit is my custom in such	89.568115234375
27274/28840	Do not fancy that I do you a favor I use either hand	1049.884765625
27275/28840	And it will be even a disadvantage to you a lefthanded man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for	394.2974548339844
27276/28840	I regret I did not inform you sooner of this	164.57679748535156
27277/28840	You have truly monsieur said DArtagnan bowing again a courtesy for which I assure you I am very	36.532142639160156
27278/28840	You confuse me replied Athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you	112.76236724853516
27279/28840	Ah sblood how you have hurt me My shoulder quite	3073.018310546875
27280/28840	If you would permit me said DArtagnan with tim	29.03840446472168
27281/28840	What monsieur   I have a miraculous balsam for woundsa balsam given to me by my mother and of which I have made a trial upon	121.35676574707031
27282/28840	Well   Well I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you and at the end of three days when you would be curedwell sir it would still do me a great honor to be your	110.51166534423828
27283/28840	DArtagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his	137.00216674804688
27284/28840	_Pardieu_ monsieur said Athos thats a proposition that pleases me not that I can accept it but a league off it savors of the	75.7955551147461
27285/28840	Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of Charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his	236.43502807617188
27286/28840	Unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known I say that we were to fight and our combat would be	104.2675552368164
27287/28840	I think these fellows will never	261.79547119140625
27288/28840	There is another word which pleases me cried Athos with a gracious nod to DArtagn	58.74824523925781
27289/28840	That did not come from a man without a	64.59091186523438
27290/28840	Monsieur I love men of your kidney and I foresee plainly that if we dont kill each other I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your	226.72633361816406
27291/28840	We will wait for these gentlemen so please you I have plenty of time and it will be more	105.4906997680664
27292/28840	Ah here is one of them I	49.87295913696289
27293/28840	In fact at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos	50.000274658203125
27294/28840	What cried DArtagnan is your first witness Monsieur Porthos   Yes that disturbs you   By no	66.21514892578125
27295/28840	DArtagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos and perceived Aram	37.803707122802734
27296/28840	It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said Ath	55.05741882324219
27297/28840	My faith replied DArtagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon	241.68429565429688
27298/28840	In the meantime Porthos had come up waved his hand to Athos and then turning toward DArtagnan stood quite	45.87454605102539
27299/28840	Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his	340.4623718261719
27300/28840	Ah ah said he what does this mean   This is the gentleman I am going to fight with said Athos pointing to DArtagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same	27.66693878173828
27301/28840	Why it is with him I am also going to fight said Porth	31.873632431030273
27302/28840	But not before one oclock replied DArtagn	28.346149444580078
27303/28840	And I also am to fight with this gentleman said Aramis coming in his turn onto the	165.73580932617188
27304/28840	But not until two oclock said DArtagnan with the same calm	19.488374710083008
27305/28840	But what are you going to fight about Athos asked Aram	27.771163940429688
27306/28840	And you Porthos   Faith I am going to fightbecause I am going to fight answered Porthos redd	50.60703659057617
27307/28840	Athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied We had a short discussion upon	580.4783325195312
27308/28840	Oh ours is a theological quarrel replied Aramis making a sign to DArtagnan to keep secret the cause of their	138.94454956054688
27309/28840	Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of DArtagn	57.351478576660156
27310/28840	Augustine upon which we could not agree said the Gas	84.63309478759766
27311/28840	Decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured Ath	73.79999542236328
27312/28840	And now you are assembled gentlemen said DArtagnan permit me to offer you my	63.04182052612305
27313/28840	At this word _apologies_ a cloud passed over the brow of Athos a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos and a negative sign was the reply of Aram	125.1961441040039
27314/28840	You do not understand me gentlemen said DArtagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the	50.995670318603516
27315/28840	And now gentlemen I repeat excuse me but on that account only andon guard   At these words with the most gallant air possible DArtagnan drew his	120.28845977783203
27316/28840	The blood had mounted to the head of DArtagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against Athos Porthos and Aram	34.26741027832031
27317/28840	The sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ard	398.2331848144531
27318/28840	That is true Monsieur replied DArtagnan and whether drawn by myself or another I assure you I shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a	72.73639678955078
27319/28840	I will therefore fight in my doublet like	116.47305297851562
27320/28840	Come come enough of such compliments cried Porth	222.1009521484375
27321/28840	Remember we are waiting for our	269.38543701171875
27322/28840	Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted Aram	272.88092041015625
27323/28840	For my part I think what they say is very well said and quite worthy of two	92.40447998046875
27324/28840	When you please monsieur said Athos putting himself on	25.27463150024414
27325/28840	I waited your orders said DArtagnan crossing	137.08143615722656
27326/28840	But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the Guards of his Eminence commanded by	873.2734375
27327/28840	de Jussac turned the corner of the	305.6494445800781
27328/28840	The cardinals Guards cried Aramis and Porthos at the same	59.38870620727539
27329/28840	Sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords   But it was too	127.18728637695312
27330/28840	The two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their	141.44931030273438
27331/28840	If we were to see you fighting I can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent	53.66425323486328
27332/28840	Leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to	602.9605102539062
27333/28840	Gentlemen said Jussac it is with great regret that I pronounce the thing	579.2177734375
27334/28840	Sheathe then if you please and follow	126.39063262939453
27335/28840	Monsieur said Aramis parodying Jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves but unfortunately the thing is impossibleMonsieur de Tréville has forbidden	170.47666931152344
27336/28840	Pass on your way then it is the best thing to	54.72453689575195
27337/28840	We will charge upon you then said he if you disob	148.56524658203125
27338/28840	There are five of them said Athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a conquered	152.94309997558594
27339/28840	Athos Porthos and Aramis instantly drew near one another while Jussac drew up his	113.60289001464844
27340/28840	This short interval was sufficient to determine DArtagnan on the part he was to	105.11300659179688
27341/28840	It was one of those events which decide the life of a man it was a choice between the king and the cardinalthe choice made it must be persisted	98.03389739990234
27342/28840	To fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king	136.99380493164062
27343/28840	All this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a	270.3666687011719
27344/28840	Turning towards Athos and his friends Gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you	58.76231002807617
27345/28840	You said you were but three but it appears to me we are	79.1778793334961
27346/28840	But you are not one of us said Porth	16.62356185913086
27347/28840	Thats true replied DArtagnan I have not the uniform but I have the	68.83116149902344
27348/28840	My heart is that of a Musketeer I feel it monsieur and that impels me	64.99848937988281
27349/28840	Withdraw young man cried Jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed DArtagnans	347.19525146484375
27350/28840	You may retire we consent to	227.34103393554688
27351/28840	Decidedly you are a brave fellow said Athos pressing the young mans	43.30321502685547
27352/28840	Come come choose your part replied Juss	4789.1796875
27353/28840	Well said Porthos to Aramis we must do	21.430692672729492
27354/28840	Monsieur is full of generosity said Ath	94.32230377197266
27355/28840	But all three reflected upon the youth of DArtagnan and dreaded his inexper	666.7935791015625
27356/28840	We should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed Athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four	84.51195526123047
27357/28840	Try me gentlemen said he and I swear to you by my honor that I will not go hence if we are	64.53494262695312
27358/28840	What is your name my brave fellow said Ath	44.57695770263672
27359/28840	Well then Athos Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan forward cried Ath	23.82195472717285
27360/28840	Come gentlemen have you decided cried Jussac for the third	571.65380859375
27361/28840	And what is your choice asked Juss	686.7504272460938
27362/28840	We are about to have the honor of charging you replied Aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the	61.82162857055664
27363/28840	Ah You resist do you cried Juss	1587.739501953125
27364/28840	Sblood does that astonish you   And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of	295.170166015625
27365/28840	Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac a favorite of the card	803.9568481445312
27366/28840	Porthos had Bicarat and Aramis found himself opposed to two	509.86895751953125
27367/28840	As to DArtagnan he sprang toward Jussac	105.49834442138672
27368/28840	This contest at length exhausted Jussacs	2624.183837890625
27369/28840	Furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make	410.4710388183594
27370/28840	DArtagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his	150.5558624267578
27371/28840	Jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while Jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his	265.2178649902344
27372/28840	DArtagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of	38.718746185302734
27373/28840	Aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warm	119.5965347290039
27374/28840	Nevertheless Aramis was in a good situation and able to defend	68.59040832519531
27375/28840	Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterh	384.83404541015625
27376/28840	Porthos had received a thrust through his arm and Bicarat one through his	417.9005432128906
27377/28840	But neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnest	234.94110107421875
27378/28840	Athos wounded anew by Cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a	1511.6890869140625
27379/28840	He only changed his sword hand and fought with his left	167.52752685546875
27380/28840	According to the laws of dueling at that period DArtagnan was at liberty to assist whom he	113.37684631347656
27381/28840	While he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from Ath	126.32882690429688
27382/28840	Athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask	342.5282897949219
27383/28840	DArtagnan interpreted it with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of Cahusac crying To me Monsieur Guardsman I will slay you   Cahusac	888.6436157226562
27384/28840	It was time for Athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his	214.08457946777344
27385/28840	Sblood cried he to DArtagnan do not kill him young man I beg of	48.91392135620117
27386/28840	I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and sound	166.40423583984375
27387/28840	Disarm him onlymake sure of his	3538.503662109375
27388/28840	Thats it Very well done   The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly twenty paces from	205.00381469726562
27389/28840	DArtagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but DArtagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon	116.13613891601562
27390/28840	DArtagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes Cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his	152.5774383544922
27391/28840	At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for	115.53055572509766
27392/28840	There only then remained Porthos and Bic	864.60546875
27393/28840	Porthos made a thousand flourishes asking Bicarat what oclock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brothers having just obtained a company in the regiment of Navarre but jest as he might he gained	853.4989624023438
27394/28840	Bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell	325.34429931640625
27395/28840	The watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinal	637.7779541015625
27396/28840	Athos Aramis and DArtagnan surrounded Bicarat and required him to	257.93011474609375
27397/28840	Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh Bicarat wished to hold out but Jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to	384.85150146484375
27398/28840	But there are four against you leave off I command	203.2000274658203
27399/28840	Ah if you command me thats another thing said Bic	526.7012329101562
27400/28840	As you are my commander it is my duty to	75.45161437988281
27401/28840	And springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist	300.4324645996094
27402/28840	Bravery is always respected even in an	544.985595703125
27403/28840	The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with their swords and returned them to their she	964.684326171875
27404/28840	Then assisted by Bicarat the only one left standing they bore Jussac Cahusac and one of Aramiss adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the	895.0732421875
27405/28840	The fourth as we have said was	187.8365936279297
27406/28840	They then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of	270.5182189941406
27407/28840	They walked arm in arm occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every Musketeer they met so that in the end it became a triumphal	229.55494689941406
27408/28840	The heart of DArtagnan swam in delirium he marched between Athos and Porthos pressing them tender	51.829952239990234
27409/28840	If I am not yet a Musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of	46.14555740356445
27410/28840	de Tréville scolded his Musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king	400.81756591796875
27411/28840	de Tréville hastened to report himself at the Lou	54.365379333496094
27412/28840	The king was closeted with the cardinal and	388.2323913574219
27413/28840	de Tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that	55.80036926269531
27414/28840	de Tréville attended the kings gaming	1565.776611328125
27415/28840	The king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent	258.85638427734375
27416/28840	de Tréville at a distance   Come here Monsieur Captain said he come here that I may growl at	101.75942993164062
27417/28840	Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints against your Musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his Eminence is indisposed Ah these Musketeers of yours are very devilsfellows to be	277.6152038574219
27418/28840	No sire replied Tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire Ill be their	351.4301452636719
27419/28840	And that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majestys	79.38978576660156
27420/28840	But what are they to do The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend	217.3031463623047
27421/28840	But dont fancy that I am going to take you on your bare	128.31356811523438
27422/28840	I am called Louis the Just Monsieur de Tréville and by and by by and by we will	163.2526092529297
27423/28840	Ah sire it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your	100.0052490234375
27424/28840	Wait then monsieur wait said the king I will not detain you	43.353004455566406
27425/28840	In fact fortune changed and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagneif we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our	353.27899169921875
27426/28840	Ah I had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain	126.4586410522461
27427/28840	de Tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window Well monsieur continued he you say it is his Eminences Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers   Yes sire as they always	79.34402465820312
27428/28840	And how did the thing happen Let us see for you know my dear Captain a judge must hear both	374.89080810546875
27429/28840	Good Lord In the most simple and natural manner	570.91015625
27430/28840	The party was to take place at	124.36860656738281
27431/28840	Ah ah You incline me to think so said the	114.90106964111328
27432/28840	There is no doubt they went thither to fight	176.53565979003906
27433/28840	I do not accuse them sire but I leave your Majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carm	184.9373321533203
27434/28840	Yes Tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in France two heads to	133.44375610351562
27435/28840	But all this will come to an end Tréville will come to an	104.46492767333984
27436/28840	You say then that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the Musketeers   I say that it is probable that things have fallen out so but I will not swear to it s	104.4890365600586
27437/28840	You know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes Louis	191.88084411621094
27438/28840	to be named the Just   You are right Tréville but they were not alone your Musket	113.80523681640625
27439/28840	Why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory   Yes sire as complete as that of the Bridge of	327.26898193359375
27440/28840	Four men one of them wounded and a youth say you   One hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to your	227.7549591064453
27441/28840	How does he call himself   DArtagnan sire he is the son of one of my oldest friendsthe son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil	64.23848724365234
27442/28840	And you say this young man behaved himself well Tell me how Trévilleyou know how I delight in accounts of war and	1734.8699951171875
27443/28840	twisted his mustache proudly placing his hand upon his	4123.85205078125
27444/28840	Sire resumed Tréville as I told you Monsieur dArtagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer he was dressed as a	42.792850494384766
27445/28840	The Guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they	170.82029724121094
27446/28840	So you may plainly see Tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked   That is true sire there can be no more doubt on that	115.20950317382812
27447/28840	They called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a Musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your Majesty and that therefore he would remain with Messieurs the Musket	161.16819763183594
27448/28840	Well he did remain with them and your Majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so	741.2008056640625
27449/28840	He who wounded Jussac cried the king he a boy Tréville thats impossible   It is as I have the honor to relate it to your	169.58595275878906
27450/28840	Jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom   Well sire for once he found his	126.13843536376953
27451/28840	I will see this young man TrévilleI will see him and if anything can be donewell we will make it our	127.25631713867188
27452/28840	When will your Majesty deign to receive him   Tomorrow at midday Tré	209.70718383789062
27453/28840	Shall I bring him alone   No bring me all four	112.22510528564453
27454/28840	I wish to thank them all at	65.56893920898438
27455/28840	Devoted men are so rare Tréville by the back	288.8543701171875
27456/28840	It is useless to let the cardinal	118.13219451904297
27457/28840	You understand Trévillean edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after	309.0926818847656
27458/28840	But this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a	214.85525512695312
27459/28840	It is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinals Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur dArtagn	170.93478393554688
27460/28840	That is true said the king but never mind Tréville come still by the back	124.57141876220703
27461/28840	Tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of	215.93359375
27462/28840	That evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded	146.4535369873047
27463/28840	As they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but DArtagnan with his Gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden	87.12869262695312
27464/28840	By eight oclock in the morning he was at the apartment of Ath	17.8132266998291
27465/28840	DArtagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go	44.90068817138672
27466/28840	As the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the	68.77686309814453
27467/28840	Athos invited DArtagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine oclock in the morning as it then scarcely was till	93.40357208251953
27468/28840	The two Musketeers were already there and were playing	140.793701171875
27469/28840	DArtagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without	152.3134307861328
27470/28840	Unfortunately for DArtagnan among the spectators was one of his Eminences Guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging	143.076416015625
27471/28840	He believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor It is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a Musketeer	195.95751953125
27472/28840	DArtagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent	149.71160888671875
27473/28840	_Pardieu_ resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman I have said what I have	113.18898010253906
27474/28840	And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied DArtagnan in a low voice I beg you to follow	46.38634490966797
27475/28840	And when asked the Guardsman with the same jeering	1051.7742919921875
27476/28840	And you know who I am without doubt   I I am completely ignorant nor does it much disquiet	143.8484649658203
27477/28840	Youre in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so	145.58123779296875
27478/28840	What is your name   Bernajoux at your	371.7319030761719
27479/28840	Well then Monsieur Bernajoux said DArtagnan tranquilly I will wait for you at the	63.31657409667969
27480/28840	Do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out	168.05726623535156
27481/28840	You must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the	120.93028259277344
27482/28840	Thats true said the Guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young	488.1474609375
27483/28840	Indeed the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world DArtagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not rep	185.6776123046875
27484/28840	Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game and Athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the Guardsman of his Eminence stopped outside the	106.75041961669922
27485/28840	An instant after the Guardsman descended in his	1190.5809326171875
27486/28840	Never mind be content I will do my	422.4363098144531
27487/28840	On guard   But said he whom DArtagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the Abbey	151.45989990234375
27488/28840	What you say is full of sense replied DArtagnan but unfortunately I have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve	90.03202819824219
27489/28840	On guard then monsieur on guard   Bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him	293.0627136230469
27490/28840	In an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to	233.23753356933594
27491/28840	But DArtagnan had on the preceding day served his apprentices	76.04610443115234
27492/28840	Fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a	486.6709289550781
27493/28840	He freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the	463.7442626953125
27494/28840	DArtagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon DArtagnans	286.9825744628906
27495/28840	As however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of	208.7583770751953
27496/28840	But Athos Porthos and Aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them	125.16027069091797
27497/28840	Thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the Red Duke as Aramis had called him often took part with the kings Musketeers in these quarrel	310.6969909667969
27498/28840	Of three Guardsmen of the company of	868.7998657226562
27499/28840	Dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel of	208.14599609375
27500/28840	de Tréville crying To the rescue Musketeers To the rescue As usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their	212.40965270996094
27501/28840	The _mêlée_ became general but strength was on the side of the Musket	138.87744140625
27502/28840	de la Trémouilles people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with	293.30242919921875
27503/28840	As to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad	41.909149169921875
27504/28840	Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of	249.56719970703125
27505/28840	de la Trémouilles domestics in daring to make a _sortie_ upon the kings Musket	899.6744384765625
27506/28840	The proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven oclock	224.24266052246094
27507/28840	DArtagnan and his companions remembered their audience and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too	181.45069885253906
27508/28840	Besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of	164.5123748779297
27509/28840	de Tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh	100.06654357910156
27510/28840	Quick to the Louvre said he to the Louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the	43.238365173339844
27511/28840	We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the affair of yesterday and the two will pass off	135.75270080566406
27512/28840	de Tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the Louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the Musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of	83.56078338623047
27513/28840	de Tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become	344.3124084472656
27514/28840	Had his Majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday   No your Excellency replied the valet de chambre the Master of the Hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a	199.58883666992188
27515/28840	At first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after	86.47992706298828
27516/28840	And the king has seen the cardinal asked	186.9192352294922
27517/28840	In all probability he has replied the valet for I saw the horses harnessed to his Eminences carriage this morning and when I asked where he was going they told me To	156.74986267089844
27518/28840	He is beforehand with us said	234.49844360351562
27519/28840	Gentlemen I will see the king this evening but as to you I do not advise you to risk doing	121.90484619140625
27520/28840	This advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute	131.80654907226562
27521/28840	de Tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for	257.2261962890625
27522/28840	de Tréville thought it best to be first in making the	316.5719909667969
27523/28840	He sent one of his servants to	102.65162658691406
27524/28840	de la Trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinals Guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making _sortie_ against the kings Musket	790.5380249023438
27525/28840	de la Trémouillealready prejudiced by his esquire whose relative as we already know Bernajoux wasreplied that it was neither for	5009.0908203125
27526/28840	de Tréville nor the Musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to	162.51156616210938
27527/28840	Now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion	724.623291015625
27528/28840	de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it	552.302001953125
27529/28840	This was to go himself to	171.7804718017578
27530/28840	He repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be	383.6239013671875
27531/28840	The two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least	420.2910461425781
27532/28840	Both were men of courage and honor and as	298.0052795410156
27533/28840	de la Trémouillea Protestant and seeing the king seldomwas of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social	2099.120849609375
27534/28840	This time however his address although polite was cooler than	8423.1669921875
27535/28840	de Tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and I am come to endeavor to clear up this	87.8748779296875
27536/28840	de la Trémouille but I warn you that I am well informed and all the fault is with your Musket	169.31704711914062
27537/28840	You are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said Tréville not to accept the proposal I am about to make to	87.85150146484375
27538/28840	How is Monsieur Bernajoux your esquires relative   Why monsieur very ill indeed In addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad	405.4947204589844
27539/28840	But has the wounded man retained his senses   Perfect	104.22962951660156
27540/28840	Does he talk   With difficulty but he can	503.42059326171875
27541/28840	Well monsieur let us go to	16.580392837524414
27542/28840	Let us adjure him in the name of the God before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the	192.1255645751953
27543/28840	I will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will	63.48368835449219
27544/28840	de la Trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to	296.5525817871094
27545/28840	Both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man	33.6046257019043
27546/28840	The latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost	109.56693267822266
27547/28840	de la Trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to	373.3779602050781
27548/28840	de Tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested	116.91040802001953
27549/28840	de la Trémouille to interrogate him	797.5901489257812
27550/28840	Placed between life and death as Bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had	245.87509155273438
27551/28840	He wished Bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of	14901.1796875
27552/28840	de la Trémouille returned to his hôtel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at	330.78240966796875
27553/28840	de Tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist	53650.9765625
27554/28840	It may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminences Guardsmen had	1078.9490966796875
27555/28840	The king had not yet returned from	429.7314147949219
27556/28840	Our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his Majesty was	107.67184448242188
27557/28840	At his announcement DArtagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his	63.897972106933594
27558/28840	The coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his	295.6341552734375
27559/28840	His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must	102.21685791015625
27560/28840	He was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his	281.66204833984375
27561/28840	At the first glance DArtagnan judged that the mind of the king was storm	95.10814666748047
27562/28840	This disposition visible as it was in his Majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his	789.6560668945312
27563/28840	In royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at	107.52725982666016
27564/28840	The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step	105.28034210205078
27565/28840	DArtagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew Athos Porthos and Aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or lookingindeed as if he had never seen them	58.294647216796875
27566/28840	de Tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his Majesty grumbling entered his	95.12165832519531
27567/28840	Matters go but badly said Athos smiling and we shall not be made Chevaliers of the Order this	143.878173828125
27568/28840	de Tréville and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me	54.719215393066406
27569/28840	The four young men waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour twenty minutes and seeing that	94.78890991210938
27570/28840	de Tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to	112.52383422851562
27571/28840	de Tréville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his Majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his	185.79612731933594
27572/28840	This however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his Majestys	473.4112854003906
27573/28840	Bad monsieur bad replied the king I am	47.056888580322266
27574/28840	This was in fact the worst complaint of Louis	132.6803436279297
27575/28840	who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say Monsieur Soandso let us weary ourselves	290.8418273925781
27576/28840	How Your Majesty is bored Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today   A fine pleasure indeed monsieur Upon my soul everything degenerates and I dont know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no	290.53509521484375
27577/28840	We started a stag of ten	2212.009765625
27578/28840	We chased him for six hours and when he was near being takenwhen	365.8830261230469

27580/28840	I shall be obliged to give up hunting as I have given up haw	594.7794799804688
27581/28840	Ah I am an unfortunate king Monsieur de Tréville I had but one gerfalcon and he died day before	186.03370666503906
27582/28840	Indeed sire I wholly comprehend your	1286.5045166015625
27583/28840	The misfortune is great but I think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercel	3509.4638671875
27584/28840	And not a man to instruct	153.20339965820312

27587/28840	He knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a prefacea sort of excitation to encourage himselfand that he had now come to his point at	133.54261779785156
27588/28840	And in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty asked	207.77700805664062
27589/28840	de Tréville feigning the most profound aston	95.44924926757812
27590/28840	Is it thus you perform your charge monsieur continued the king without directly replying to de Trévilles	405.1769714355469
27591/28840	de Tréville calmly on the contrary I come to demand it of	74.13712310791016
27592/28840	Ah This is something new replied the	184.935546875
27593/28840	Tell me now can you deny all this   And who told you this fine story sire asked Tréville	133.7886505126953
27594/28840	Who has told me this fine story monsieur Who should it be but he who watches while I sleep who labors while I amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroadin France as in Europe   Your Majesty probably refers to God said	443.32733154296875
27595/28840	de Tréville for I know no one except God who can be so far above your	99.4063491821289

27599/28840	You mean to say that he deceives me you mean to say that he betrays me You accuse him then Come speak avow freely that you accuse him   No sire but I say that he deceives	82.11577606201172
27600/28840	I say that he has hastily accused your Majestys Musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good	392.0522155761719
27601/28840	The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Trémouille from the duke	139.6129913330078

27607/28840	La Chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find Monsieur de la Trémouille I wish to speak with him this	264.40582275390625
27608/28840	Your Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between Monsieur de la Trémouille and myself   Nobody by the faith of a	169.95225524902344

27617/28840	Till then God preserve your Majesty   However ill the king might sleep	838.3013305664062
27618/28840	He had ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the	97.57792663574219
27619/28840	He took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the	396.0642395019531
27620/28840	Arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to	107.18172454833984
27621/28840	If the king was still irritated against them they would depart without being seen if the king consented to see them they would only have to be	86.0013427734375
27622/28840	On arriving at the kings private antechamber	109.66278839111328
27623/28840	de Tréville found La Chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find	529.9073486328125
27624/28840	de la Trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the Louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the	119.23358917236328
27625/28840	de Tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between	573.665771484375
27626/28840	In fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the kings closet opened and	129.9671630859375
27627/28840	The duke came straight up to him and said Monsieur de Tréville his Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hô	89.52886962890625
27628/28840	I have told him the truth that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that I was ready to offer you my	50.91545486450195
27629/28840	Since I have the good fortune to meet you I beg you to receive them and to hold me always as one of your	45.108497619628906
27630/28840	de Tréville I was so confident of your loyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than	1010.1665649414062
27631/28840	I find that I have not been mistaken and I thank you that there is still one man in France of whom may be said without disappointment what I have said of	65.79083251953125
27632/28840	Tell him all this for me for these are things which a king cannot say for	261.4537658691406

27634/28840	Ah You have heard what I said So much the better Duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the	68.41027069091797
27635/28840	Where are your Musketeers I told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you why have you not done so   They are below sire and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid them come	232.5868377685547
27636/28840	Yes yes let them come up	167.77877807617188
27637/28840	It is nearly eight oclock and at nine I expect a	156.44578552246094
27638/28840	At the moment he opened the door the three Musketeers and DArtagnan conducted by La Chesnaye appeared at the top of the	140.35678100585938
27639/28840	Come in my braves said the king come in I am going to scold	126.3229751586914
27640/28840	The Musketeers advanced bowing DArtagnan following closely behind	111.50930786132812
27641/28840	One now and then I dont say much about but seven in two days I repeat it is too many it is far too many   Therefore sire your Majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their	274.5711669921875
27642/28840	Quite contrite and repentant Hem said the	3360.828125
27643/28840	I place no confidence in their hypocritical	779.5093994140625
27644/28840	In particular there is one yonder of a Gascon	139.46493530273438
27645/28840	DArtagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating	188.55621337890625
27646/28840	Why you told me he was a young man This is a boy Tréville a mere boy Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at Jussac   And those two equally fine thrusts at Bernaj	319.9914855957031
27647/28840	Truly   Without reckoning said Athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of Cahusac I should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your	131.20310974121094
27648/28840	Why he is a very devil this Béarnais _Ventresaintgris_ Monsieur de Tréville as the king my father would have	261.279541015625
27649/28840	But at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords	1588.30517578125
27650/28840	Which is to say that the Gascons made a king of me myself seeing that I am my fathers son is it not Tréville Well happily I dont say nay to	115.73253631591797

27653/28840	This is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the	94.69209289550781
27654/28840	Poor cardinal Seven men in two days and those of his very best But thats quite enough gentlemen please to understand thats	947.4336547851562
27655/28840	You have taken your revenge for the Rue Férou and even exceeded it you ought to be	216.32284545898438
27656/28840	If your Majesty is so said Tréville we	494.96771240234375
27657/28840	Oh yes I am added the king taking a handful of gold from La Chesnaye and putting it into the hand of DArtagn	198.24139404296875
27658/28840	Here said he is a proof of my	81.25260925292969

27660/28840	A gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world	259.4193420410156
27661/28840	DArtagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scrupleon the contrary thanking his Majesty	213.6851806640625
27662/28840	There said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as I told you I expect someone at	145.57972717285156
27663/28840	I may continue to rely upon it may I not   Oh sire cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majestys	131.79347229003906
27664/28840	Well well but keep whole that will be better and you will be more useful to	129.61502075195312
27665/28840	Ah _pardieu_ Tréville I enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will	117.84233856201172
27666/28840	He will be furious but I dont	98.7382583618164
27667/28840	The king waved his hand to Tréville who left him and rejoined the Musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with DArtagn	74.92987060546875
27668/28840	The cardinal as his Majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the kings gaming	1202.8846435546875
27669/28840	The repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at	288.13641357421875
27670/28840	The repast had been ordered by Athos and the lackey furnished by Porth	41.256858825683594
27671/28840	He was a Picard whom the glorious Musketeer had picked up on the Bridge Tournelle making rings and plashing in the	1116.710205078125
27672/28840	Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other	689.9006958007812
27673/28840	The noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won Planchetthat was the name of the	204.44601440429688
27674/28840	Nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a Crœs	176.32652282714844
27675/28840	He preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of Planchet faded	417.6483459472656
27676/28840	The bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a	53.52512741088867
27677/28840	Planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of DArtagnan and which DArtagnan from that time made shift to do	77.75518035888672
27678/28840	Athos on his part had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion and who was named Grim	214.19219970703125
27679/28840	He was very taciturn this worthy sign	906.409423828125
27680/28840	Be it understood we are speaking of Ath	119.134765625
27681/28840	During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions Porthos and Aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him	97.4693832397461
27682/28840	His words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more no embellishments no embroidery no arabes	554.1990966796875
27683/28840	His conversation was a matter of fact without a single	332.89874267578125
27684/28840	Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a	123.89077758789062
27685/28840	He certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to	121.49549865722656
27686/28840	His reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of	224.82981872558594
27687/28840	He had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his	149.68434143066406
27688/28840	He never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary	223.64468383789062
27689/28840	Sometimes Grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the	360.0966796875
27690/28840	Athos then shrugged his shoulders and without putting himself in a passion thrashed Grim	309.4129638671875
27691/28840	On these days he spoke a	182.1582794189453
27692/28840	Porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of Ath	62.49604034423828
27693/28840	He not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or	1738.4051513671875
27694/28840	He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself	188.21664428710938
27695/28840	He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his	1320.4326171875
27696/28840	He had not so noble an air as Athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid	327.22467041015625
27697/28840	But with his simple Musketeers uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot Athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second	109.48942565917969
27698/28840	Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of	84.59629821777344
27699/28840	An old proverb says Like master like	7516.02197265625
27700/28840	Let us pass then from the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos from Grimaud to Mousqu	38.340545654296875
27701/28840	Mousqueton was a Norman whose pacific name of Boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqu	757.5397338867188
27702/28840	He had entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other	337.48138427734375
27703/28840	Porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully	762.0797119140625
27704/28840	As for Aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the charactera character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its developmenthis lackey was called Baz	184.7996368408203
27705/28840	Thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a church	649.9703979492188
27706/28840	He was a Berrichon thirtyfive or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but	3743.158203125
27707/28840	For the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable	5565.21240234375
27708/28840	And now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of	406.9950256347656
27709/28840	Athos dwelt in the Rue Férou within two steps of the	94.4437255859375
27710/28840	His apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at	599.6185302734375
27711/28840	It had long been an object of ambition for Porth	90.53278350830078
27712/28840	Porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this	59.466094970703125
27713/28840	One day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of Ath	69.22300720214844
27714/28840	In addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry	271.42266845703125
27715/28840	dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the Order of the King was his	659.9406127929688
27716/28840	Besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the	283.3857421875
27717/28840	Athos always carried the key of this coffer about him but he one day opened it before Porthos and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and paperslove letters and family papers no	185.96522521972656
27718/28840	Porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the Rue du VieuxColomb	388.8981018066406
27719/28840	With regard to DArtagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey Master Planc	55.28437423706055
27720/28840	He addressed himself then to Porthos to gain information respecting Athos and Aramis and to Aramis in order to learn something of Porth	38.765594482421875
27721/28840	Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed	127.89787292480469
27722/28840	It was said Athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant	174.15296936035156
27723/28840	What could this treachery be All the world was ignorant of	243.9040069580078
27724/28840	As to Porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily	108.04914855957031
27725/28840	Vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a	158.42062377929688
27726/28840	The only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of	413.3301696777344
27727/28840	And you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others   _Pardieu_ I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before	151.5572052001953
27728/28840	But be assured my dear Monsieur dArtagnan that if I had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than	46.511383056640625
27729/28840	The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my	56.27930450439453
27730/28840	I was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he	68.25670623779297
27731/28840	As for myself I neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of Athos who has none any more than I	98.8296890258789
27732/28840	But what the devil You are not a priest you are a Musketeer   A Musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a Musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe	80.27161407470703
27733/28840	Athos and Porthos dragged me into this to occupy	106.93092346191406
27734/28840	I had at the moment of being ordained a little difficulty withBut that would not interest you and I am taking up your valuable	351.2284240722656
27735/28840	Not at all it interests me very much cried DArtagnan and at this moment I have absolutely nothing to	51.322669982910156
27736/28840	Yes but I have my breviary to repeat answered Aramis then some verses to compose which Madame dAiguillon begged of	218.31253051757812
27737/28840	Then I must go to the Rue	89.12300109863281
27738/28840	Honoré in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de Chevre	100.65215301513672
27739/28840	So you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry I am very much in a	25.575841903686523
27740/28840	Aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of	53.4284553527832
27741/28840	Notwithstanding all the pains he took DArtagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three newmade	343.1634216308594
27742/28840	He formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the	529.2664184570312
27743/28840	In the meanwhile he looked upon Athos as an Achilles Porthos as an Ajax and Aramis as a	360.1368713378906
27744/28840	As to the rest the life of the four young friends was joyous	149.19671630859375
27745/28840	Athos played and that as a rule	748.9868774414062
27746/28840	Nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six oclock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding	217.87835693359375
27747/28840	On the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious if he lost he disappeared completely for several days after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person but with money in his	313.5862731933594
27748/28840	He was the worst Musketeer and the most unconvivial companion	607.4992065429688
27749/28840	He had always something or other to	178.53443908691406
27750/28840	At other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb	206.43992614746094
27751/28840	At this Athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and Porthos would drink swearing that Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé	262.99560546875
27752/28840	Planchet DArtagnans valet supported his good fortune nob	162.465087890625

27754/28840	When the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des Fossoyeursthat is to say when the forty pistoles of King Louis	271.5969543457031
27755/28840	were consumed or nearly sohe commenced complaints which Athos thought nauseous Porthos indecent and Aramis	1512.6011962890625
27756/28840	Athos counseled DArtagnan to dismiss the fellow Porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first and Aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to	189.18345642089844
27757/28840	It is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to	242.86216735839844
27758/28840	DArtagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that DArtagnan carried into	212.15911865234375
27759/28840	After having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his	278.38818359375

27761/28840	Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you	150.8469696044922
27762/28840	This manner of acting roused much respect for DArtagnans policy among the Musket	218.1501007080078
27763/28840	Planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going	126.26642608642578

27782/28840	At first Athos supported the association for a time with his own	269.6541748046875
27783/28840	Porthos succeeded him and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a	147.28060913085938
27784/28840	At last it became Aramiss turn who performed it with a good grace and who succeededas he said by selling some theological booksin procuring a few pist	625.5567016601562
27785/28840	Then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to	57.43861770629883

27787/28840	At length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which Porthos went to the gaming	105.79955291748047
27788/28840	Unfortunately he was in a bad vein he lost all together with twentyfive pistoles for which he had given his	98.14830780029297
27789/28840	Athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with	149.26873779296875
27790/28840	Porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them Aramis had eight of	155.941650390625
27791/28840	He was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought	204.15921020507812
27792/28840	As to DArtagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the	229.4683837890625
27793/28840	He fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month and he set his mind actively to	606.49658203125
27794/28840	He reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less	1685.629638671875
27795/28840	The only thing that astonished DArtagnan was that his friends had never thought of	63.80869674682617
27796/28840	DArtagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open	24.92518424987793

27799/28840	A man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a trades	303.0612487792969
27800/28840	Planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to DArtagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with	86.44966888427734
27801/28840	DArtagnan dismissed Planchet and requested his visitor to be	49.9521369934082
27802/28840	There was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which DArtagnan bowed as a sign that he	48.084556579589844
27803/28840	I have heard Monsieur dArtagnan spoken of as a very brave young man said the citizen and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to	130.02877807617188
27804/28840	Speak monsieur speak said DArtagnan who instinctively scented something	87.39903259277344
27805/28840	The citizen made a fresh pause and continued I have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or	279.58026123046875
27806/28840	I was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because Monsieur Laporte the queens cloak bearer is her godfather and befriends	305.09552001953125
27807/28840	Well resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her work	392.6660461425781
27808/28840	And by whom was your wife abducted   I know nothing surely monsieur but I suspect	259.5726623535156
27809/28840	And who is the person whom you suspect   A man who has pursued her a long	72.58097076416016
27810/28840	The devil   But allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that I am convinced that there is less love than politics in all	44.730987548828125
27811/28840	Less love than politics replied DArtagnan with a reflective air and what do you suspect   I do not know whether I ought to tell you what I	44.402862548828125
27812/28840	Monsieur I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely	55.98421096801758
27813/28840	It is you who have come to	49.414329528808594
27814/28840	It is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in	40.723262786865234
27815/28840	Act then as you think proper there is still time to	220.06915283203125
27816/28840	No monsieur no you appear to be an honest young man and I will have confidence in	30.940994262695312
27817/28840	I believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than	105.64130401611328
27818/28840	Ah ah Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de BoisTracy said DArtagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court	151.4132537841797
27819/28840	Of Madame dAiguillon   Still	383.6186218261719
27820/28840	Of Madame de Chevreuse   Higher much	366.7464294433594
27821/28840	Yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely	38.02922058105469
27822/28840	And with whom   With whom can it be if not the Duke of   The Duke of   Yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his	82.80398559570312
27823/28840	But how do you know all this   How do I know it   Yes how do you know it No halfconfidence oryou understand   I know it from my wife monsieurfrom my wife	66.26245880126953
27824/28840	Who learns it from whom   From Monsieur Laport	35.43266296386719
27825/28840	Ah ah It begins to develop itself said DArtagn	93.9840087890625
27826/28840	Now my wife came home four days ago monsie	169.17686462402344

27828/28840	The cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than	458.1715087890625
27829/28840	He cannot pardon her the history of the Sar	1328.3170166015625
27830/28840	You know the history of the Saraband   _Pardieu_ Know it replied DArtagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going	51.554283142089844
27831/28840	So that now it is no longer hatred but	221.3823699951172
27832/28840	Indeed   And the queen believes   Well what does the queen believe   She believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her	64.03226470947266
27833/28840	In the queens name   Yes to make him come to Paris and when once come to Paris to draw him into some sn	74.7833480834961
27834/28840	That is likely said DArtagnan but the man who has abducted herdo you know him   I have told you that I believe I know	43.72136306762695
27835/28840	His name   I do not know that what I do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil	48.02737045288086
27836/28840	But you have seen him   Yes my wife pointed him out to me one	70.42988586425781
27837/28840	Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him   Oh certainly he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his	466.92950439453125
27838/28840	A scar on his temple cried DArtagnan and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriagewhy thats my man of Me	245.91087341308594
27839/28840	He is your man do you say   Yes yes but that has nothing to do with	27.697540283203125
27840/28840	On the contrary that simplifies the matter	6309.41845703125
27841/28840	If your man is mine with one blow I shall obtain two revenges thats all but where to find this man   I know	179.98147583007812
27842/28840	Have you no information as to his abiding place  	1254.0791015625

27844/28840	The devil The devil murmured DArtagnan all this is vague	59.82932662963867
27845/28840	From whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife   From Monsieur Laport	45.57492446899414
27846/28840	Did he give you any details   He knew none	124.38996887207031
27847/28840	And you have learned nothing from any other quarter   Yes I have received   What   I fear I am committing a great impr	74.26679229736328
27848/28840	You always come back to that but I must make you see this time that it is too late to	55.426856994628906
27849/28840	I do not retreat _mordieu_ cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his	366.2869873046875
27850/28840	Besides by the faith of Bonacieux   You call yourself Bonacieux interrupted DArtagn	57.96154022216797
27851/28840	You said then by the word of Bonacie	67.98512268066406
27852/28840	Pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to	62.52462387084961
27853/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan half rising and bowing you are my landlord   Yes monsieur	29.279287338256836
27854/28840	And as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rentas I say I have not tormented you a single instant I thought you would appreciate my delic	135.9332275390625
27855/28840	Finish then what you were about to	38.22782897949219
27856/28840	The citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to DArtagn	22.66580581665039
27857/28840	DArtagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read	40.502052307128906
27858/28840	Do not seek your wife read DArtagnan she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for	69.63126373291016
27859/28840	If you make a single step to find her you are	125.46190643310547
27860/28840	Thats pretty positive continued DArtagnan but after all it is but a	165.20314025878906
27861/28840	I am not a fighting man at all monsieur and I am afraid of the Bast	53.98934555053711
27862/28840	I have no greater regard for the Bastille than	209.2982940673828
27863/28840	If it were nothing but a sword thrust why then   I have counted upon you on this occasion monsie	82.8165512084961
27864/28840	And then I have thought that considering three months lodging about which I have said nothing   Yes yes you have already given me that reason and I find it	113.40831756591797
27865/28840	Whom do I see yonder   Where   In the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a	90.470947265625
27866/28840	It is he cried DArtagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his	65.55228424072266
27867/28840	Ah this time cried DArtagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me   Drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the	63.11831283569336
27868/28840	On the staircase he met Athos and Porthos who were coming to see	35.77587127685547
27869/28840	They separated and DArtagnan rushed between them like a	95.73655700683594
27870/28840	Pah Where are you going cried the two Musketeers in a	88.521240234375
27871/28840	The man of Meung replied DArtagnan and	99.210205078125
27872/28840	DArtagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important miss	84.15433502197266
27873/28840	The opinion of Athos was that DArtagnan had lost his letter in the skirm	40.90300750732422
27874/28840	A gentleman in his opinionand according to DArtagnans portrait of him the stranger must be a gentlemanwould be incapable of the baseness of stealing a	221.085205078125
27875/28840	Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of DArtagnan and his yellow	69.42435455322266
27876/28840	Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom	215.70132446289062
27877/28840	They understood then from the few words which escaped from DArtagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him DArtagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their	69.28704833984375

27879/28840	DARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF     As Athos and Porthos had foreseen at the expiration of a half hour DArtagnan	2587.675537109375
27880/28840	He had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by	120.48248291015625
27881/28840	DArtagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought	129.66632080078125
27882/28840	While DArtagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors Aramis had joined his companions so that on returning home DArtagnan found the reunion	160.5016632080078

27885/28840	Do you believe in apparitions asked Athos of Porth	92.24199676513672
27886/28840	I never believe in anything I have not seen and as I never have seen apparitions I dont believe in	100.20210266113281
27887/28840	The Bible said Aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of Samuel appeared to Saul and it is an article of faith that I should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon Porth	360.57281494140625

27889/28840	How is that cried Porthos and Aramis in a	36.73881912231445
27890/28840	As to Athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating DArtagnan by a	84.99027252197266
27891/28840	Ah ah You have credit with your landlord then asked Porth	131.6883087158203
27892/28840	Yes replied DArtagnan from this very day and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find	79.5116958618164
27893/28840	We must use and not abuse said Aramis sentent	641.010986328125
27894/28840	I always said that DArtagnan had the longest head of the four said Athos who having uttered his opinion to which DArtagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed	117.41270446777344
27895/28840	But come what is this about asked Porth	95.00470733642578
27896/28840	Yes said Aramis impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence in that case you would do better to keep it to	116.56461334228516
27897/28840	Be satisfied replied DArtagnan the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what I have to	36.879364013671875
27898/28840	He then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the Jolly	377.02001953125
27899/28840	Your affair is not bad said Athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good	151.03553771972656
27900/28840	Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four	278.1519775390625
27901/28840	But observe cried DArtagnan that there is a woman in the affaira woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her	158.9485626220703
27902/28840	You grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of Madame Bonacie	156.48997497558594

27906/28840	Why does she love what we hate most in the world the Spaniards and the English   Spain is her country replied DArtagnan and it is very natural that she should love the Spanish who are the children of the same soil as	104.55836486816406
27907/28840	As to the second reproach I have heard it said that she does not love the English but an English	68.75414276123047
27908/28840	Well and by my faith said Athos it must be acknowledged that this Englishman is worthy of being	78.88137817382812
27909/28840	I never saw a man with a nobler air than	303.98492431640625

27915/28840	Go on while I endeavor to recall	730.4483032226562
27916/28840	And now I am convinced said DArtagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in	68.62109375

27923/28840	This doctor has a niece continued Aram	469.3597717285156
27924/28840	Ah he has a niece interrupted Porth	145.54161071777344
27925/28840	Ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied Aramis you shall know	77.41659545898438
27926/28840	We believe like Mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said Ath	3372.929931640625
27927/28840	This niece comes sometimes to see her uncle and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that I was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her	120.46554565429688
27928/28840	Ah She has a carriage then this niece of the doctor interrupted Porthos one of whose faults was a great looseness of	566.5899658203125
27929/28840	A nice acquaintance my friend   Porthos replied Aramis I have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the	100.79815673828125
27930/28840	Gentlemen gentlemen cried DArtagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is	99.68065643310547
27931/28840	Let us try not to jest if we	165.22764587402344
27932/28840	All at once a tall dark gentlemanjust like yours DArtagn	331.50592041015625
27933/28840	will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise   He took you for Buckingham cried DArtagn	97.04837799072266
27934/28840	He took her for the queen said DArtagn	22.24533462524414
27935/28840	The Gascon is the devil cried Athos nothing escapes	89.37429809570312
27936/28840	The fact is said Porthos Aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a Musketeer   I wore an enormous cloak said Aram	59.613582611083984
27937/28840	In the month of July The devil said Porth	60.64774703979492
27938/28840	Is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized   I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person but the face   I had a large hat said Aram	75.2977523803711
27939/28840	Oh good lord cried Porthos what precautions for the study of theology   Gentlemen gentlemen said DArtagnan do not let us lose our time in j	58.30120849609375
27940/28840	Let us separate and let us seek the mercers wifethat is the key of the	160.59796142578125
27941/28840	A woman of such inferior condition Can you believe so said Porthos protruding his lips with	456.6954650878906
27942/28840	She is goddaughter to Laporte the confidential valet of the	1216.25048828125
27943/28840	Have I not told you so gentlemen Besides it has perhaps been her Majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so	1524.4981689453125
27944/28840	High heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is long	5724.90478515625
27945/28840	Well said Porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good	115.55233001708984
27946/28840	Thats useless said DArtagnan for I believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another	76.72061157226562
27947/28840	At this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was	176.88282775878906
27948/28840	Save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cried	290.9806823730469
27949/28840	There are four men come to arrest	179.04776000976562
27950/28840	Save me Save me   Porthos and Aramis	38.015567779541016
27951/28840	A moment cried DArtagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their halfdrawn	182.44635009765625
27952/28840	It is not courage that is needed it is prud	288.2705383300781
27953/28840	And yet cried Porthos we will not leave   You will leave DArtagnan to act as he thinks proper said Ath	38.18587875366211
27954/28840	He has I repeat the longest head of the four and for my part I declare that I will obey	237.4303741455078
27955/28840	At this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four Musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going	248.67935180664062
27956/28840	Come in gentlemen come in called DArtagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and	69.05951690673828
27957/28840	Then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the	255.7191619873047
27958/28840	On the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were	125.95030975341797
27959/28840	Silence   But you promised me whispered the poor mer	412.47607421875
27960/28840	We can only save you by being free ourselves replied DArtagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with	77.22266387939453
27961/28840	It seems nevertheless   Come gentlemen come said DArtagnan aloud I have no motive for defending Monsie	51.24668884277344
27962/28840	I saw him today for the first time and he can tell you on what occasion he came to demand the rent of my	74.88001251220703
27963/28840	And DArtagnan pushed the halfstupefied mercer among the Guards saying to him You are a shabby old fellow my	523.8416748046875
27964/28840	You come to demand money of meof a Musketeer To prison with him Gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay	192.3121795654297
27965/28840	The officers were full of thanks and took away their	250.49977111816406
27966/28840	As they were going down DArtagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their	45.77021026611328
27967/28840	May I not drink to your health and you to mine said DArtagnan filling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of	216.33840942382812
27968/28840	That will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and I accept	438.0694274902344
27969/28840	Then to yours monsieurwhat is your name   Boisren	123.084716796875
27970/28840	To yours my gentlemen What is your name in your turn if you please   DArtagn	34.0300178527832
27971/28840	And above all others cried DArtagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the	55.182525634765625
27972/28840	The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of DArtagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was	111.63081359863281
27973/28840	What diabolical villainy you have performed here said Porthos when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves	85.44367218017578
27974/28840	DArtagnan you are a great man and when you occupy Monsieur de Trévilles place I will come and ask your influence to secure me an ab	65.4073486328125
27975/28840	Well I am in a maze said Porthos do _you_ approve of what DArtagnan has done   _Parbleu_ Indeed I do said Athos I not only approve of what he has done but I congratulate him upon	53.378990173339844
27976/28840	And now gentlemen said DArtagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos All for one one for allthat is our motto is it not   And yet said Porth	73.16383361816406
27977/28840	Hold out your hand and swear cried Athos and Aramis at	79.09610748291016
27978/28840	Overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless Porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by DArtagnan   All for one one for	140.90020751953125
27979/28840	Thats well Now let us everyone retire to his own home said DArtagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention For from this moment we are at feud with the	161.99090576171875
27980/28840	As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de Jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mouset	122.84368133544922
27981/28840	When in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held	355.822021484375
27982/28840	Four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first	55.29336166381836
27983/28840	The door is opened to all who	1021.3101806640625
27984/28840	It is closed after them and they are arrested so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the _habitués_ of the	170.1796417236328
27985/28840	Bonacieux then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinals	149.88232421875
27986/28840	It must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which DArtagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this	283.3388671875
27987/28840	Besides nobody came thither but the three Musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered	233.39840698242188
27988/28840	Athos had even gone so far as to question	173.4813690185547
27989/28840	de Trévillea thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer had very much astonished his	423.6688537597656
27990/28840	de Tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queens eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tear	191.9394989013672
27991/28840	But this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept	170.32650756835938
27992/28840	de Tréville requested Athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his	159.88751220703125
27993/28840	As to DArtagnan he did not budge from his	236.6392822265625
27994/28840	He converted his chamber into an observ	699.8840942382812
27995/28840	From his windows he saw all the visitors who were	238.46798706054688
27996/28840	Then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the	266.3555908203125
27997/28840	Now what is it they want to know Why they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the	74.63298034667969
27998/28840	DArtagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in	160.03936767578125
27999/28840	In the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise DArtagnans	353.55859375
28000/28840	On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux as Athos had just left DArtagnan to report at	45.96684646606445
28001/28840	de Trévilles as nine oclock had just struck and as Planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street	108.62861633300781
28002/28840	The door was instantly opened and shut someone was taken in the mouset	206.26498413085938
28003/28840	DArtagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and	107.93657684326172
28004/28840	Cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to st	179.53138732910156
28005/28840	It seems like a woman They search her she resists they use forcethe scoundrels   In spite of his prudence DArtagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on	323.30694580078125
28006/28840	But I tell you that I am the mistress of the house gentlemen I tell you I am Madame Bonacieux I tell you I belong to the queen cried the unfortunate	45.045753479003906
28007/28840	Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for   The voice became more and more indistinct a tumultuous movement shook the	199.4440460205078
28008/28840	The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four	292.1121520996094
28009/28840	Pardon gentlemenpar murmured the voice which could now only be heard in inarticulate	163.73207092285156
28010/28840	They are binding her they are going to drag her away cried DArtagnan to himself springing up from the	122.58848571777344
28011/28840	My sword Good it is by my side Planchet   Monsie	45.835777282714844
28012/28840	Run and seek Athos Porthos and Aram	23.353755950927734
28013/28840	One of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all	127.80045318603516
28014/28840	Tell them to take arms to come here and to run Ah I remember Athos is at Monsieur de Trév	171.70718383789062
28015/28840	But where are you going monsieur where are you going   I am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried DArtagn	22.47711753845215
28016/28840	You put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as I told	198.16920471191406
28017/28840	Oh monsieur Monsieur You will kill yourself cried Planc	20.586509704589844
28018/28840	Hold your tongue stupid fellow said DArtagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest	270.7420959472656
28019/28840	Bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after	176.82159423828125
28020/28840	Then those who dwelt in Bonacieuxs unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of	730.6995239257812
28021/28840	DArtagnan was conquerorwithout much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for forms	272.25225830078125
28022/28840	It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery but two or three scratches made by the Gascons blade terrified	292.6784973144531
28023/28840	Ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and DArtagnan remained master of the field of	58.6431999206543
28024/28840	The neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was	331.3014221191406
28025/28840	Besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the	173.63389587402344
28026/28840	Bonacieux DArtagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left halffainting upon an arm	61.50055694580078
28027/28840	DArtagnan examined her with a rapid	25.190975189208984
28028/28840	She was a charming woman of twentyfive or twentysix years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and op	214.29446411132812
28029/28840	There however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of	239.5840301513672
28030/28840	The hands were white but without delicacy the feet did not bespeak the woman of	1621.624755859375
28031/28840	Happily DArtagnan was not yet acquainted with such nic	143.50106811523438
28032/28840	From that time DArtagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of M	101.51004028320312

28035/28840	She extended her hands to him with a	40.17074966430664
28036/28840	Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the	43.19721221923828
28037/28840	Ah monsieur said she you have saved me permit me to thank	20.909555435180664
28038/28840	Madame said DArtagnan I have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place you owe me no	54.63692855834961

28040/28840	My husband in the Bastille cried M	1511.4664306640625
28041/28840	Oh my God What has he done Poor dear man he is innocence itself   And something like a faint smile lighted the stillterrified features of the young	320.8561096191406
28042/28840	What has he done madame said DArtagn	21.034120559692383
28043/28840	I believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your	41.656349182128906
28044/28840	But monsieur you know then   I know that you have been abducted mad	54.40184020996094
28045/28840	And by whom Do you know him Oh if you know him tell me   By a man of from forty to fortyfive years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left	74.92644500732422
28046/28840	That is he that is he but his name   Ah his name I do not know	31.223392486572266
28047/28840	And did my husband know I had been carried off   He was informed of it by a letter written to him by the abductor	113.46576690673828
28048/28840	Bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event   He attributed it I believe to a political	123.51091766357422
28049/28840	I doubted from the first and now I think entirely as he	134.77630615234375
28050/28840	Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant   So far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your	63.4879264831543
28051/28840	A second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young	254.5740509033203
28052/28840	But continued DArtagnan how did you escape   I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the	66.85299682617188
28053/28840	Then as I believed my husband would be at home I hastened	140.930908203125
28054/28840	To place yourself under his protection   Oh no poor dear man I knew very well that he was incapable of defending me but as he could serve us in other ways I wished to inform	117.23284149169922
28055/28840	Of what   Oh that is not my secret I must not therefore tell	58.7540168762207

28059/28840	Bonacieux let us fly Let us save	105.20928192138672
28060/28840	At these words she passed her arm under that of DArtagnan and urged him forward	84.00054931640625

28062/28840	The young woman and the young man without taking the trouble to shut the door after them descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly turned into the Rue des FossésMonsieurlePrince and did not stop till they came to the Place	262.7486572265625
28063/28840	And now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked DArtagn	26.325105667114258
28064/28840	I am at quite a loss how to answer you I admit said M	617.1259155273438
28065/28840	My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte through my husband in order that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the Louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself	56.3978271484375
28066/28840	But I said DArtagnan can go and inform Monsieur Laport	19.15623664855957
28067/28840	No doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that Monsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against	91.94864654541016
28068/28840	Ah bah said DArtagnan you have at some wicket of the Louvre a _concierge_ who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would   M	88.20136260986328
28069/28840	Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young	25.155677795410156
28070/28840	And if I give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it   By my honor by the faith of a gentleman said DArtagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake	69.7425765991211
28071/28840	You appear to be a brave young man besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devoted	50.68975067138672
28072/28840	I will do without a promise and voluntarily all that I can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the	74.7385025024414
28073/28840	Dispose of me then as a	156.897705078125
28074/28840	But Iwhere shall I go meanwhile   Is there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch you   No I can trust	100.60311126708984
28075/28840	Stop said DArtagnan we are near Athoss	30.862586975097656
28076/28840	Who is this Athos   One of my	38.21030807495117
28077/28840	But if he should be at home and see me   He is not at home and I will carry away the key after having placed you in his	39.70843505859375
28078/28840	But if he should return   Oh he wont return and if he should he will be told that I have brought a woman with me and that woman is in his	62.0862922668457
28079/28840	But that will compromise me sadly you	561.8749389648438
28080/28840	Besides we are in a situation to overlook	928.9819946289062
28081/28840	Come then let us go to your friends	74.1466293334961
28082/28840	Where does he live   Rue Férou two steps from	107.83307647705078
28083/28840	Let us go   Both resumed their	169.4171142578125
28084/28840	As DArtagnan had foreseen Athos was not	30.85724449157715
28085/28840	He took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced M	402.2409362792969
28086/28840	Bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a	72.0404281616211
28087/28840	Remain here fasten the door inside and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this and he tapped thricetwo taps close together and pretty hard the other after an interval and	2042.450927734375
28088/28840	Now in my turn let me give you my	157.0822296142578
28089/28840	Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre on the side of the Rue de lEchelle and ask for Germ	119.48675537109375
28090/28840	Well and then   He will ask you what you want and you will answer by these two words Tours and Bruxell	230.2163848876953
28091/28840	He will at once put himself at your	221.12474060058594
28092/28840	And what shall I command him   To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte the queens _valet de chambre	33.94314193725586
28093/28840	And when he shall have informed him and Monsieur Laporte is come   You will send him to	31.680681228637695
28094/28840	That is well but where and how shall I see you again   Do you wish to see me again  	27.34622573852539
28095/28840	Well let that care be mine and be at	720.8980712890625
28096/28840	Bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double	154.18118286132812
28097/28840	In two bounds he was at the Louvre as he entered the wicket of LEchelle ten oclock	233.4014129638672
28098/28840	All the events we have described had taken place within a half	141.869873046875
28099/28840	In a few minutes Laporte was at the lodge in two words DArtagnan informed him where M	77.68810272216797
28100/28840	Laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a	470.9876708984375
28101/28840	Hardly however had he taken ten steps before he	240.69017028808594
28102/28840	Young man said he to DArtagnan a	90.4347152709961
28103/28840	What   You may get into trouble by what has taken	58.17701721191406
28104/28840	Have you any friend whose clock is too slow   Well   Go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past	148.84596252441406
28105/28840	In a court of justice that is called an al	1811.0986328125
28106/28840	He took to his heels and was soon at	125.73871612548828
28107/28840	de Trévilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to	152.09556579589844
28108/28840	As DArtagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform	357.5768127441406
28109/28840	de Tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private	1747.92236328125
28110/28840	de Tréville was asking DArtagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an	71.9724349975586
28111/28840	Pardon me monsieur said DArtagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back	21.117664337158203
28112/28840	de Trévilles clock threequarters of an hour but I thought as it was yet only twentyfive minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon	156.52764892578125
28113/28840	de Tréville looking at the clock why thats impossible   Look rather monsieur said DArtagnan the clock shows	68.23135375976562
28114/28840	But what can I do for you   Then DArtagnan told	24.985925674438477
28115/28840	de Tréville a long history about the	231.042724609375
28116/28840	He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which	116.81183624267578
28117/28840	de Tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the	129.49684143066406
28118/28840	As ten oclock was striking DArtagnan left	54.19145202636719
28119/28840	de Tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs DArtagnan remembered he had forgotten his	75.41917419433594
28120/28840	IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS     His visit to	219045.8125
28121/28840	de Tréville being paid the pensive DArtagnan took the longest way homew	942.388671875
28122/28840	On what was DArtagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling   He was thinking of M	307.98028564453125
28123/28840	For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of	1456.3499755859375
28124/28840	Pretty mysterious initiated in almost all the secrets of the court which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved and this is an irresistible charm to novices in	340.3739013671875
28125/28840	Moreover DArtagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender	159.4204559326172
28126/28840	DArtagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a	184.95936584472656
28127/28840	We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without	496.31842041015625

28129/28840	Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty whence without doubt comes the proverb The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she	463.05859375
28130/28840	Provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers gave their	1745.78662109375
28131/28840	DArtagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at Paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in FlandersSpain yonder woman	197.02337646484375
28132/28840	In each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be	250.8014373779297
28133/28840	But we must say at the present moment DArtagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and dis	63.87712860107422
28134/28840	The mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as	211.83694458007812
28135/28840	Bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of	235.95162963867188
28136/28840	We say _almost_ for the idea that a young handsome kind and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love but on the contrary strengthens	284.0333557128906
28137/28840	There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to	1065.22265625
28138/28840	In the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a womans happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of noth	422.9419860839844
28139/28840	At least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to	335.5652160644531
28140/28840	Then DArtagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted	77.02305603027344
28141/28840	In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercers wife he did not forget his	130.57232666015625
28142/28840	Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain	467.6665954589844
28143/28840	Denis or in the fair of	114.46206665039062
28144/28840	Germain in company with Athos Porthos and Aramis to whom DArtagnan had often remarked	18.7382869720459
28145/28840	Then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a	190.3387908935547
28146/28840	Besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties DArtagnan would become the preserver of his	126.76860046386719
28147/28840	Love is the most selfish of all the	142.05738830566406
28148/28840	If DArtagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he	68.58324432373047
28149/28840	But for the moment let us do as did the amorous Gascon we will see after the worthy mercer	364.28302001953125
28150/28840	DArtagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the Rue CherishMidi or ChaseMidi as it was then	1588.5499267578125
28151/28840	This mystery required an explanation at least so DArtagnan declared to	94.22021484375
28152/28840	He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little M	921.5006713867188
28153/28840	Bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already	126.45496368408203
28154/28840	We must never look for discretion in first	1174.345458984375

28156/28840	Paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a	224.21530151367188
28157/28840	Eleven oclock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg	68.39171600341797
28158/28840	From a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the	1035.92236328125
28159/28840	Arrived at the end of the lane DArtagnan turned to the	35.41010665893555
28160/28840	The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandon	503.7332458496094
28161/28840	This something was enveloped in a cloak and DArtagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a	62.64507293701172
28162/28840	Further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned	278.848388671875
28163/28840	Shall I go and offer her my services thought	234.9222869873047
28164/28840	By her step she must be young perhaps she is	346.5108947753906
28165/28840	Oh yes But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her	648.1784057617188
28166/28840	If I should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an	62.623775482177734
28167/28840	Meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and	274.3912048339844
28168/28840	There were but three hôtels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied the other belonging to Aramis	162.0792999267578
28169/28840	_Pardieu_ said DArtagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted _pardieu_ it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friends	145.8701171875
28170/28840	But on my soul it looks	329.8127136230469
28171/28840	Ah my dear Aramis this time I shall find you	38.31842803955078
28172/28840	And DArtagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a	78.50883483886719
28173/28840	The young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet	205.6953125
28174/28840	DArtagnan believed this cough to be a	86.09989929199219
28175/28840	This is all very fine dear Aramis murmured DArtagn	30.875350952148438
28176/28840	Ah Monsieur Hypocrite I understand how you study	7001.0009765625
28177/28840	The three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside	339.5023193359375
28178/28840	Ah ah said the listener not through doors but through windows Ah this visit was	1752.5802001953125
28179/28840	We shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escal	1455.1463623046875
28180/28840	Very pretty   But to the great astonishment of DArtagnan the shutter remained	73.0004653930664
28181/28840	Still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in	168.4004364013672
28182/28840	DArtagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his	70.14717864990234
28183/28840	He was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard	943.6639404296875
28184/28840	The young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little	265.88824462890625
28185/28840	It may be judged whether DArtagnan looked or listened with av	176.52867126464844
28186/28840	Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the	63.832740783691406
28187/28840	Besides the eyes of the Gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the	165.44357299804688
28188/28840	DArtagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handker	49.938812255859375
28189/28840	She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded	1120.537841796875
28190/28840	This immediately recalled to DArtagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of M	60.7894401550293
28191/28840	Bonacieux which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aram	42.02104568481445
28192/28840	What the devil could that handkerchief signify   Placed where he was DArtagnan could not perceive the face of Aram	84.74407196044922
28193/28840	We say Aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the	95.29975891113281
28194/28840	At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to	73.17601013183594
28195/28840	Then some words were spoken by the two	151.4142608642578
28196/28840	The woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of DArtagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late DArtagnan had already recognized M	132.55279541015625
28197/28840	Bonacieux The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of DArtagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that M	83.77638244628906
28198/28840	But was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards This was a question the young man asked himself whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted	354.1488037109375
28199/28840	There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither M	1852.4561767578125
28200/28840	Bonacieux was going that was to follow	58.7441520690918
28201/28840	This method was so simple that DArtagnan employed it quite naturally and	169.60350036621094
28202/28840	But at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her M	137.6842498779297
28203/28840	Bonacieux uttered a little cry and	58.420589447021484
28204/28840	It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her	323.3561096191406
28205/28840	He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the	74.17301177978516
28206/28840	Bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was	83.50653076171875
28207/28840	Was it with that intention you followed me asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an	129.64852905273438
28208/28840	No said DArtagnan no I confess	17.9915828704834
28209/28840	It was chance that threw me in your way I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my	143.44235229492188
28210/28840	Without doubt Aramis is one of my best	67.25160217285156
28211/28840	Aramis Who is he   Come come you wont tell me you dont know Aramis   This is the first time I ever heard his name	38.723758697509766
28212/28840	It is the first time then that you ever went to that house   Und	52.31087875366211
28213/28840	And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man  	37.34540939331055
28214/28840	By a Musketeer   No indeed   It was not he then you came to seek   Not the least in the	43.692935943603516
28215/28840	Besides you must have seen that the person to whom I spoke was a	68.8158950805664
28216/28840	That is true but this woman is a friend of Aramis   I know nothing of	28.582862854003906

28238/28840	Arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the Rue Vaugir	107.6962890625
28239/28840	She seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door And now monsieur said she it is here I have business a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone I was	117.5996322631836

28265/28840	That is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because I am only	130.28976440429688

28277/28840	Ah I wish I had never seen you cried DArtagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over	202.260986328125
28278/28840	Bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of DArtagnan who had not relinquished hers well I will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost	73.06527709960938
28279/28840	Who knows when I shall be at liberty that I may not satisfy your curiosity   And will you make the same promise to my love cried DArtagnan beside himself with	58.13996887207031
28280/28840	Oh as to that I do not engage	121.33535766601562

28300/28840	Five minutes later he was in the Rue des Fossoye	65.31421661376953
28301/28840	Poor Athos said he he will never guess what all this	128.31631469726562
28302/28840	He will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been	108.73931884765625

28306/28840	How badly What do you mean by that you idiot asked DArtagn	58.342281341552734

28311/28840	They will believe he is arrested and that will give him time in three days I will tell them who I am and they cannot fail to let me	98.4889907836914

28314/28840	The last two mounted guard at the door during this examination then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and	233.27210998535156
28315/28840	And Porthos and Aramis   I could not find them they did not	23.38094711303711

28319/28840	Here it would be dangerous the house may be	282.61279296875
28320/28840	I will run to Monsieur de Tréville to tell them all this and will meet them	31.81037139892578
28321/28840	But you will remain you are not afraid said DArtagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lac	55.28339767456055
28322/28840	Be easy monsieur said Planchet you do not know me	23.001964569091797
28323/28840	I am brave when I set about	86.60884094238281
28324/28840	Then it is understood said DArtagnan you would rather be killed than desert your post   Yes monsieur and there is nothing I would not do to prove to Monsieur that I am attached to	35.0442008972168
28325/28840	It appears that the method I have adopted with this boy is decidedly the	338.63311767578125
28326/28840	I shall use it again upon	747.3037719726562
28327/28840	And with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day DArtagnan directed his course toward	143.04489135742188
28328/28840	de Tréville was not at his hô	80.50543975830078
28329/28840	His company was on guard at the Louvre he was at the Louvre with his	46.65730667114258
28330/28840	de Tréville it was important that he should be informed of what was	42.12183380126953
28331/28840	DArtagnan resolved to try and enter the Lou	24.28876495361328
28332/28840	His costume of Guardsman in the company of	1048.4635009765625
28333/28840	He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the New	162.45982360839844
28334/28840	He had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his	177.12100219726562
28335/28840	As he gained the top of the Rue Guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck	205.45936584472656
28336/28840	Of the two persons who composed this group one was a man and the other a	104.57881164550781
28337/28840	The woman had the outline of M	693.7600708007812
28338/28840	Bonacieux the man resembled Aramis so much as to be mistaken for	75.49109649658203
28339/28840	Besides the woman wore that black mantle which DArtagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a Musket	90.04216003417969
28340/28840	The womans hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his	132.35125732421875
28341/28840	Both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being	477.1400146484375
28342/28840	That was DArtagnans road as he was going to the Lou	33.07072067260742
28343/28840	He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really M	201.37698364257812
28344/28840	Bonacieux and that the man was Aram	27.017595291137695
28345/28840	He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his	256.30303955078125
28346/28840	He felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a	281.36273193359375
28347/28840	Bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know Aramis and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of Aram	46.50768280029297
28348/28840	DArtagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercers pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him	100.35907745361328
28349/28840	He considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed	22655.462890625
28350/28840	Blood and anger mounted to his face he was resolved to unravel the	300.500244140625
28351/28840	The young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their	203.0833282470703
28352/28840	He passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the	325.5887145996094
28353/28840	DArtagnan stopped before them and they stopped before	20.269216537475586
28354/28840	What do you want monsieur demanded the Musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to DArtagnan that he was deceived in one of his conject	68.2528305053711
28355/28840	No monsieur it is not Aramis and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon	58.001983642578125
28356/28840	Allow me then to pass on since it is not with me you have anything to	85.8385238647461

28361/28840	I hoped to be able to rely upon	41.16170120239258

28363/28840	DArtagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the Musketeer and M	230.70254516601562
28364/28840	The Musketeer advanced two steps and pushed DArtagnan aside with his	106.98595428466797
28365/28840	DArtagnan made a spring backward and drew his	45.49604034423828
28366/28840	At the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew	56.92508316040039

28377/28840	Fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any	133.9910888671875
28378/28840	As for DArtagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the PommedePin where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting	166.89913940429688
28379/28840	Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their	156.65040588378906
28380/28840	Meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Lou	111.79483032226562

28382/28840	Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without	35.072025299072266
28383/28840	Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of	44.80584716796875

28386/28840	Bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the Louvre that was	56.644596099853516
28387/28840	Bonacieux pushed a little servants door open by day but generally closed at	346.7283935546875

28391/28840	She then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a	93.7930679321289
28392/28840	Nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the Duke of Buckingham did not experience an instant of	132.93833923339844
28393/28840	One of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of	525.5740356445312
28394/28840	Brave rash and enterprising this was not the first time he had risked his life in such	124.78490447998047
28395/28840	The queen had at first positively refused but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some	428.825439453125
28396/28840	She had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision M	383.20233154296875

28398/28840	For two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense but once free and placed in communication with Laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days	276.3526916503906
28399/28840	Buckingham left alone walked toward a	5123.36083984375
28400/28840	At thirtyfive which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or	242.58242797851562
28401/28840	It was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud Anne of Austria and in making himself loved by dazzling	247.26966857910156
28402/28840	At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman	53.499088287353516
28403/28840	Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a	512.9222412109375
28404/28840	It was the queen   Anne of Austria was then twentysix or twentyseven years of age that is to say she was in the full splendor of her	39.77555465698242
28405/28840	Her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and	152.6249542236328
28406/28840	Her mouth was small and rosy and although her underlip like that of all princes of the House of Austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its	878.3261108398438

28413/28840	Besides I have lost nothing by this journey because I see	82.5452651977539
28414/28840	Yes replied Anne but you know why and how I see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my	115.74372863769531
28415/28840	I see you to tell you that everything separates usthe depths of the sea the enmity of kingdoms the sanctity of	382.13848876953125

28420/28840	My Lord cried the queen you forget that I have never said that I love	55.14970016479492

28422/28840	Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet Mark I see you	665.134033203125

28426/28840	Every time I see you is a fresh diamond which I enclose in the casket of my	91.2719497680664
28427/28840	Duke said the queen blushing never speak of that	126.70291137695312
28428/28840	Then you were about to tell me allthe isolation of your life the griefs of your	126.78467559814453
28429/28840	You leaned upon my armupon this madame I felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me I trembled from head to	376.907470703125
28430/28840	Oh Queen Queen You do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like	903.0272216796875
28431/28840	Take my wealth my fortune my glory all the days I have to live for such an instant for a night like	156.83717346191406
28432/28840	For that night madame that night you loved me I will swear	104.29067993164062
28433/28840	At the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which I had to reply I called for	248.62705993652344
28434/28840	And any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal but my love came out from it more ardent and more	993.4906005859375
28435/28840	You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris you believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to	96.10181427001953
28436/28840	What to me were all the treasures in the world or all the kings of the earth Eight days after I was back again mad	149.6219024658203
28437/28840	That time you had nothing to say to me I had risked my life and favor to see you but for a	54.46567916870117
28438/28840	I did not even touch your hand and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repent	217.83242797851562
28439/28840	Yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no part as you well know my	126.3089370727539
28440/28840	The king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clam	524.4502563476562

28445/28840	I have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to Paris I know that	123.29031372070312
28446/28840	But this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be	2144.820556640625

28448/28840	All these proofs of love which you would give me are almost	214.0032501220703
28449/28840	Because you do not love me madame If you loved me you would view all this	128.1067352294922

28457/28840	And the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and	99.37388610839844
28458/28840	Oh my God cried Anne of Austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to	71.95689392089844
28459/28840	I do not tell you this madame to terrify you no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me I take no heed of such	82.2470932006836

28476/28840	Anne of Austria reentered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding a rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with	147.96981811523438
28477/28840	Here my Lord here said she keep this in memory of	645.7772827148438
28478/28840	Buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his	327.44677734375

28480/28840	Your hand madame your hand and I depart   Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon Estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail	199.43966674804688
28481/28840	Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said Within six months if I am not dead I shall have seen you again madameeven if I have to overturn the	304.7200012207031
28482/28840	And faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the	54.63442611694336

28487/28840	The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their musk	286.22900390625
28488/28840	Thence introduced into a halfsubterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest	732.9541625976562
28489/28840	The officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very	122.70364379882812
28490/28840	At the end of half an hour or thereabouts a clerk came to put an end to his tortures but not to his anxiety by giving the order to conduct	141.50491333007812
28491/28840	Ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells but they did not do so with	808.9895629882812
28492/28840	The commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the	70.64484405517578
28493/28840	The two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear	57.36425018310547
28494/28840	The commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do	94.46791076660156
28495/28840	This commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the	971.8823852539062
28496/28840	His head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his	382.3751220703125
28497/28840	Bonacieux his name age condition and ab	378.29205322265625
28498/28840	The accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux that he was fiftyone years old a retired mercer and lived Rue des Fossoyeurs	1179.534423828125
28499/28840	The commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public	219.10826110839844
28500/28840	He complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to comedeeds and power which none could thwart with	1772.1064453125
28501/28840	After this second part of his discourse fixing his hawks eye upon poor Bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his	619.343994140625
28502/28840	The reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when	1600.9189453125
28503/28840	Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady of the Linen to her	2136.50048828125
28504/28840	Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme coward	518.3842163085938
28505/28840	The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumer	296.2475891113281
28506/28840	Bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to	84.5175552368164
28507/28840	But Monsieur Commissary said he calmly believe that I know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be	194.3113250732422
28508/28840	Indeed asked the commissary with an air of	48.25737762451172
28509/28840	You must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high	139.50344848632812
28510/28840	Of high treason cried Bonacieux terrified of high treason How is it possible for a poor mercer who detests Huguenots and who abhors Spaniards to be accused of high treason Consider monsieur the thing is absolutely	900.8729248046875
28511/28840	What you _had_ one What have you done with her then if you have her no longer   They have abducted her monsie	232.1449432373047
28512/28840	They have abducted her Ah   Bonacieux inferred from this Ah that the affair grew more and more	2686.44384765625
28513/28840	They have abducted her added the commissary and do you know the man who has committed this deed   I think I know	119.84441375732422
28514/28840	Who is he   Remember that I affirm nothing Monsieur the Commissary and that I only	154.82315063476562
28515/28840	Whom do you suspect Come answer	3265.251708984375
28516/28840	Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity	106.14999389648438
28517/28840	Had he better deny everything or tell everything By denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow by confessing all he might prove his good	466.4819641113281

28521/28840	Oh as to his name I know nothing about it but if I were ever to meet him I should recognize him in an instant I will answer for it were he among a thousand	60.63566207885742
28522/28840	The face of the commissary grew still	90.67236328125
28523/28840	You should recognize him among a thousand say you continued	315.1445007324219
28524/28840	That is to say cried Bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say   You have answered that you should recognize him said the commiss	64.21416473388672
28525/28840	That is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your	167.4385528564453
28526/28840	But I have not told you that I know him cried Bonacieux in	68.98477172851562
28527/28840	I told you on the contrary   Take away the prisoner said the commissary to the two	33.47745895385742
28528/28840	Where must we place him demanded the	397.61480712890625
28529/28840	Which   Good Lord In the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with	323.4407958984375
28530/28840	Alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful	229.2728271484375
28531/28840	They believe me her accomplice and will punish me with	241.0357666015625

28533/28840	Bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so	67.79241180419922
28534/28840	He sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal t	304.83843994140625
28535/28840	All at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified	700.3405151367188
28536/28840	He believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them	73.82041931152344
28537/28840	Your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and I advise you to tell the whole truth for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the	125.12882995605469
28538/28840	Why I am ready to tell everything cried Bonacieux at least all that I	86.15633392333984

28540/28840	Oh unfortunate creature Monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault I	69.87533569335938
28541/28840	What was the aim of that visit   To beg him to assist me in finding my	125.18355560302734
28542/28840	I believed I had a right to endeavor to find	71.44183349609375
28543/28840	I was deceived as it appears and I ask your	65.53721618652344
28544/28840	And what did Monsieur dArtagnan reply   Monsieur dArtagnan promised me his assistance but I soon found out that he was betraying	35.80685043334961
28545/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond	208.38104248046875

28547/28840	By my faith I ask no better cried Bonacieux I shall not be sorry to see the face of an	78.56995391845703

28549/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan said the commissary addressing Athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and Monsie	42.91133499145508
28550/28840	But cried Bonacieux this is not Monsieur dArtagnan whom you show	38.42403793334961
28551/28840	What Not Monsieur dArtagnan exclaimed the commiss	15.991861343383789
28552/28840	Not the least in the world replied Bonacie	142.97152709960938
28553/28840	What is this gentlemans name asked the commiss	67.11902618408203
28554/28840	I cannot tell you I dont know	21.508281707763672
28555/28840	How You dont know him  	36.69347381591797
28556/28840	Did you never see him   Yes I have seen him but I dont know what he calls	19.883481979370117
28557/28840	But that is not a mans name that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his	73.04795837402344
28558/28840	That is my name said Athos	65.15696716308594
28559/28840	But you said that your name was DArtagn	31.637399673461914
28560/28840	Somebody said to me You are Monsieur dArtagnan I answered You think so My guards exclaimed that they were sure of	87.61229705810547
28561/28840	I did not wish to contradict them besides I might be	52.400001525878906
28562/28840	Monsieur you insult the majesty of	174.70774841308594
28563/28840	You see monsieur that you say it	48.136436462402344
28564/28840	But I tell you Monsieur Commissary cried Bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the	75.13699340820312
28565/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rentand even better on that account ought I to know	118.55775451660156
28566/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at	52.25790023803711
28567/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is in Monsieur Dessessarts Guards and this gentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Trévilles Musket	146.9616241455078
28568/28840	Look at his uniform Monsieur Commissary look at his uniform   Thats true murmured the commissary _pardieu_ thats	70.64845275878906
28569/28840	At this moment the door was opened quickly and a messenger introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille gave a letter to the commiss	65.87832641601562
28570/28840	How What do you say Of whom do you speak It is not of my wife I hope   On the contrary it is of	49.13926315307617
28571/28840	The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux Let them be guarded more closely than	173.3913116455078
28572/28840	And yet said Athos with his habitual calmness if it be Monsieur dArtagnan who is concerned in this matter I do not perceive how I can take his	26.40797233581543
28573/28840	Do as I bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute	310.6073913574219
28574/28840	You understand   Athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while	74.95488739013672
28575/28840	Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a	125.50875091552734
28576/28840	They locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the	144.7436981201172
28577/28840	Bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed	439.9161376953125
28578/28840	In the evening about nine oclock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his	39.66187286376953
28579/28840	These steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards	86.90823364257812
28580/28840	Follow me said an officer who came up behind the	180.4861297607422
28581/28840	Follow you cried Bonacieux follow you at this hour Where my God   Where we have orders to lead	198.75755310058594
28582/28840	It is nevertheless the only one we can	192.9085235595703
28583/28840	Ah my God my God murmured the poor mercer now indeed I am lost And he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without	322.4419860839844
28584/28840	He passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horse	145.7157745361328
28585/28840	They made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling	155.68063354492188
28586/28840	The carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral	443.965576171875
28587/28840	Through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all but true Parisian as he was Bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the	488.4550476074219
28588/28840	At the moment of arriving at	200.0459747314453
28589/28840	Paulthe spot where such as were condemned at the Bastille were executedhe was near fainting and crossed himself	443.32818603515625
28590/28840	He thought the carriage was about to stop	87.3305892944336
28591/28840	Farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of	308.73516845703125
28592/28840	One thing however reassured him he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his	115.24868774414062
28593/28840	But when he saw the carriage take the way to La Grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the Hôtel de Ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with	90.5007095336914
28594/28840	He wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his	196.43585205078125
28595/28840	If they meant to execute him at La Grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of	277.02252197265625
28596/28840	Indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without	229.56668090820312
28597/28840	There remained then no other place to fear but the Traitors Cross the carriage was taking the direct road to	1215.35302734375
28598/28840	This time there was no longer any doubt it was at the Traitors Cross that lesser criminals were	1325.8687744140625
28599/28840	Bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of	98.72126770019531
28600/28840	Paul or of the Place de Grêve it was at the Traitors Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end He could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet	311.9934997558594
28601/28840	When he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage	55.60795974731445
28602/28840	This was more than poor Bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and f	102.10184478759766
28603/28840	THE MAN OF MEUNG     The crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was	453.74945068359375
28604/28840	The carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the Rue	313.15325927734375
28605/28840	Honoré turned into the Rue des Bons Enfants and stopped before a low	73.62158966064453
28606/28840	The door opened two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported	204.29067993164062
28607/28840	They carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antech	91.25750732421875
28608/28840	All these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was	312.6298522949219
28609/28840	He had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a	274.4834899902344
28610/28840	His ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore	212.4503631591797
28611/28840	He remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed	73.69766998291016
28612/28840	At this movement which nobody opposed he resumed a little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the	216.20652770996094
28613/28840	At length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his	55.86184310913086
28614/28840	At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the	91.34696960449219
28615/28840	Yes Monsieur Officer stammered the mercer more dead than alive at your	220.31663513183594
28616/28840	And he moved out of the way to let the mercer	518.0322875976562
28617/28840	The latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be	64.40116119384766
28618/28840	It was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of	168.65228271484375
28619/28840	A square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of La Rochelle occupied the center of the	347.6181945800781
28620/28840	Although this man was scarcely thirtysix or thirtyseven years of age hair mustaches and royal all began to be	347.4739990234375
28621/28840	This man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the	82.98411560058594
28622/28840	At first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they	79.07012176513672
28623/28840	The poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the	108.67826080322266
28624/28840	Is this that Bonacieux asked he after a moment of	154.03912353515625
28625/28840	Give me those papers and leave	496.61151123046875
28626/28840	The officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and	118.18133544921875
28627/28840	Bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the Bast	160.6513671875

28629/28840	At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was	228.35894775390625
28630/28840	That head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will	197.82733154296875
28631/28840	You are accused of high treason said the cardinal	209.2237548828125
28632/28840	So I have been told already monseigneur cried Bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but I swear to you that I know nothing about	74.62454223632812
28633/28840	You have conspired with your wife with Madame de Chevreuse and with my Lord Duke of	99.66130828857422
28634/28840	Indeed monseigneur responded the mercer I have heard her pronounce all those	412.8213806152344
28635/28840	And on what occasion   She said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of Buckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the	59.92400360107422
28636/28840	She said that cried the cardinal with	231.72193908691406
28637/28840	Yes monseigneur but I told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his Eminence was incapable   Hold your tongue You are stupid replied the	78.66866302490234
28638/28840	Thats exactly what my wife said monseign	184.48118591308594
28639/28840	Do you know who carried off your wife   No monseign	41.44388961791992
28640/28840	You have suspicions nevertheless   Yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to Monsieur the Commissary and I no longer have	75.49137878417969
28641/28840	Did you know that   No monseign	14.204034805297852
28642/28840	I learned it since I have been in prison and that from the conversation of Monsieur the Commissaryan amiable	107.38189697265625
28643/28840	Then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her	107.38778686523438
28644/28840	Absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the Lou	47.26370620727539
28645/28840	At one oclock this morning she had not	60.707496643066406
28646/28840	My God What can have become of her then   We shall know be	75.47471618652344
28647/28840	Nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows	170.45065307617188
28648/28840	But monseigneur I know nothing about them I have never seen	26.889122009277344
28649/28840	When you went to fetch your wife from the Louvre did you always return directly home   Scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses I conducted	302.7957458496094
28650/28840	And how many were there of these linen drapers   Two monseign	207.01048278808594
28651/28840	And where did they live   One in Rue de Vaugirard the other Rue de la Har	111.33684539794922
28652/28840	Did you go into these houses with her   Never monseigneur I waited at the	48.57598876953125
28653/28840	And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone   She gave me none she told me to wait and I	196.35008239746094
28654/28840	You are a very complacent husband my dear Monsieur Bonacieux said the	50.152618408203125
28655/28840	He calls me his dear Monsieur said the mercer to	207.9814910888672

28659/28840	At these words he took up a silver bell and rang it the officer	122.46054077148438
28660/28840	Go said he in a subdued voice and find Roche	140.61154174804688

28662/28840	The count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your Eminence	371.6813659667969
28663/28840	Let him come in then said the cardinal	120.67411804199219
28664/28840	The officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying	103.18714141845703

28666/28840	Five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage	118.3045883178711

28668/28840	No monseigneur no it is not he cried Bonacieux no I was	80.7996826171875
28669/28840	This is quite another man and does not resemble him at	102.11756896972656

28674/28840	The queen and the duke cried Richel	67.8554458618164
28675/28840	Are you sure of it   Perfectly	36.61839294433594
28676/28840	Who told you of it   Madame de Lannoy who is devoted to your Eminence as you	158.58290100097656
28677/28840	Why did she not let me know sooner   Whether by chance or mistrust the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all	474.3811950683594
28678/28840	Well we are beaten Now let us try to take our	103.9634780883789
28679/28840	I will assist you with all my heart monseigneur be assured of	30.9664249420166
28680/28840	How did it come about   At half past twelve the queen was with her women   Where   In her bedchamber   Go	107.12940216064453
28681/28840	When someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laund	226.33692932128906
28682/28840	And then   The queen immediately exhibited strong emotion and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale   And then and then   She then arose and with altered voice Ladies said she wait for me ten minutes I shall soon	376.6250305175781
28683/28840	She then opened the door of her alcove and went	91.43656921386719
28684/28840	Why did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly   Nothing was certain besides her Majesty had said Ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the	528.3305053710938
28685/28840	How long did the queen remain out of the chamber   Threequarters of an	89.37237548828125
28686/28840	None of her women accompanied her   Only Donna Estaf	38750.33203125
28687/28840	Did she afterward return   Yes but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again	194.56155395507812
28688/28840	And when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her  	274.94024658203125
28689/28840	Does Madame de Lannoy know what was in that casket   Yes the diamond studs which his Majesty gave the	544.5341186523438
28690/28840	And she came back without this casket  	127.31246185302734
28691/28840	Madame de Lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to Buckingham   She is sure of	379.0227966308594
28692/28840	How can she be so   In the course of the day Madame de Lannoy in her quality of tirewoman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the	364.5188293457031
28693/28840	And then the queen   The queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be	291.6812438964844
28694/28840	He must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or	235.6414337158203
28695/28840	And the goldsmith   The goldsmith has heard nothing of	850.3462524414062
28696/28840	Well well Rochefort all is not lost and perhapsperhaps everything is for the	164.3570556640625
28697/28840	The fact is that I do not doubt your Eminences genius   Will repair the blunders of his agentis that it   That is exactly what I was going to say if your Eminence had let me finish my	203.68197631835938
28698/28840	Meanwhile do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of Buckingham are now concealed   No monseigneur my people could tell me nothing on that	72.90153503417969
28699/28840	You monseigneur   Yes or at least I	18.910648345947266
28700/28840	They were one in the Rue de Vaugirard	71.4736328125
28701/28840	25 the other in the Rue de la Harpe	217.76388549804688
28702/28840	Does your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested   It will be too late they will be	135.8807373046875
28703/28840	But still we can make sure that they are	100.35353088378906
28704/28840	Take ten men of my Guardsmen and search the two houses	2332.415283203125
28705/28840	And Rochefort went hastily out of the	92.71073150634766
28706/28840	The cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third	139.73794555664062
28707/28840	Bring the prisoner in again said the	217.51182556152344
28708/28840	Bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer	85.66294860839844
28709/28840	You have deceived me said the cardinal stern	196.38743591308594
28710/28840	I cried Bonacieux I deceive your Eminence   Your wife in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe did not go to find linen drap	268.2904357910156
28711/28840	Then why did she go just God   She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of	121.92705535888672
28712/28840	Yes cried Bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes thats	201.07615661621094
28713/28840	I told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those in houses that had no signs but she always laughed at	397.7623291015625
28714/28840	The cardinal has touched me with his hand I have touched the hand of the great man cried Bonacie	97.94666290283203
28715/28840	The great man has called me his friend   Yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemn	142.2412109375
28716/28840	Here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon	75.0597152709961
28717/28840	I pardon you monseigneur said Bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasant	182.77447509765625
28718/28840	But you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged you are the master and I could not have the least word to	119.09120178222656
28719/28840	Pardon you monseigneur You cannot mean that   Ah my dear Monsieur Bonacieux you are generous in this	45.145755767822266
28720/28840	I see it and I thank you for	23.371957778930664
28721/28840	Thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too mal	436.8749694824219
28722/28840	Farewell then or rather _au revoir_ for I hope we shall meet	298.2594299316406
28723/28840	Whenever Monseigneur wishes I am always at at his Eminences	393.62213134765625
28724/28840	That will be frequently I assure you for I have found something extremely agreeable in your	118.41260528564453
28725/28840	Oh Monseigneur   _Au revoir_ Monsieur Bonacieux _au revoir_   And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which Bonacieux replied by bowing to the	50.78504180908203
28726/28840	Bonacieux and then when Bonacieuxs cries were no longer audible Good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for	117.24833679199219
28727/28840	As he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and Rochefort	123.4896011352539
28728/28840	Well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the	78.49700927734375
28729/28840	Well said the latter a young woman of about twentysix or twentyeight years of age and a man of from thirtyfive to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence but the woman left last night and the man this	133.62925720214844
28730/28840	It was they cried the cardinal looking at the clock and now it is too late to have them	78.18064880371094
28731/28840	The duchess is at Tours and the duke at Boulog	44.84576416015625
28732/28840	It is in London they must be	128.92262268066406
28733/28840	What are your Eminences orders   Not a word of what has	232.27383422851562
28734/28840	Let the queen remain in perfect security let her be ignorant that we know her	299.881591796875
28735/28840	Let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or	93.47834014892578
28736/28840	Send me the keeper of the seals Ségu	315.6865539550781
28737/28840	And that man what has your Eminence done with him   What man asked the	123.12674713134766
28738/28840	I have done with him all that could be	37.7365837097168
28739/28840	I have made him a spy upon his	60.49167251586914
28740/28840	The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and	129.00619506835938
28741/28840	Left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special	219.24789428710938
28742/28840	The officer entered for the fourth	177.05404663085938
28743/28840	Tell Vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a	134.93714904785156
28744/28840	An instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and	923.6356201171875
28745/28840	Vitray said he you will go with all speed to	150.41915893554688
28746/28840	You must not stop an instant on the	85.89019775390625
28747/28840	You will deliver this letter to Mil	126.99439239501953
28748/28840	Here is an order for two hundred pistoles call upon my treasurer and get the	187.4311981201172
28749/28840	You shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission	202.97091674804688
28750/28840	The messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and	76.07759094238281
28751/28840	Here is what the letter contained   MILADY Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be	1241.7496337890625
28752/28840	He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs get as near to him as you can and cut off	488.7889404296875
28753/28840	As soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform	349.4822998046875
28754/28840	MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD     On the day after these events had taken place Athos not having reappeared	12490.73046875
28755/28840	de Tréville was informed by DArtagnan and Porthos of the	19.501672744750977
28756/28840	As to Aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to Rouen on family	171.1083221435547
28757/28840	de Tréville was the father of his	74.75991821289062
28758/28840	The lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own	106.55183410644531
28759/28840	He repaired then instantly to the office of the _lieutenantcriminel	3141.000732421875
28760/28840	The officer who commanded the post of the Red Cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos was then lodged in Fort lEvê	781.0567626953125
28761/28840	Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux	594.0887451171875
28762/28840	We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each	197.03700256347656
28763/28840	Athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that DArtagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was Athos and not DArtagn	62.6419677734375
28764/28840	He added that he did not know either	69.59614562988281
28765/28840	Bonacieux that he had never spoken to the one or the other that he had come at about ten oclock in the evening to pay a visit to his friend	28.26238441467285
28766/28840	dArtagnan but that till that hour he had been at	63.44084167480469
28767/28840	Twenty witnesses added he could attest the fact and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was	1207.2379150390625
28768/28840	de la Trémouille commanded a little	1365.270263671875
28769/28840	Athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the Louvre with the	53.31639862060547
28770/28840	It was precisely at this moment that	90.31732177734375
28771/28840	de Tréville on leaving the residence of the _lieutenantcriminel_ and the governor of Fort lEvêque without being able to find Athos arrived at the	235.24905395507812
28772/28840	de Tréville had the right of entry at all	84.68791961669922
28773/28840	It is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than	420.2655944824219
28774/28840	One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of Austria for M	289.6641540527344
28775/28840	These two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with Spain the quarrel with England or the embarrassment of the	187.65817260742188
28776/28840	In his eyes and to his conviction M	489.2205505371094
28777/28840	de Chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrig	168.89024353027344
28778/28840	At the first word the cardinal spoke of M	408.6793518066406
28779/28840	de Chevreusewho though exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city had come to Paris remained there five days and outwitted the policethe king flew into a furious	1076.2364501953125
28780/28840	Capricious and unfaithful the king wished to be called Louis the Just and Louis the Ch	581.791259765625
28781/28840	Posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by	1713.4288330078125
28782/28840	But when the cardinal added that not only M	486.89263916015625
28783/28840	could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queens apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless	267.2242126464844
28784/28840	And yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of	92.74800872802734
28785/28840	de Tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable	654.85205078125
28786/28840	Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the kings countenance	155.33828735351562
28787/28840	de Tréville felt himself something like Samson before the Philist	1969.021240234375
28788/28840	had already placed his hand on the knob of the door at the noise of	62.585567474365234
28789/28840	You arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble I have learned some fine things concerning your Musket	202.21334838867188
28790/28840	And I said Tréville coldly I have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gowns	397.55108642578125
28791/28840	I have the honor to inform your Majesty continued	205.04537963867188
28792/28840	Athos said the king mechanically yes certainly I know that	218.11546325683594
28793/28840	Let your Majesty remember said Tréville that Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so	209.99368286132812
28794/28840	_A propos_ monseigneur continued Tréville addressing the cardinal Monsieur de Cahusac is quite recovered is he not   Thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with	131.0992431640625
28795/28840	We all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our	121.22264099121094
28796/28840	A written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his Majesty and the illtreated people have drawn up the following which I have the honor to present to your	405.3816223144531
28797/28840	And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman replied Tréville haught	145.02120971679688
28798/28840	Come come Tréville hold your tongue said the	380.4048156738281
28799/28840	If his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my Musketeers said Tréville the justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so well known that I demand an	114.42790985107422
28800/28840	In the house in which the judicial inquiry was made continued the impassive cardinal there lodges I believe a young Béarnais a friend of the Musket	351.7845764160156
28801/28840	I mean a young man whom you patronize Monsieur de Tré	22.29818344116211
28802/28840	Yes your Eminence it is the	139.00875854492188
28803/28840	Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel   To Athos to a man double his age interrupted Tré	141.34629821777344
28804/28840	Besides DArtagnan passed the evening with	55.21208190917969
28805/28840	Well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with	117.25347900390625
28806/28840	Does your Eminence doubt my word said Tréville with a brow flushed with	409.018798828125
28807/28840	At what hour did he leave your hôtel   At half past tenan hour after the	248.23435974121094
28808/28840	Well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of Tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but Athos _was_ taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoye	106.44017028808594
28809/28840	Is one friend forbidden to visit another or a Musketeer of my company to fraternize with a Guard of Dessessarts company   Yes when the house where he fraternizes is	1796.7210693359375
28810/28840	That house is suspected Tréville said the king perhaps you did not know it   Indeed sire I did	72.4596939086914
28811/28840	Was it not this DArtagnan who wounded Jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the CarmesDéchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vex	487.3544006347656
28812/28840	Yes sire yes it is the same and your Majesty has a good	121.3570556640625
28813/28840	Come how shall we decide said the	77.02176666259766
28814/28840	That concerns your Majesty more than me said the	290.4939270019531
28815/28840	But his Majesty has judges and these judges will	3783.63525390625
28816/28840	Send the case before the judges it is their business to judge and they shall	229.34957885742188
28817/28840	Only replied Tréville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue cannot exempt a man from infamy and	247.11865234375
28818/28840	The army I will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police	289.5750732421875
28819/28840	de Tréville launched it with knowledge of his	516.916748046875
28820/28840	He was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlight	327.97308349609375
28821/28840	Police affairs cried the king taking up Trévilles words police affairs And what do you know about them Monsieur Meddle with your Musketeers and do not annoy me in this	299.4503479003906
28822/28840	It appears according to your account that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested France is in	224.51560974121094
28823/28840	What a noise about a Musketeer I would arrest ten of them _ventrebleu_ a hundred even all the company and I would not allow a	206.04261779785156
