72/3605	He was Des Roches le Masle canon of Notre Dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his Eminence as a perfectly devout	819.6492919921875
73/3605	The cardinal trusted him and therein found his	1338.3624267578125
74/3605	There are many stories related of him and among them	369.1888732910156
75/3605	After a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to expiate at least for some time the follies of	320.09417724609375
76/3605	On entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with	243.743896484375
77/3605	At the denunciating sound the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother and all the community would go to	6176.94189453125
78/3605	This advice appeared good to the future	3445.32177734375

81/3605	In proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent	679.3064575195312

84/3605	It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible _possessed_ that ever	119.9942398071289

89/3605	For forms sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that	142.0349578857422
90/3605	When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experienceit became necessary I say to come to the conclusion of the affair that is to say to search the queen	227.56640625
91/3605	The chancellor advanced therefore toward Anne of Austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air And now it remains for me to make the principal	211.02284240722656
92/3605	What is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to	56.83584976196289

101/3605	I will give it to none but the king monsieur said	32.55184555053711
102/3605	If the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you	84.83661651611328
103/3605	But I repeat to you I am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up   Well   He has then charged me to take it from	57.27779769897461

105/3605	Be kind enough then madame to act more compliant	1618.959228515625

107/3605	I will not suffer it No no I would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to	150.62127685546875
108/3605	The queen was as we have said of great	170.2703094482422
109/3605	The commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of Buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone	246.58309936523438
110/3605	Without doubt the chancellor Séguier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell but not finding it he summoned his resolution and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be	111.80464172363281
111/3605	There monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious	86.18501281738281
112/3605	The chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and	183.17564392089844
113/3605	The door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her	105.6023178100586
114/3605	The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of	79.99897766113281
115/3605	The king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of Spain he read it	125.63922882080078
116/3605	It was nothing but a plan of attack against the	118.95992279052734
117/3605	The king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the Louvre he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty in the business	209.70718383789062
118/3605	There Duke said he you were right and I was	64.04444885253906
119/3605	The whole intrigue is political and there is not the least question of love in this letter but on the other hand there is abundant question of	228.4458465576172
120/3605	The cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention then when he had arrived at the end of it he read it a second	33.6114616394043
121/3605	Well your Majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss	673.828857421875
122/3605	In your place in truth sire I should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public	152.39239501953125
123/3605	What say you Duke   I say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these neverending lab	761.07958984375
124/3605	You would be the happier for it at home sire and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it	129.36903381347656
125/3605	Monsieur Duke said the king I understand	89.36202239990234
126/3605	Be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen	197.60360717773438
127/3605	That is true Monsieur Cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my	125.81471252441406
128/3605	It is you sire who have now incurred	493.3301086425781
129/3605	The queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable	112.30020141601562
130/3605	Allow me then sire to intercede for her with your	292.26275634765625
131/3605	Let her humble herself then and come to me	320.6526794433594
132/3605	On the contrary sire set the	331.6202087402344
133/3605	You have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the	167.45668029785156
134/3605	What I make the first advances said the	68.61700439453125
135/3605	Never   Sire I entreat you to do	11.990599632263184
136/3605	Besides in what manner can I make advances first   By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to	180.29989624023438
137/3605	What is that   Give a ball you know how much the queen loves	138.93447875976562
138/3605	I will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an	192.5009002685547
139/3605	Monsieur Cardinal you know that I do not like worldly	419.68603515625
140/3605	Sire said the cardinal leave severity to your	770.5064086914062
141/3605	Clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage	737.7684936523438
142/3605	Thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the	181.572998046875
143/3605	Anne of Austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with	487.50848388671875
144/3605	Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to	343.9620666503906
145/3605	The king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fê	134.6553497314453
146/3605	A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her count	103.86809539794922
147/3605	She asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that	192.2744140625
148/3605	Indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing	227.85643005371094
149/3605	On the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these lines I have them but I am unable to leave London for want of	138.40707397460938
150/3605	Send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after I have received them I shall be in	35.666351318359375
151/3605	On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to	178.6413116455078
152/3605	Richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself She will arrive she says four or five days after having received the	164.9802703857422
153/3605	It will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return that makes ten	190.98272705078125
154/3605	Now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a womans weakness there are twelve	1483.342041015625
155/3605	Well Monsieur Duke said the king have you made your calculations   Yes s	72.8917007446289
156/3605	The aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of	714.947998046875
157/3605	That will fall in wonderfully well you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the	129.3829803466797
158/3605	Then the cardinal added _A propos_ sire do not forget to tell her Majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become	233.89251708984375
159/3605	BONACIEUX AT HOME     It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the	3814.867431640625
160/3605	was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some	994.8074951171875
161/3605	More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own	202.9145965576172
162/3605	He went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded	174.33816528320312
163/3605	Anne of Austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself but this was not what Louis	432.85986328125
164/3605	wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was so skillful in getting	319.22503662109375
165/3605	He arrived at this end by his persistence in	1972.469970703125
166/3605	But cried Anne of Austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your	93.65005493164062
167/3605	What have I done then Let me know what crime I have	88.9326400756836
168/3605	It is impossible that your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my	1083.2003173828125
169/3605	The king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fê	83.71755981445312
170/3605	Madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the Hôtel de V	48.082908630371094
171/3605	I wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which I gave you on your	725.2361450195312
172/3605	Anne of Austria believed that Louis	447.4167175292969
173/3605	knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was	305.65045166015625
174/3605	She became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a _console_ which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syll	290.0956726074219
175/3605	You hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the	153.45460510253906
176/3605	You hear madame   Yes sire I hear stammered the	37.29086685180664
177/3605	You will appear at this ball  	61.14309310913086
178/3605	The queens paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his	293.5716552734375
179/3605	Then that is agreed said the king and that is all I had to say to	39.75242233276367
180/3605	But on what day will this ball take place asked Anne of	229.48129272460938
181/3605	felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying	111.86730194091797
182/3605	Oh very shortly madame said he but I do not precisely recollect the date of the	82.62626647949219
183/3605	Then you will appear   Yes s	44.86659240722656
184/3605	That is well said the king retiring that is well I count upon	198.1166534423828
185/3605	The queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under	3248.392822265625
186/3605	I am lost murmured the queen lostfor the cardinal knows all and it is he who urges on the king who as yet knows nothing but will soon know	179.9801025390625
187/3605	I am lost My God my God my God   She knelt upon a cushion and prayed with her head buried between her palpitating	147.5647430419922
188/3605	More closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed	254.83969116210938
189/3605	Laporte could not leave the Louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could conf	51.37763977050781
190/3605	Thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and	427.1275634765625
191/3605	Can I be of service to your Majesty said all at once a voice full of sweetness and	329.6381530761719
192/3605	The queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke	230.01394653320312
193/3605	In fact at one of the doors which opened into the queens apartment appeared the pretty M	309.4566345214844
194/3605	She had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard	130.63229370117188
195/3605	The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprisedfor in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laport	122.6445083618164
196/3605	You oh heaven you cried the queen but look me in the	284.93408203125
197/3605	Can I trust in you   Oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul I am ready to die for your Majesty   This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking	53.439579010009766
198/3605	Bonacieux yes there are traitors here but by the holy name of the Virgin I swear that no one is more devoted to your Majesty than I	102.07099151611328
199/3605	Bonacieux we must have them back	46.06117630004883
200/3605	Yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am I to act How can it be effected   Someone must be sent to the d	72.2341537475586
201/3605	But who who In whom can I trust   Place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and I will find a	188.3928985595703
202/3605	Two words from the hand of your Majesty and your private	575.1906127929688
203/3605	But these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile   Yes if they fell into infamous	960.254150390625
204/3605	But I will answer for these two words being delivered to their	141.21083068847656
205/3605	Oh my God I must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands   Yes yes madame you must and I will save them	73.54320526123047
206/3605	But how Tell me at least the	162.5160675048828
207/3605	My husband had been at liberty these two or three	55.876869201660156
208/3605	I have not yet had time to see him	30.779640197753906
209/3605	He is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for	190.40687561035156
210/3605	He will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your Majestys letter without even knowing it is from your Majesty to the address which is on	253.45318603515625
211/3605	The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tender	101.08209228515625
212/3605	Do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor   Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your	58.72583770751953
213/3605	I have nothing to save for your Majesty you are only the victim of perfidious	343.5009765625
214/3605	That is true that is true my child said the queen you are	30.253854751586914
215/3605	Give me then that letter madame time	7194.8837890625
216/3605	The queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and	377.7804870605469
217/3605	She wrote two lines sealed the letter with her private seal and gave it to M	598.2587890625
218/3605	And now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary	229.740234375
219/3605	What is that madame  	39.980377197265625
220/3605	Yes that is true said she and I will confess to your Majesty that my husband   Your husband has	61.32853698730469
221/3605	Is that what you would say   He has some but he is very avaricious that is his	63.39379119873047
222/3605	Nevertheless let not your Majesty be uneasy we will find	748.463134765625
223/3605	And I have none either said the	122.96475219726562
224/3605	Those who have read the _Memoirs_ of M	1407.93505859375
225/3605	de Motteville will not be astonished at this	149.0827178955078
226/3605	Anne of Austria ran to her jewel	1250.53076171875
227/3605	Here said she here is a ring of great value as I have been	100.69261932373047
228/3605	It came from my brother the King of	297.8294982910156

231/3605	In an hour you shall be ob	44.7637939453125
232/3605	You see the address said the queen speaking so low that M	414.834716796875
233/3605	Bonacieux could hardly hear what she said To my Lord Duke of Buckingham	279.2357177734375
234/3605	The letter shall be given to	142.86447143554688
235/3605	Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a	49.168861389160156
236/3605	Ten minutes afterward she was at	102.58273315429688
237/3605	As to the servant she had run away at the moment of her masters	82.24223327636719
238/3605	Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy her native	269.2251892089844
239/3605	The worthy mercer had immediately upon reentering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a	588.7885131835938
240/3605	This first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to	339.3815612792969
241/3605	Bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits Rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than	183.69766235351562
242/3605	This was the more so because Bonacieuxs reflections were all rosecol	207.7607421875
243/3605	Rochefort called him his friend his dear Bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for	206.12045288085938
244/3605	The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	395.2525939941406
245/3605	Bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from	757.5816040039062
246/3605	In spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in	131.7821502685547
247/3605	Bonacieux having always lived among her husbands friendspeople little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her positionM	974.4884643554688
248/3605	Bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and DArtagnan was a	205.2424774169922
249/3605	Besides he wore the uniform of the Guards which next to that of the Musketeers was most admired by the	145.3311309814453
250/3605	He was we repeat handsome young and bold he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in	208.39544677734375
251/3605	There was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twentythree years old and M	272.2759094238281
252/3605	Bonacieux had just attained that happy period of	172.15086364746094
253/3605	The couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccup	82.42164611816406
254/3605	Nevertheless Bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open	363.5301208496094
255/3605	Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to	215.12344360351562
256/3605	Let us talk a little said	247.12091064453125
257/3605	Yes I have something of the highest importance to tell	51.93463897705078
258/3605	True said he and I have some questions sufficiently serious to put to	71.86349487304688
259/3605	Describe to me your abduction I pray	390.02947998046875
260/3605	Oh thats of no consequence just now said M	580.9509887695312
261/3605	You speak very much at your ease madame said Bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in	146.02842712402344
262/3605	Do you know that I was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille   Oh a day and night soon pass	119.34712982177734
263/3605	Let us return to the object that brings me	161.0990447998047
264/3605	What that which brings you home to me Is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week asked the mercer piqued to the	141.87277221679688
265/3605	Yes that first and other things	954.5689697265625
266/3605	It is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps	242.12318420410156
267/3605	The complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you Madame Bonacieux and I should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many	111.47064971923828
268/3605	Yes particularly if you follow the instructions I am about to give	87.63874816894531
269/3605	There is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same	85.29688262939453
270/3605	Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak	131.7741241455078
271/3605	But a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu is no longer the same	171.4733428955078
272/3605	Much money to be gained said Bonacieux protruding his	1104.556640625
273/3605	About how much   A thousand pistoles	49.29062271118164
274/3605	What you demand of me is serious then   It is	70.1609878540039
275/3605	What must be done   You must go away	46.44721221923828
276/3605	I will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper	80.12660217285156

278/3605	I go to London Go to You jest I have no business in	212.3142547607422
279/3605	But others wish that you should go	270.86090087890625
280/3605	But who are those others I warn you that I will never again work in the dark and that I will know not only to what I expose myself but for whom I expose	106.28116607666016
281/3605	An illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits	626.4860229492188
282/3605	The recompense will exceed your expectations that is all I promise	278.4030456542969
283/3605	More intrigues Nothing but intrigues Thank you madame I am aware of them now Monsieur Cardinal has enlightened me on that	276.94049072265625
284/3605	Have you seen the cardinal   He sent for me answered the mercer	303.1269836425781
285/3605	And you responded to his bidding you imprudent man   Well I cant say I had much choice of going or not going for I was taken to him between two	133.54624938964844
286/3605	It is true also that as I did not then know his Eminence if I had been able to dispense with the visit I should have been	70.04008483886719
287/3605	He illtreated you then he threatened you   He gave me his hand and called me his	87.73700714111328
288/3605	There are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should	373.91156005859375
289/3605	I am sorry for it madame but I acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom I have the honor to	35.85696792602539
290/3605	You serve the cardinal   Yes madame and as his servant I will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not French and who has a Spanish	65.59233093261719
291/3605	Fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the	701.903076171875
292/3605	Nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her	239.72482299804688
293/3605	Ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen   Private interests are as nothing before the interests of	243.4058074951172
294/3605	I am for those who save the state said Bonacieux	816.0326538085938
295/3605	And what do you know about the state you talk of said M	247.8984375
296/3605	Be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most	1540.245849609375
297/3605	Madame replied Bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious Spaniard and what the cardinal does is well	211.41726684570312
298/3605	Bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her	111.33514404296875
299/3605	You meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics Why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money   No to the	421.2559509277344

303/3605	But what do you require of me then Let us	66.41873168945312
304/3605	You must accomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you and on that condition I pardon everything I forget everything and what is more and she held out her hand to him I restore my	207.96493530273438
305/3605	Bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his	104.382568359375
306/3605	A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of twenty	1134.7344970703125
307/3605	But my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of	330.77642822265625
308/3605	London is far from Paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers   What matters it if you avoid them   Hold Madame Bonacieux said the mercer hold I positively refuse intrigues terrify	319.3325500488281

311/3605	And _morbleu_ why do you not go yourself For in truth I think I have hitherto been deceived in	75.13925170898438
312/3605	I really believe you are a man and a violent one	76.28119659423828

316/3605	Have me arrested on the part of the queen said he and II will appeal to his Emin	98.3014144897461
317/3605	Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so	81.49337768554688
318/3605	She for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by	626.5400390625
319/3605	Perhaps when all is considered you are	142.36070251464844
320/3605	In the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you Monsieur Bonacieux have conversed with the	195.23011779785156
321/3605	And yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection I thought I might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my f	224.3116455078125
322/3605	That is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant Bonacieux and I mistrust	302.5941162109375
323/3605	Well I will give it up then said the young woman sigh	48.894195556640625
324/3605	It is well as it is say no more about	86.55261993408203
325/3605	At least you should tell me what I should have to do in London replied Bonacieux who remembered a little too late that Rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wifes	73.79077911376953
326/3605	It is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw	93.50540161132812
327/3605	It was about one of those purchases that interest womena purchase by which much might have been	628.710693359375
328/3605	But the more the young woman excused herself the more important Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to	256.7464599609375
329/3605	He resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de Rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to	44.404659271240234
330/3605	Pardon me for quitting you my dear Madame Bonacieux said he but not knowing you would come to see me I had made an engagement with a	60.26851272583008
331/3605	I shall soon return and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late I will come back and reconduct you to the Lou	78.21439361572266
332/3605	Thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied M	67.43257904052734
333/3605	I shall return very safely to the Louvre all	316.0843505859375
334/3605	As you please Madame Bonacieux said the exmer	473.798583984375
335/3605	Shall I see you again soon   Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and I will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much der	127.29109954833984
336/3605	You are not angry with me   Not the least in the	18.468475341796875
337/3605	Till then then   Till	2554.59814453125
338/3605	Bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick	56.73820877075195
339/3605	Bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinal	244.31138610839844
340/3605	LOVER AND HUSBAND     Ah Madame said DArtagnan entering by the door which the young woman opened for him allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a	217.2358856201172
341/3605	You have then overheard our conversation asked M	1025.4248046875
342/3605	Bonacieux eagerly and looking at DArtagnan with dis	37.999881744384766
343/3605	But how my God   By a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which I likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinals	160.81207275390625
344/3605	And what did you understand by what we said   A thousand	58.26621627807617
345/3605	I have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here I	110.6595230102539
346/3605	Bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her	106.71769714355469
347/3605	And what guarantee will you give me asked she if I consent to confide this message to you   My love for	187.11819458007812
348/3605	Speak Command What is to be done   My God my God murmured the young woman ought I to confide such a secret to you monsieur You are almost a	67.59418487548828
349/3605	I see that you require someone to answer for me   I admit that would reassure me	118.96383666992188
350/3605	Do you know Athos  	24.98308563232422
351/3605	Who are these gentleman   Three of the kings Musket	126.32815551757812
352/3605	Do you know Monsieur de Tréville their captain   Oh yes him I know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal	58.86149597167969
353/3605	You do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal   Oh no certainly not   Well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to	112.10369873046875
354/3605	But this secret is not mine and I cannot reveal it in this	71.809814453125
355/3605	You were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux said DArtagnan with chag	83.85731506347656
356/3605	As one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a	270.95855712890625
357/3605	And yet meyou see plainly that I love	172.84591674804688
358/3605	Oh I am sure of that   Then put me to the	44.19561004638672
359/3605	Bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in	121.24848175048828
360/3605	Besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of	176.31365966796875
361/3605	The queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence andlet us admit itthe involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to	570.170166015625
362/3605	Listen said she I yield to your protestations I yield to your	314.7770080566406
363/3605	But I swear to you before God who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me I will kill myself while accusing you of my	111.59919738769531
364/3605	And II swear to you before God madame said DArtagnan that if I am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me I will die sooner than do anything that may compromise	97.67484283447266
365/3605	Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the Samarit	268.9504699707031
366/3605	This was their mutual declaration of	748.6552124023438
367/3605	DArtagnan was radiant with joy and	26.406240463256836
368/3605	This secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved Confidence and love made him a	1096.64990234375
369/3605	I go said he I go at	67.25310516357422
370/3605	Bonacieux and your regiment your captain   By my soul you had made me forget all that dear Constance Yes you are right a furlough is need	273.18597412109375
371/3605	As to that cried DArtagnan after a moment of reflection I shall surmount it be	72.75263214111328
372/3605	How so   I will go this very evening to Tréville whom I will request to ask this favor for me of his brotherinlaw Monsieur Dessess	147.22520446777344
373/3605	You have perhaps no money   _Perhaps_ is too much said DArtagnan	113.30264282226562
374/3605	Bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this	209.50367736816406
375/3605	The cardinals cried DArtagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his	213.49810791015625
376/3605	You see it makes a very respectable	676.9234008789062
377/3605	_Pardieu_ cried DArtagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinals money   You are an amiable and charming young man said M	65.82469177246094
378/3605	Be assured you will not find her Majesty ungr	197.89581298828125
379/3605	Oh I am already grandly recompensed cried DArtagn	61.772979736328125
380/3605	I love you you permit me to tell you that I dothat is already more happiness than I dared to	65.5931167602539
381/3605	What   Someone is talking in the	187.2090606689453
382/3605	It is the voice of   Of my husband Yes I recognize it   DArtagnan ran to the door and pushed the	41.87622833251953
383/3605	He shall not come in before I am gone said he and when I am gone you can open to	91.74363708496094
384/3605	But I ought to be gone	69.82907104492188
385/3605	And the disappearance of his money how am I to justify it if I am here   You are right we must go	67.34000396728516
386/3605	Go out How He will see us if we go	243.86607360839844
387/3605	Then you must come up into my	129.28189086914062
388/3605	Bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me   M	73.5489501953125
389/3605	Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her	29.977500915527344
390/3605	DArtagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her	156.47198486328125
391/3605	With me you will be as safe as in a temple I give you my word of a	114.55058288574219
392/3605	Once there for greater security the young man barricaded the	95.2933120727539
393/3605	They both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw Bonacieux talking with a man in a	289.14373779296875
394/3605	At sight of this man DArtagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the	38.97556686401367
395/3605	What are you going to do cried M	153.12539672851562
396/3605	Bonacieux you will ruin us all   But I have sworn to kill that man said DArtagn	21.15074920654297
397/3605	Your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to	83.43492889404297
398/3605	In the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your	118.73352813720703
399/3605	And do you command nothing in your own name   In my name said M	111.68273162841797
400/3605	Bonacieux with great emotion in my name I beg you But listen they appear to be speaking of	108.49588775634766
401/3605	DArtagnan drew near the window and lent his	37.747337341308594
402/3605	Bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an	35.00150680541992
403/3605	She is gone said he she must have returned to the Lou	71.13885498046875
404/3605	You are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out   No replied Bonacieux with a selfsufficient air she is too superficial a	214.17759704589844
405/3605	Is the young Guardsman at home   I do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shut	185.56822204589844
406/3605	All the same it is well to be	97.12092590332031
407/3605	How so   By knocking at his	157.28472900390625
408/3605	Bonacieux reentered the house passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives went up to DArtagnans door and	43.09189987182617
409/3605	Porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed Planc	186.96746826171875
410/3605	As to DArtagnan he took care not to give the least sign of	47.43299102783203
411/3605	The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within	131.67349243164062
412/3605	We shall be safer there than in the	324.1494445800781
413/3605	On the contrary said DArtagnan we shall hear	29.226959228515625
414/3605	DArtagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of Dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to M	162.2386474609375
415/3605	Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the	124.8340072631836
416/3605	You are sure there is nobody there said the	175.6260986328125
417/3605	I will answer for it said Bonacie	63.49916076660156
418/3605	And you think that your wife   Has returned to the Lou	61.41334533691406
419/3605	Without speaking to anyone but yourself   I am sure of	45.2050895690918
420/3605	That is an important point do you understand   Then the news I brought you is of value   The greatest my dear Bonacieux I dont conceal this from	102.4709701538086
421/3605	Then the cardinal will be pleased with me   I have no doubt of	30.108407974243164
422/3605	The great cardinal   Are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names   I think	85.22195434570312
423/3605	She did not name Madame de Chevreuse the Duke of Buckingham or Madame de Vernet   No she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the interests of an illustrious person	115.57784271240234
424/3605	Silence said DArtagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to	73.98491668701172
425/3605	Never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the	155.4282989501953
426/3605	You would then be in present possession of the	66.00951385498047
427/3605	The state which is now threatened would be safe and you   And I   Well youthe cardinal would have given you letters of	119.00525665283203
428/3605	Did he tell you so   Yes I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable	86.87081909179688
429/3605	Be satisfied replied Bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet	488.8915100097656
430/3605	Silence said DArtagnan pressing her hand more	48.14226531982422
431/3605	How is there still time asked the man in the	126.12556457519531
432/3605	I go to the Louvre I ask for M	143.44052124023438
433/3605	Bonacieux I say that I have reflected I renew the affair I obtain the letter and I run directly to the	107.83379364013672
434/3605	Well go quickly I will return soon to learn the result of your	215.54791259765625
435/3605	Bonacieux addressing this epithet to her	136.2083282470703
436/3605	Silence said DArtagnan pressing her hand still more warm	44.830177307128906
437/3605	A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of DArtagnan and M	348.8283386230469
438/3605	It was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying Thieves   Oh my God cried M	255.76622009277344
439/3605	Bonacieux he will rouse the whole	85.07469177246094
440/3605	Now he is gone it is your turn to get out said M	308.13494873046875
441/3605	Courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the	109.84638214111328
442/3605	To her and to you cried DArtagn	36.790836334228516
443/3605	I shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall I likewise return worthy of your love   The young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her	168.356201171875
444/3605	A few seconds afterward DArtagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which illconcealed the sheath of a long	73.02420806884766
445/3605	PLAN OF CAMPAIGN     DArtagnan went straight to	1379.917236328125
446/3605	He had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to	116.06632995605469
447/3605	The heart of the young man overflowed with	62.728614807128906
448/3605	An opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he ad	248.30076599121094
449/3605	This chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of	62.69333267211914
450/3605	de Tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of	185.6971893310547
451/3605	DArtagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of	55.800636291503906
452/3605	DArtagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when	39.96126174926758
453/3605	At the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on	161.02915954589844
454/3605	All the way along DArtagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in	226.77401733398438
455/3605	de Tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him _carte blanche_ for some secret	314.4559326171875
456/3605	de Tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him	85.25361633300781
457/3605	Did you ask for me my good friend said	42.34755325317383
458/3605	Yes monsieur said DArtagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me I hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my	25.310861587524414
459/3605	It concerns nothing less said DArtagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the	64.90335083007812
460/3605	de Tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon DArtagn	78.44480895996094
461/3605	I say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret   Which you will guard I hope young man as your	75.25981140136719
462/3605	But which I must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission I have just received from her	78.29118347167969
463/3605	Is this secret your own   No monsieur it is her Majest	167.09535217285156
464/3605	Are you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me   No monsieur for on the contrary I am desired to preserve the profoundest	109.71075439453125
465/3605	Why then are you about to betray it to me   Because as I said without you I can do nothing and I am afraid you will refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I ask	46.787837982177734
466/3605	Keep your secret young man and tell me what you	56.66891098022461
467/3605	I wish you to obtain for me from Monsieur Dessessart leave of absence for fifteen	242.53871154785156
468/3605	You leave Paris   I am going on a	35.683433532714844
469/3605	May you tell me whither   To	75.05792999267578
470/3605	Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there   The cardinal I believe would give the world to prevent my	146.7317352294922
471/3605	And you are going alone   I am going	39.66380310058594
472/3605	In that case you will not get beyond Bond	1317.0721435546875
473/3605	I tell you so by the faith of de Tré	98.67650604248047
474/3605	How so   You will be	77.00748443603516
475/3605	And I shall die in the performance of my	70.70419311523438
476/3605	But your mission will not be	100.1263427734375
477/3605	Believe me continued Tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set	371.6072998046875
478/3605	Ah you are right monsieur said DArtagnan but you know Athos Porthos and Aramis and you know if I can dispose of	11.090916633605957
479/3605	Without confiding to them the secret which I am not willing to know   We are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all	272.8754577636719
480/3605	Besides you can tell them that you have full confidence in me and they will not be more incredulous than	42.84714126586914
481/3605	Sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their	505.13507080078125
482/3605	You are a hundred times too	65.89529418945312
483/3605	Begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight Ha But first write your request to Dessess	1968.3509521484375
484/3605	Perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem	214.6157684326172
485/3605	DArtagnan drew up his request and	40.25757598876953
486/3605	de Tréville on receiving it assured him that by two oclock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the	112.8827133178711
487/3605	Have the goodness to send mine to Athoss	616.3289794921875
488/3605	I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go	300.54541015625
489/3605	Have you any money   DArtagnan tapped the bag he had in his	60.474365234375
490/3605	Oh plenty That would carry you to the end of the	130.33860778808594
491/3605	Begone then   DArtagnan saluted	39.85319519042969
492/3605	de Tréville who held out his hand to him DArtagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with	43.93233871459961
493/3605	Since his first arrival at Paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and	351.56085205078125
494/3605	His first visit was to Aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed M	164.76100158691406
495/3605	Still further he had seldom seen the young Musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his count	123.03530883789062
496/3605	This evening especially Aramis was melancholy and	361.39886474609375
497/3605	DArtagnan asked some questions about this prolonged	238.82154846191406
498/3605	Augustine which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good	146.575439453125
499/3605	After the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from	102.45064544677734
500/3605	de Tréville entered bringing a sealed	431.9754943847656
501/3605	The leave of absence Monsieur has asked for replied the lac	105.87015533447266
502/3605	For me I have asked for no leave of	162.2206268310547
503/3605	Hold your tongue and take it said DArtagn	25.693923950195312
504/3605	And you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell Monsieur de Tréville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to	31.92892074584961
505/3605	The lackey bowed to the ground and	61.11659240722656
506/3605	What does all this mean asked Aram	57.31965637207031
507/3605	Pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow	99.0628662109375
508/3605	But I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing   Aramis	77.44203186035156
509/3605	What is become of her I suppose you mean continued DArtagn	41.71815872192383
510/3605	The woman who was herethe woman with the embroidered handker	86.78789520263672
511/3605	Who told you there was a woman here replied Aramis becoming as pale as	93.81968688964844
512/3605	And you know who she is   I believe I can guess at	47.58150863647461
513/3605	Since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman   I presume that she has returned to	42.13721466064453
514/3605	But why did she return to Tours without telling me anything   Because she was in fear of being	135.1791534423828
515/3605	Why has she not written to me then   Because she was afraid of compromising	113.6558837890625
516/3605	DArtagnan you restore me to life cried Aram	59.50492477416992
517/3605	I was so delighted to see her again I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris   For the cause which today takes us to	105.97601318359375
518/3605	And what is this cause demanded Aram	205.26283264160156
519/3605	Oh youll know it someday Aramis but at present I must imitate the discretion of the doctors	1118.2388916015625
520/3605	Aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain	170.63575744628906
521/3605	Well then since she has left Paris and you are sure of it DArtagnan nothing prevents me and I am ready to follow	36.34978485107422
522/3605	You say we are going   To see Athos now and if you will come thither I beg you to make haste for we have lost much time	51.91545104980469
523/3605	Will Bazin go with us asked Aram	127.98583984375
524/3605	At all events it is best that he should follow us to Ath	105.89832305908203
525/3605	Aramis called Bazin and after having ordered him to join them at Athoss residence said Let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray	139.42510986328125
526/3605	When well assured this search was superfluous he followed DArtagnan wondering to himself how this young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of	205.8363037109375
527/3605	Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of DArtagnan and looking at him earnestly You have not spoken of this lady said	33.61796951293945
528/3605	Not even to Athos or Porthos   I have not breathed a syllable to	32.08077621459961
529/3605	Good enough   Tranquil on this important point Aramis continued his way with DArtagnan and both soon arrived at Athoss	245.89456176757812
530/3605	They found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and	150.9489288330078
531/3605	Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which I have just received said the astonished Ath	104.38829803466797
532/3605	MY DEAR ATHOS     I wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest     for a	220.71420288085938
533/3605	Go then and take the waters of Forges or any     that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as     quickly as	251.0409698486328
534/3605	Yours affectionate DE TRÉVILLE     Well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me Ath	1041.9256591796875
535/3605	To the waters of Forges   There or	455.7900085449219
536/3605	In the kings service   Either the kings or the	112.44209289550781
537/3605	Are we not their Majesties servants   At that moment Porthos	239.85218811035156
538/3605	_Pardieu_ said he here is a strange thing Since when I wonder in the Musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it   Since said DArtagnan they have friends who ask it for	110.40869140625
539/3605	Ah ah said Porthos it appears theres something fresh	105.19488525390625
540/3605	My faith I dont know much about it said Ath	56.716243743896484
541/3605	To London cried Porthos and what the devil are we going to do in London   That is what I am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to	24.160869598388672
542/3605	But in order to go to London added Porthos money is needed and I have	79.69164276123047
543/3605	I have replied DArtagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the	34.827518463134766
544/3605	There are in this bag three hundred pist	248.96633911132812
545/3605	Let each take seventyfive that is enough to take us to London and	544.7177124023438
546/3605	Besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at	666.3422241210938
547/3605	Why so   Because in all probability some one of us will be left on the	37.8430061340332
548/3605	Is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering   One of a most dangerous kind I give you	188.11204528808594
549/3605	Ah But if we do risk being killed said Porthos at least I should like to know what	54.18501663208008
550/3605	You would be all the wiser said Ath	256.7392272949219
551/3605	And yet said Aramis I am somewhat of Porthoss	87.87483215332031
552/3605	Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	455.10198974609375
553/3605	He says to you jauntily Gentlemen there is fighting going on in Gascony or in Flanders go and fight and you go	400.5671081542969
554/3605	Why You need give yourselves no more uneasiness about	208.49197387695312
555/3605	DArtagnan is right said Athos here are our three leaves of absence which came from Monsieur de Tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from I dont know	41.063720703125
556/3605	So let us go and get killed where we are told to	124.75736236572266
557/3605	Is life worth the trouble of so many questions DArtagnan I am ready to follow	44.39301681518555
558/3605	And indeed I am not sorry to quit Paris I had need of	151.9783935546875
559/3605	Well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said DArtagn	206.396728515625
560/3605	And now when are we to go asked Ath	84.38213348388672
561/3605	Immediately replied DArtagnan we have not a minute to	80.93433380126953
562/3605	Hello Grimaud Planchet Mousqueton Bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hô	136.4653778076172
563/3605	Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lac	246.36192321777344
564/3605	Planchet Grimaud Mousqueton and Bazin set off at full	42.973663330078125
565/3605	Now let us lay down the plan of campaign said Porth	111.61090850830078
566/3605	Where do we go first   To Calais said DArtagnan that is the most direct line to	80.34858703613281
567/3605	Well said Porthos this is my advice   Speak   Four men traveling together would be	113.66564178466797
568/3605	DArtagnan will give each of us his	56.00597381591797
569/3605	Gentlemen said Athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an	89.67559051513672
570/3605	A secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lac	424.2528991699219
571/3605	Porthoss plan appears to me to be impracticable said DArtagnan inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give	47.93896484375
572/3605	I am the bearer of a letter that is	27.130659103393555
573/3605	I have not and I cannot make three copies of that letter because it is	271.3525390625
574/3605	We must then as it appears to me travel in	184.84130859375
575/3605	This letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the	99.92283630371094
576/3605	If I should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be anothers turn and so onprovided a single one arrives that is all that is	184.69119262695312
577/3605	Bravo DArtagnan your opinion is mine cried Athos Besides we must be consistent I am going to take the waters you will accompany	126.24319458007812
578/3605	Instead of taking the waters of Forges I go and take sea waters I am free to do	483.244140625
579/3605	If anyone wishes to stop us I will show Monsieur de Trévilles letter and you will show your leaves of	220.6500244140625
580/3605	If we are attacked we will defend ourselves if we are tried we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the	237.0939178466797
581/3605	They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a	766.1119384765625
582/3605	We will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as DArtagnan says will carry the	265.67681884765625
583/3605	Well said cried Aramis you dont often speak Athos but when you do speak it is like	150.4180908203125
584/3605	And you Porthos   I agree to it too said Porthos if DArtagnan approves of	45.00279235839844
585/3605	DArtagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will	82.78026580810547
586/3605	Well said DArtagnan I decide that we should adopt Athoss plan and that we set off in half an	57.27348327636719
587/3605	Agreed shouted the three Musketeers in	316.9166564941406
588/3605	Each one stretching out his hand to the bag took his seventyfive pistoles and made his preparations to set out at the time	130.06649780273438
589/3605	THE JOURNEY     At two oclock in the morning our four adventurers left Paris by the Barrière	252.42918395996094
590/3605	As long as it was dark they remained silent in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every	367.1833801269531
591/3605	With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened with the sun gaiety	931.6915283203125
592/3605	It was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good	188.35455322265625
593/3605	Besides the appearance of the caravan was	1232.155517578125
594/3605	The black horses of the Musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incogn	218.457275390625
595/3605	The lackeys followed armed to the	470.35565185546875
596/3605	All went well till they arrived at Chantilly which they reached about eight oclock in the	53.60969924926758
597/3605	They needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an _auberge_ recommended by a sign representing	270.58233642578125
598/3605	Martin giving half his cloak to a poor	280.4005126953125
599/3605	They ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again	308.882568359375
600/3605	They entered the common hall and placed themselves at	254.8957061767578
601/3605	A gentleman who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfast	71.02588653564453
602/3605	He opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers	743.0108642578125
603/3605	He drank to their good health and the travelers returned his polit	220.56365966796875
604/3605	But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to Porthos to drink the health of the	58.832088470458984
605/3605	Porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the	81.04497528076172
606/3605	The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his Emin	297.8762512207031
607/3605	Porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his	91.12922668457031
608/3605	You have committed a piece of folly said Athos but it cant be helped there is no drawing	97.69957733154297
609/3605	Kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you	61.08041000366211
610/3605	All three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing	248.35145568847656
611/3605	There goes one cried Athos at the end of five hundred p	48.250511169433594
612/3605	But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us asked Aram	65.00537109375
613/3605	Because as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said DArtagn	56.722137451171875
614/3605	I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom murmured Athos and the travelers continued their	336.6835021972656
615/3605	At Beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for Porth	76.31244659423828
616/3605	At the end of two hours as Porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their	76.51856994628906
617/3605	At a league from Beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with	356.3633117675781
618/3605	Aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather	11006.6865234375
619/3605	Athos wished to restrain him but it was too	76.6625747680664
620/3605	The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos who urged on his horse against one of	537.7593383789062
621/3605	Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in	616.1344604492188
622/3605	Aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the lo	214.83343505859375
623/3605	Therefore Mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really	94.24290466308594
624/3605	Dont waste a charge Forward   Aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the	159.08633422851562
625/3605	Mousquetons horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his	82.7337417602539
626/3605	That will serve us for a relay said Ath	413.9376525878906
627/3605	I would rather have had a hat said DArtagn	29.163679122924805
628/3605	Mine was carried away by a	78.65432739257812
629/3605	By my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in	53.58927536010742
630/3605	Theyll kill poor Porthos when he comes up said Aram	101.35077667236328
631/3605	If Porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said Ath	45.64537811279297
632/3605	My opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not	263.1352233886719
633/3605	They continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse	186.58103942871094
634/3605	The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption but at Crèvecœur Aramis declared he could proceed no	1331.6236572265625
635/3605	In fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so	264.9115905761719
636/3605	He grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his	108.44091033935547
637/3605	They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left Bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Am	151.83982849121094
638/3605	_Morbleu_ said Athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and Grimaud and Planchet _Morbleu_ I wont be their dupe I will answer for	83.77901458740234
639/3605	I will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and	404.2645568847656
640/3605	I swear by   Dont waste time in swearing said DArtagnan let us gallop if our horses will	136.9343719482422
641/3605	And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their	8152.46728515625
642/3605	They arrived at Amiens at midnight and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden	442.3536682128906
643/3605	The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on	297.79345703125
644/3605	He received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the	225.88204956054688
645/3605	He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hô	160.97840881347656
646/3605	The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the	236.9046173095703
647/3605	The host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they	112.90629577636719
648/3605	They had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the	503.9427490234375
649/3605	Grimaud can take care of the horses said Planc	83.54536437988281
650/3605	If you are willing gentlemen I will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach	186.3763427734375
651/3605	And on what will you sleep said DArtagn	34.3077507019043
652/3605	Here is my bed replied Planchet producing a bundle of	336.06964111328125
653/3605	Come then said DArtagnan you are	9.842493057250977
654/3605	Mine hosts face does not please me at all it is too	462.63665771484375
655/3605	Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five oclock in the morning he and the four horses should be	76.87195587158203
656/3605	Toward two oclock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door but as Planchet awoke in an instant and cried Who goes there somebody replied that he was mistaken and went	114.51851654052734
657/3605	At four oclock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the st	46.13593292236328
658/3605	Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten	2085.23583984375
659/3605	When they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitch	819.5250244140625
660/3605	Planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used	83.90135192871094
661/3605	All these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a	313.1455078125
662/3605	Athos and DArtagnan went out while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were not three horses for sale in the	45.648685455322266
663/3605	At the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully	3197.832763671875
664/3605	He asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the	203.30247497558594
665/3605	Athos went down to pay the reckoning while DArtagnan and Planchet stood at the street	46.53434371948242
666/3605	The host was in a lower and back room to which Athos was requested to	195.91156005859375
667/3605	Athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the	285.2769470214844
668/3605	The host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly	164.52987670898438
669/3605	He took the money which Athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as for	168.7769012451172
670/3605	You blackguard cried Athos going toward him Ill cut your ears off   At the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon Ath	241.7760467529297
671/3605	I am taken shouted Athos with all the power of his	118.67913055419922
672/3605	Go on DArtagnan Spur spur and he fired two	547.2557983398438
673/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gall	61.09541320800781
674/3605	Do you know what has become of Athos asked DArtagnan of Planchet as they galloped	24.61154556274414
675/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet I saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the	60.894466400146484
676/3605	Brave Athos murmured DArtagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces	90.71297454833984
677/3605	Forward Planchet forward You are a brave	113.97825622558594
678/3605	As I told you monsieur replied Planchet Picards are found out by being	166.60240173339844
679/3605	Besides I am here in my own country and that excites	85.6924057006836
680/3605	And both with free use of the spur arrived at	1071.5076904296875
681/3605	Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed	162.52980041503906
682/3605	At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais DArtagnans horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his	67.81995391845703
683/3605	There still remained Planchets horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a	93.15209197998047
684/3605	Fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the qu	58.64728546142578
685/3605	Planchet called his masters attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty p	76.3990249633789
686/3605	They made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great	127.86701965332031
687/3605	His boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to	174.47305297851562
688/3605	Nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the	127.44462585449219
689/3605	I have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket here it	81.97036743164062

692/3605	And that is situated   At a quarter of a league from the	32.97275924682617
693/3605	Look you may see it from hereat the foot of that little hill that slated	1737.098388671875
694/3605	And with his lackey he took the road to the governors country	130.41937255859375
695/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred p	16.768508911132812
696/3605	Once outside the city DArtagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little	94.51995086669922
697/3605	Monsieur you appear to be in great haste   No one can be more so monsie	30.834211349487305
698/3605	I am sorry for that said DArtagnan for as I am in great haste likewise I wish to beg you to render me a	39.141441345214844
699/3605	What   To let me sail	137.2141876220703
700/3605	Thats impossible said the gentleman I have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours and by tomorrow at midday I must be in	250.32650756835938
701/3605	I have performed that same distance in forty hours and by ten oclock in the morning I must be in	89.75062561035156
702/3605	Very sorry monsieur but I was here first and will not sail	121.91072082519531
703/3605	I am sorry too monsieur but I arrived second and must sail	165.30918884277344
704/3605	But this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to	104.1489486694336
705/3605	_Parbleu_ What do you desire it to be   What do you want   Would you like to know  	23.77474021911621
706/3605	Well then I wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that I have not one of my own and must have	96.99785614013672

708/3605	My brave young man I will blow out your	74.35282897949219
709/3605	_Hola_ Lubin my pistols   Planchet called out DArtagnan take care of the lackey I will manage the	298.3755187988281
710/3605	Planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon Lubin and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his	548.7560424804688
711/3605	Go on with your affair monsieur cried Planchet I have finished	68.64253234863281
712/3605	Seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon DArtagnan but he had too strong an	80.33004760742188
713/3605	In three seconds DArtagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust One for Athos one for Porthos and one for Aramis   At the third hit the gentleman fell like a	151.19630432128906
714/3605	This time the gentleman closed his eyes and f	95.7219009399414
715/3605	DArtagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the	56.24129104614258
716/3605	It was in the name of Comte de Ward	653.8916015625
717/3605	But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his	682.5866088867188
718/3605	Planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he	94.19155883789062
719/3605	Monsieur said he as long as I hold him in this manner he cant cry Ill be bound but as soon as I let go he will howl	157.40386962890625
720/3605	I know him for a Norman and Normans are obst	771.2772216796875
721/3605	In fact tightly held as he was Lubin endeavored still to cry	3139.56005859375
722/3605	Stay said DArtagnan and taking out his handkerchief he gagged	30.608829498291016
723/3605	Now said Planchet let us bind him to a	59.708885192871094
724/3605	This being properly done they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his servant and as night was approaching and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next	216.0453338623047
725/3605	And now said DArtagnan to the	128.43629455566406
726/3605	But you are wounded it seems said Planc	81.43778991699219
727/3605	Oh thats nothing Let us attend to what is more pressing first and then we will attend to my wound besides it does not seem very	181.62869262695312
728/3605	And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy function	134.72683715820312
729/3605	The Comte de Wardes was announced and DArtagnan was	227.302001953125
730/3605	You have an order signed by the cardinal said the	90.81707000732422
731/3605	Yes monsieur replied DArtagnan here it	5.752994537353516
732/3605	Ah ah It is quite regular and explicit said the	1364.1795654296875
733/3605	Most likely said DArtagnan I am one of his most faithful	19.033876419067383
734/3605	It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to England   Yes a certain DArtagnan a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to	156.64173889160156
735/3605	Do you know him personally asked the	118.17355346679688
736/3605	And DArtagnan gave feature for feature a description of the Comte de Ward	467.87225341796875
737/3605	Is he accompanied   Yes by a lackey named Lub	609.910888671875
738/3605	We will keep a sharp lookout for them and if we lay hands on them his Eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good	103.9000473022461
739/3605	And by doing so Monsieur the Governor said DArtagnan you will deserve well of the	123.02152252197266
740/3605	Shall you see him on your return Monsieur Count   Without a	75.16569519042969
741/3605	Tell him I beg you that I am his humble	156.5997772216797
742/3605	Delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to DArtagn	148.19882202148438
743/3605	DArtagnan lost no time in useless	89.66947937011719
744/3605	He thanked the governor bowed and	418.3377685546875
745/3605	Once outside he and Planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another	108.96588134765625
746/3605	The vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wh	86.08988189697266
747/3605	Here is my pass countersigned said the	1318.108154296875
748/3605	And that other gentleman   He will not go today said DArtagnan but here Ill pay you for us	67.38825225830078
749/3605	In that case let us go said the ship	197.8397674560547
750/3605	He leaped with Planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on	41.5931510925293
751/3605	It was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when DArtagnan saw a flash and heard a deton	200.09463500976562
752/3605	It was the cannon which announced the closing of the	162.96343994140625
753/3605	He had now leisure to look to his	493.56024169921875
754/3605	Fortunately as DArtagnan had thought it was not	35.868629455566406
755/3605	The point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the	516.4907836914062
756/3605	Still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of	163.89312744140625
757/3605	A mattress was laid upon the deck for	536.193359375
758/3605	He threw himself upon it and fell	76.0549545288086
759/3605	On the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of	113.90040588378906
760/3605	The breeze had been so light all night they had made but little	296.31439208984375
761/3605	At ten oclock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of Dover and at half past ten DArtagnan placed his foot on English land crying Here I am at last   But that was not all they must get to	121.7096939086914
762/3605	In England the post was well	952.2567749023438
763/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before	208.83851623535156
764/3605	In a few hours they were in the	42.96637725830078
765/3605	DArtagnan did not know London he did not know a word of English but he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the dukes hô	49.10897445678711
766/3605	The duke was at Windsor hunting with the	1453.4915771484375
767/3605	DArtagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke French perfectly well he told him that he came from Paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master	87.56079864501953
768/3605	The confidence with which DArtagnan spoke convinced Patrick which was the name of this minister of the	178.23036193847656
769/3605	He ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young Guards	736.7040405273438
770/3605	As for Planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush the poor lads strength was almost	123.89342498779297
771/3605	On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues	373.9584655761719
772/3605	In twenty minutes they were on the spot	95.87214660644531
773/3605	Patrick soon caught the sound of his masters voice calling his fal	363.1679992675781
774/3605	Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke asked	5653.17041015625
775/3605	The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont Neuf opposite the Samarit	419.681640625

777/3605	Patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited	137.8791046142578
778/3605	No misfortune has happened to the queen cried Buckingham the instant he came up throwing all his fear and love into the	224.93116760253906
779/3605	I believe not nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from which your Grace alone can extricate	553.8284912109375
780/3605	What is it I should be too happy to be of any service to	45.27348327636719
781/3605	Speak speak   Take this letter said DArtagn	34.991676330566406
782/3605	This letter From whom comes this letter   From her Majesty as I	428.639404296875
783/3605	From her Majesty said Buckingham becoming so pale that DArtagnan feared he would faint as he broke the	321.00347900390625
784/3605	What is this rent said he showing DArtagnan a place where it had been pierced	156.71817016601562
785/3605	Ah said DArtagnan I did not see that it was the sword of the Comte de Wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the	74.76722717285156
786/3605	You are wounded asked Buckingham as he opened the	329.5842590332031
787/3605	Oh nothing but a scratch said DArtagn	34.428802490234375

790/3605	Come monsieur come and both set off towards the capital at full gall	50.06879806518555
791/3605	THE COUNTESS DE WINTER     As they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from DArtagnan not all that had happened but what DArtagnan himself	299.72064208984375
792/3605	By adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queens letter short but explicit gave him the	330.99871826171875
793/3605	But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in England had not succeeded in arresting him on the	190.579345703125
794/3605	The horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of	58.95438766479492
795/3605	DArtagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not	123.50655364990234
796/3605	He kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the	510.6190490722656
797/3605	In fact in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked	180.35614013671875
798/3605	DArtagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled	490.4610595703125
799/3605	On entering the court of his hôtel Buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestib	97.23023223876953
800/3605	DArtagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the st	139.91575622558594
801/3605	The duke walked so fast that DArtagnan had some trouble in keeping up with	64.48360443115234
802/3605	He passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of	150.66395568847656
803/3605	In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same	83.378173828125
804/3605	Encouraged by this invitation DArtagnan followed the duke who closed the door after	61.009647369384766
805/3605	The two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of	284.87188720703125
806/3605	Over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a fulllength portrait of Anne of Austria so perfect in its resemblance that DArtagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding	202.68270874023438
807/3605	One might believe the queen was about to	73.79405212402344
808/3605	On the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond stud	370.566650390625
809/3605	The duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the c	186.32337951660156
810/3605	There said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with	143.95997619628906
811/3605	The queen gave them to me the queen requires them	212.7548065185547
812/3605	Her will be done like that of God in all	95.70067596435547
813/3605	Then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to	157.68099975585938
814/3605	All at once he uttered a terrible	101.65084838867188
815/3605	What is the matter exclaimed DArtagnan anxiously what has happened to you my Lord   All is lost cried Buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only	112.9589614868164
816/3605	Can you have lost them my Lord or do you think they have been stolen   They have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this	87.4579849243164
817/3605	Hold see The ribbons which held them have been cut with	832.5863037109375
818/3605	If my Lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his	629.325927734375
819/3605	The only time I have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at	593.4267578125
820/3605	The Comtesse de Winter with whom I had quarreled became reconciled to me at that	136.53280639648438
821/3605	That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous	818.89892578125
822/3605	I have never seen her from that	66.02931213378906
823/3605	The woman is an agent of the	99.52701568603516
824/3605	He has agents then throughout the world cried DArtagn	99.09285736083984
825/3605	Oh yes said Buckingham grating his teeth with	721.5064697265625
826/3605	But when is this ball to take place   Monday	1294.8079833984375
827/3605	Monday next Still five days before	847.5708618164062
828/3605	Patrick cried the duke opening the door of the chapel Patrick His confidential valet	348.6683654785156
829/3605	The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without	186.65988159179688
830/3605	But although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his	245.2698211669922
831/3605	This was simply because he lived in the hô	113.09342956542969
832/3605	He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own	210.56198120117188
833/3605	Jackson said he go instantly to the Lord Chancellor and tell him that I charge him with the execution of these	221.3878631591797
834/3605	I wish them to be promulgated	1801.172119140625
835/3605	But my Lord if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall I reply   That such is my pleasure and that I answer for my will to no	346.24365234375
836/3605	Will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his Majesty if by chance his Majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great Britain   You are right	197.06565856933594
837/3605	He will say in that case to the king that I am determined on war and that this measure is my first act of hostility against	134.7373046875
838/3605	We are safe on that side said Buckingham turning toward DArtagn	120.37533569335938
839/3605	If the studs are not yet gone to Paris they will not arrive till after	132.925537109375
840/3605	How so   I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his Majestys ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an	1782.925048828125
841/3605	DArtagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrig	66.79837036132812
842/3605	Buckingham saw by the expression of the young mans face what was passing in his mind and he	113.27249908447266
843/3605	Yes said he yes Anne of Austria is my true	110.41095733642578
844/3605	Upon a word from her I would betray my country I would betray my king I would betray my	212.5011444091797
845/3605	She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle the assistance I promised them I have not done	205.99920654296875
846/3605	I broke my word it is true but what signifies that I obeyed my love and have I not been richly paid for that obedience It was to that obedience I owe her	159.88621520996094
847/3605	DArtagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are	493.1828918457031
848/3605	He was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith	465.8819885253906
849/3605	He was an Irishmanone of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of	99.33157348632812
850/3605	OReilly said the duke leading him into the chapel look at these diamond studs and tell me what they are worth	291.76458740234375
851/3605	The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set calculated one with another what the diamonds were worth and without hesitation said Fifteen hundred pistoles each my	689.9359130859375
852/3605	How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them You see there are two	379.35601806640625
853/3605	I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by the day after	63.38465881347656
854/3605	You are a jewel of a man	317.3196716308594
855/3605	These studs cannot be trusted to anybody it must be done in the	177.7190399169922
856/3605	Impossible my Lord There is no one but myself can so execute them that one cannot tell the new from the	286.7320861816406
857/3605	And if you wish ever to leave my palace you cannot so make the best of	194.11111450195312
858/3605	Name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must	293.39208984375
859/3605	He knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to	475.4389343261719
860/3605	May I be permitted to inform my wife said	229.6661834716797
861/3605	Oh you may even see her if you like my dear	171.53286743164062
862/3605	Your captivity shall be mild be assured and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance I cause	284.0729064941406
863/3605	DArtagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus openhanded sported with men and	406.43536376953125
864/3605	As to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary	452.1919250488281
865/3605	Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a	410.7052307128906
866/3605	Then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_	178.7277069091797
867/3605	We need not add that the goldsmith OReilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any	1082.174560546875
868/3605	This point settled the duke turned to DArtagn	43.09842300415039
869/3605	Now my young friend said he England is all our	167.71055603027344
870/3605	What do you wish for What do you desire   A bed my Lord replied DArtagn	40.52818298339844
871/3605	At present I confess that is the thing I stand most in need	98.8568344116211
872/3605	Buckingham gave DArtagnan a chamber adjoining his	1053.4613037109375
873/3605	He wished to have the young man at handnot that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the	107.53095245361328
874/3605	In one hour after the ordinance was published in London that no vessel bound for France should leave port not even the packet boat with	1161.1121826171875
875/3605	In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two	106.5810546875
876/3605	Here said he to him are the diamond studs that you came to bring and be my witness that I have done all that human power could	135.47068786621094
877/3605	Be satisfied my Lord I will tell all that I have	64.49119567871094
878/3605	But does your Grace mean to give me the studs without the casket   The casket would encumber	291.2922058105469
879/3605	Besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to	135.8251495361328
880/3605	You will say that I keep	49.18660354614258
881/3605	I will perform your commission word for word my	541.450927734375
882/3605	And now resumed Buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you   DArtagnan blushed up to the whites of his	128.6398468017578
883/3605	He saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with English gold was strangely repugnant to	91.7132339477539
884/3605	Let us understand each other my Lord replied DArtagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no	73.96868133544922
885/3605	I am in the service of the King and Queen of France and form part of the company of Monsieur Dessessart who as well as his brotherinlaw Monsieur de Tréville is particularly attached to their Majest	121.01542663574219
886/3605	What I have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your	186.10032653808594
887/3605	And still further it is very probable I should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is	76.41064453125
888/3605	Yes said the duke smiling and I even believe that I know that other person it is   My Lord I have not named her interrupted the young man warm	56.83812713623047
889/3605	That is true said the duke and it is to this person I am bound to discharge my debt of	71.83309936523438
890/3605	We say Proud as a Scotsman murmured the Duke of	920.8348388671875
891/3605	And we say Proud as a Gascon replied DArtagn	115.4433364868164
892/3605	The Gascons are the Scots of	631.6953125
893/3605	DArtagnan bowed to the duke and was	35.38456726074219
894/3605	Well are you going away in that manner Where and how   Thats true   Fore Gad these Frenchmen have no consideration   I had forgotten that England was an island and that you were the king of	142.93751525878906
895/3605	Go to the riverside ask for the brig _Sund_ and give this letter to the captain he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by	424.027587890625
896/3605	The name of that port  	143.85745239257812
897/3605	When you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a signa mere fishermans	409.9186706542969
898/3605	You cannot be mistaken there is but	34.6001091003418
899/3605	Afterward   You will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word Forward   Which means   In French _En avant	197.47276306152344
900/3605	He will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to	94.99546813964844
901/3605	You will find in the same way four relays on your	147.1024627685547
902/3605	If you will give at each of these relays your address in Paris the four horses will follow you th	135.86395263671875
903/3605	You already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a	171.73304748535156
904/3605	They were those we rode on and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to	146.1425323486328
905/3605	These horses are equipped for the	1938.036865234375
906/3605	However proud you may be you will not refuse to accept one of them and to request your three companions to accept the othersthat is in order to make war against	83.3376693725586
907/3605	Besides the end justified the means as you Frenchmen say does it not   Yes my Lord I accept them said DArtagnan and if it please God we will make a good use of your	101.57284545898438
908/3605	Perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends I	76.98185729980469
909/3605	Yes my Lord but with the hope of soon becoming	741.9586181640625
910/3605	I depend upon your word my	119.86018371582031
911/3605	DArtagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the rivers	41.8712158203125
912/3605	Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to	197.85609436035156
913/3605	Fifty vessels were waiting to set	662.8424072265625
914/3605	The next day about nine oclock in the morning he landed at	51.69513702392578
915/3605	DArtagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from	96.1396713256836
916/3605	War between England and France was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carous	532.30029296875
917/3605	I want to know the route I am to follow said DArtagn	34.275726318359375
918/3605	Go from hence to Blangy and from Blangy to Neufchâ	6716.20654296875
919/3605	At Neufchâtel go to the tavern of the Golden Harrow give the password to the landlord and you will find as you have here a horse ready sadd	497.2209167480469
920/3605	Have I anything to pay demanded DArtagn	138.05857849121094
921/3605	Everything is paid replied the host and liber	1593.6163330078125
922/3605	Begone and may God guide you   Amen cried the young man and set off at full gall	101.71514129638672
923/3605	Four hours later he was in Neufchâ	5104.8662109375
924/3605	He strictly followed the instructions he had	397.8082275390625
925/3605	Valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting	204.0887451171875
926/3605	He was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill but he found the holsters furnished with similar	108.05687713623047
927/3605	Your address at Paris   Hôtel of the Guards company of Dessess	1289.3466796875
928/3605	Which route must I take demanded DArtagnan in his	108.40327453613281
929/3605	That of Rouen but you will leave the city on your	171.81069946289062
930/3605	You must stop at the little village of Eccuis in which there is but one tavernthe Shield of	2913.67236328125
931/3605	Dont condemn it from appearances you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as	125.03028869628906
932/3605	Adieu master   A good journey gentlemen Do you want anything   DArtagnan shook his head and set off at full	47.247684478759766
933/3605	At Eccuis the same scene was	3427.572265625
934/3605	He found as provident a host and a fresh	373.76806640625
935/3605	He left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for Ponto	89.10774230957031
936/3605	At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine oclock galloped into the yard of Trévilles hô	145.11196899414062
937/3605	He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve	130.3505401611328
938/3605	Eight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hôtel de Ville for this important	60.86453628540039
939/3605	These keys were given up to him	364.1065979003906
940/3605	Each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized and from that moment the Sieur de la Coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the	215.70770263671875

946/3605	At nine oclock Madame la Première Présidente	12467.0966796875

951/3605	It was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre to the Hôtel de Ville and which were all illuminated with colored lantern	33.24763870239258

964/3605	At the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a Spanish caval	96.9312744140625

969/3605	The king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely	88.48004913330078
970/3605	Sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this I feared some accident might happen to	82.57140350341797
971/3605	If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself there	236.27330017089844
972/3605	I tell you that you were	19.86461639404297
973/3605	The voice of the king was tremulous with	136.9977264404297
974/3605	Everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what	227.39686584472656
975/3605	Sire said the queen I can send for them to the Louvre where they are and thus your Majestys wishes will be complied	159.82476806640625

978/3605	On his part the king returned to his	96.77896118164062
979/3605	There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the	103.58907318115234

982/3605	The king came out first from his	404.87860107421875
983/3605	He was in a most elegant hunting costume and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like	160.85740661621094
984/3605	This was the costume that best became the	348.2561340332031
985/3605	So dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his	479.98126220703125
986/3605	The cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small c	42.65138244628906
987/3605	The king opened it and found in it two diamond stud	537.159423828125
988/3605	What does this mean demanded he of the	159.52890014648438
989/3605	Nothing replied the latter only if the queen has the studs which I very much doubt count them sire and if you only find ten ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are	331.4053955078125
990/3605	The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him but he had not time to address any question to hima cry of admiration burst from every	91.77291107177734
991/3605	If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in	95.71318054199219
992/3605	It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admir	365.15625
993/3605	She wore a beaver hat with blue feathers a surtout of graypearl velvet fastened with diamond clasps and a petticoat of blue satin embroidered with	284.4601745605469
994/3605	On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the pettico	351.9107360839844
995/3605	The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the stud	126.44561004638672
996/3605	The only question was had she ten or twelve   At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the	192.7808074951172
997/3605	The king advanced toward Madame the President with whom he was to dance and his Highness Monsieur with the	326.361083984375
998/3605	They took their places and the ballet	222.6365203857422
999/3605	The king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the	162.22264099121094
1000/3605	A cold sweat covered the brow of the	156.99183654785156
1001/3605	The ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen _entrées	1551.7452392578125
1002/3605	The ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the	166.76023864746094
1003/3605	I thank you madame said he for the deference you have shown to my wishes but I think you want two of the studs and I bring them back to	57.72665023803711
1004/3605	With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given	91.49418640136719
1005/3605	How sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more I shall have	333.9190979003906
1006/3605	In fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her Majestys	739.1350708007812
1007/3605	What does this mean Monsieur Cardinal asked the king in a severe	123.51927185058594
1008/3605	This means sire replied the cardinal that I was desirous of presenting her Majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself I adopted this means of inducing her to accept	174.14898681640625
1009/3605	And I am the more grateful to your Eminence replied Anne of Austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his	165.75912475585938
1010/3605	Then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her	69.95661163330078
1011/3605	The queen had just regained her chamber and DArtagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly	74.94248962402344
1012/3605	He turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow	32.62065887451172
1013/3605	The face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent M	257.6193542480469
1014/3605	On the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the Swiss guard Germain whither DArtagnan had sent for	50.32536697387695
1015/3605	The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few	213.20458984375
1016/3605	Bonacieux moved by a double sentimentlove and	342.2231750488281
1017/3605	At length after winding about for a minute or two M	2117.328125
1018/3605	Bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led DArtagnan into	41.630821228027344
1019/3605	There she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapest	77.49220275878906
1020/3605	The opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she	762.4501342773438
1021/3605	The young man waited in comparative darkness and	4361.62939453125
1022/3605	The queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of	139.91294860839844
1023/3605	Although DArtagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal	424.1828918457031
1024/3605	He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the	256.2772521972656
1025/3605	At length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapest	202.71421813964844
1026/3605	DArtagnan at once comprehended that this was his recomp	53.44477462768555
1027/3605	He cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his	49.52571487426758
1028/3605	Then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a	202.41854858398438
1029/3605	The door immediately closed and DArtagnan found himself again in complete	104.73291015625

1037/3605	Silence said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came   But where and when shall I see you again cried DArtagn	68.66168212890625
1038/3605	A note which you will find at home will tell	107.92526245117188

1045/3605	The reader may ask How came Planchet here when he was left stiff as a rush in	463.9917907714844
1046/3605	In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent him to Paris as he did the	330.2837219238281
1047/3605	Has anyone brought a letter for me asked DArtagnan	73.72954559326172

1049/3605	What do you mean blockhead   I mean to say that when I came in although I had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me I found a letter on the green table cover in your	100.59059143066406

1058/3605	While reading this letter DArtagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of	150.63357543945312
1059/3605	It was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted	66.27513122558594

1065/3605	At seven oclock in the morning he arose and called Planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding	56.61111068725586
1066/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan I am going out for all day	20.24079704284668

1080/3605	It appears that our journey was a remounting journey then   Exactly so said DArtagnan and nodding to Planchet he went	50.31864929199219
1081/3605	DArtagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with	211.67982482910156

1084/3605	The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor	689.224365234375

1095/3605	A slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux but so slight that DArtagnan did not perceive	79.98654174804688
1096/3605	Ah may you be a true prophet said DArtagnan	22.988571166992188

1187/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet on perceiving DArtagnan how glad I am to see	15.693595886230469
1188/3605	Why so Planchet asked the young	26.961219787597656
1189/3605	Do you place confidence in our landlordMonsieur Bonacieux   I Not the least in the	180.16429138183594
1190/3605	And you found it   Traitorous monsie	297.08770751953125
1191/3605	Indeed   Still more as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite	61.863651275634766
1192/3605	It seems you are right Planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to	186.0767364501953
1193/3605	What would you have Planchet What must come is	210.69094848632812

1195/3605	At nine oclock then be ready here at the hôtel I will come and take	108.9483642578125
1196/3605	Planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third	157.01895141601562
1197/3605	As to DArtagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the Gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of	139.6918487548828
1198/3605	THE PAVILION     At nine oclock DArtagnan was at the Hôtel des Gardes he found Planchet all	169.3948974609375
1199/3605	Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a	111.98898315429688
1200/3605	DArtagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed	102.18474578857422
1201/3605	It was quite dark and no one saw them go	143.2865753173828
1202/3605	Planchet took place behind his master and kept at a distance of ten paces from	52.820587158203125
1203/3605	DArtagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of La Conférence and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to	319.8892517089844
1204/3605	In fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneas	461.3760681152344
1205/3605	But why did you not dare to speak aloud Planchetbecause you are afraid   Afraid of being heard Yes monsie	63.49129104614258
1206/3605	Afraid of being heard Why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear Planchet and no one could find fault with	162.3238525390625
1207/3605	Ah monsieur replied Planchet recurring to his besetting idea that Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his	409.44476318359375
1208/3605	What the devil makes you think of Bonacieux   Monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we	44.16498947143555
1209/3605	Monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a	134.14956665039062
1210/3605	And you are very virtuous are you not Planchet   Monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder Had we not better lower our heads   In truth murmured DArtagnan to whom	102.37080383300781

1212/3605	And he put his horse into a tro	47.92015075683594
1213/3605	Planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his	71.45042419433594
1214/3605	Are we going to continue this pace all night asked Planc	80.04476165771484
1215/3605	No you are at your journeys	371.07183837890625
1216/3605	How monsieur And you   I am going a few steps	42.64672088623047
1217/3605	Well if you are cold Planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six oclock in the	63.56793212890625
1218/3605	Monsieur I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that I have not a sou left in case I should be	97.99029541015625
1219/3605	DArtagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to Planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around	40.024269104003906
1220/3605	Good Lord how cold I am cried Planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the	100.12959289550781
1221/3605	In the meantime DArtagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached	253.01414489746094
1222/3605	Cloud but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion	149.14430236816406
1223/3605	It was situated in a very private	281.5763854980469
1224/3605	A high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers	219.32998657226562
1225/3605	He gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he	206.2628173828125
1226/3605	Not the least noise was to be heard it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the	55.39826965332031
1227/3605	DArtagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind	59.75417709350586
1228/3605	The appointed hour was about to	166.16761779785156
1229/3605	In fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of	62.51350784301758
1230/3605	Cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous	988.4181518554688
1231/3605	There was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young	218.10745239257812
1232/3605	His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first	62.38938522338867
1233/3605	Through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the	234.141357421875
1234/3605	There could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty M	622.4732055664062
1235/3605	This time without knowing why DArtagnan felt a cold shiver run through his	72.54560852050781
1236/3605	Perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral	333.53973388671875
1237/3605	Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o	250.00192260742188
1238/3605	He drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o	42.14128112792969
1239/3605	He went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this	219.133544921875
1240/3605	DArtagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to M	161.27320861816406
1241/3605	He clapped his hands three timesthe ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an	706.78173828125
1242/3605	He then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for	103.8919677734375
1243/3605	He approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and DArtagnan could get no	104.62250518798828
1244/3605	At that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pav	137.79168701171875
1245/3605	Besides DArtagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy	104.32923126220703
1246/3605	In an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pav	127.33000946044922
1247/3605	It was a strange thing and one which made DArtagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful	293.228759765625
1248/3605	One of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its	170.3470458984375
1249/3605	A table which had been covered with an elegant supper was	395.45977783203125
1250/3605	The decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the	504.18572998046875
1251/3605	Everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate	380.8324279785156
1252/3605	DArtagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the	493.73394775390625
1253/3605	He hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of	67.75731658935547
1254/3605	The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the	113.94375610351562
1255/3605	DArtagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarkedfor nothing had led him to the examinationthat the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and	264.6926574707031
1256/3605	Besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from Paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward	117.25733184814453
1257/3605	At length DArtagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a womans torn	131.9402313232422
1258/3605	This glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable	1663.009521484375
1259/3605	It was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty	294.4125061035156
1260/3605	As DArtagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and	461.40643310546875
1261/3605	And yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with M	277.1559753417969
1262/3605	Bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in Paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her	67.69624328613281
1263/3605	But all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over	654.592041015625
1264/3605	He ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boat	200.86265563964844
1265/3605	There were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to	201.5750732421875
1266/3605	Cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet DArtagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was M	84.71865844726562
1267/3605	DArtagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of M	84.71885681152344
1268/3605	Bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at	87.64033508300781
1269/3605	Cloud and not elsewhere before the DEstréess pavilion and not in another	1611.7718505859375
1270/3605	Everything conspired to prove to DArtagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had	43.889888763427734
1271/3605	He again ran back to the châte	46.19940185546875
1272/3605	It appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited	85.0738754272461
1273/3605	The lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the	278.19696044921875
1274/3605	DArtagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its	375.6334228515625
1275/3605	The gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chainedup dog went up to the	181.05003356933594
1276/3605	No one answered to his first	706.3746948242188
1277/3605	A silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked	166.32815551757812
1278/3605	It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise withina timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be	131.799560546875
1279/3605	Then DArtagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most	185.92178344726562
1280/3605	At length an old wormeaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of DArtagn	496.92132568359375
1281/3605	Nevertheless rapid as the movement had been DArtagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old	49.492225646972656
1282/3605	In the name of heaven cried he listen to me I have been waiting for someone who has not	43.46498489379883
1283/3605	Has anything particular happened in the neighborhood Speak   The window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than	151.06068420410156
1284/3605	DArtagnan related his story simply with the omission of	635.762451171875
1285/3605	He told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the	138.73507690429688
1286/3605	The old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when DArtagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing	68.63179779052734
1287/3605	In the name of heaven explain yourself   Oh Monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if I dared tell you what I have seen certainly no good would befall	72.3016586303711
1288/3605	You have then seen something replied DArtagn	36.43724060058594
1289/3605	In that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my	76.40940856933594
1290/3605	As I am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed I went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from	68.99615478515625
1291/3605	In the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddleh	146.9600830078125
1292/3605	These horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as caval	136.56283569335938
1293/3605	Ah my worthy gentlemen cried I what do you want You must have a ladder said he who appeared to be the leader of the	78.83216094970703
1294/3605	Yes monsieur the one with which I gather my	100.86979675292969
1295/3605	Lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused	109.39209747314453
1296/3605	Only remember thisif you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen I am quite sure however we may threaten you you are	120.4080581665039
1297/3605	At these words he threw me a crown which I picked up and he took the	77.59547424316406
1298/3605	After shutting the gate behind them I pretended to return to the house but I immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge I gained yonder clump of elder from which I could hear and see	152.52798461914062
1299/3605	The little old man remained at the coach door the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the saddleh	114.70629119873047
1300/3605	All at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the	50.50020980834961
1301/3605	Then I saw no more but I heard the noise of breaking	154.8004150390625
1302/3605	The woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon st	437.9574890136719
1303/3605	Two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after	98.15023040771484
1304/3605	The leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the	124.74730682373047
1305/3605	His two companions were already on horse	129.59512329101562
1306/3605	He sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was	73.59933471679688
1307/3605	From that moment I have neither seen nor heard	157.2235565185547
1308/3605	DArtagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his	190.1748504638672
1309/3605	But my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and thats a	273.3416748046875
1310/3605	Can you guess said DArtagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition   I dont know	51.76081085205078
1311/3605	But as you spoke to him you must have seen	36.08802032470703
1312/3605	Oh its a description you want   Exactly	269.5018310546875
1313/3605	A tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a	408.7729187011719
1314/3605	Thats the man cried DArtagnan again he forever he He is my demon	310.4942626953125
1315/3605	And the other   Which   The short	99.57415008544922
1316/3605	Oh he was not a gentleman Ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small	124.5239028930664
1317/3605	Poor woman poor woman what have they done with you   You have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old	45.10603332519531
1318/3605	A gentleman has but his word and I have given you	112.81856536865234
1319/3605	With a heavy heart DArtagnan again bent his way toward the	86.50924682617188
1320/3605	Sometimes he hoped it could not be M	792.6635131835938
1321/3605	Bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the Louvre sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her	180.1348114013672
1322/3605	His mind was torn by doubt grief and	1028.5452880859375
1323/3605	Oh if I had my three friends here cried he I should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them   It was past midnight the next thing was to find Planc	62.57389450073242
1324/3605	DArtagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find Planchet in any of	74.15363311767578
1325/3605	At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather	775.9014892578125
1326/3605	DArtagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was	37.88835525512695
1327/3605	Besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious	97.49988555908203
1328/3605	He was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or	190.17030334472656
1329/3605	DArtagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest	621.1671142578125
1330/3605	Toward six oclock DArtagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad	475.11212158203125
1331/3605	He was not long in making his	182.7274932861328
1332/3605	The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest Planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which DArtagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its	122.54167938232422
1333/3605	PORTHOS     Instead of returning directly home DArtagnan alighted at the door of	44.78206253051758
1334/3605	de Tréville and ran quickly up the	49.98399353027344
1335/3605	This time he had decided to relate all that had	108.61758422851562
1336/3605	de Tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole	85.63570404052734
1337/3605	de Tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her	191.80418395996094
1338/3605	de Tréville listened to the young mans account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love	164.96376037597656
1339/3605	When DArtagnan had finished he said Hum All this savors of his Eminence a league	236.4237518310547
1340/3605	But what is to be done said DArtagn	9.28466796875
1341/3605	Nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting Paris as I told you as soon as	149.10939025878906
1342/3605	I will see the queen I will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt	65.02046966552734
1343/3605	These details will guide her on her part and on your return I shall perhaps have some good news to tell	111.1135025024414
1344/3605	DArtagnan knew that although a Gascon	36.61244583129883
1345/3605	de Tréville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his	111.55924224853516
1346/3605	He bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant	148.25924682617188
1347/3605	Determined to put the advice of	77.5722427368164
1348/3605	de Tréville in practice instantly DArtagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his val	124.64896392822266
1349/3605	On approaching the house he perceived	179.62335205078125
1350/3605	Bonacieux in morning costume standing at his	580.2013549804688
1351/3605	All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of DArtagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done	39.91923904418945
1352/3605	In fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental DArtagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his count	540.1100463867188
1353/3605	A rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good	136.67813110351562
1354/3605	All falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true	323.04681396484375
1355/3605	It appeared then to DArtagnan that	39.198081970214844
1356/3605	Bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look	212.0547332763672
1357/3605	In consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before	34.9766731262207
1358/3605	Well young man said he we appear to pass rather gay nights Seven oclock in the morning _Peste_ You seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going	282.5102844238281
1359/3605	No one can reproach you for anything of the kind Monsieur Bonacieux said the young man you are a model for regular	75.99256896972656
1360/3605	It is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness	153.8448944091797
1361/3605	Happiness comes to meet him does it not Monsieur Bonacieux   Bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly	192.53689575195312
1362/3605	Ah ah said Bonacieux you are a jocular companion But where the devil were you gadding last night my young master It does not appear to be very clean in the cross	523.294189453125
1363/3605	DArtagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud	497.74822998046875
1364/3605	Both were stained with splashes of mud of the same	7404.833984375
1365/3605	Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of DArtagn	44.67741012573242
1366/3605	That little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was Bonacieux	1263.1009521484375
1367/3605	The husband had presided at the abduction of his	229.07843017578125
1368/3605	A terrible inclination seized DArtagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained	137.99874877929688
1369/3605	Ah but you are joking my worthy man said DArtagn	34.17414474487305
1370/3605	It appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a	1012.489501953125
1371/3605	May you not have been philandering a little also Monsieur Bonacieux Oh the devil Thats unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as	388.9396667480469
1372/3605	Oh Lord no said Bonacieux but yesterday I went to	383.5469055175781
1373/3605	Mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as I cannot possibly do without one and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud which I have not yet had time to	198.1530303955078
1374/3605	The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions DArtagnan had	106.97728729248047
1375/3605	Bonacieux had named Mandé because Mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from	3773.883544921875
1376/3605	This probability afforded him his first	3665.06787109375
1377/3605	If Bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret	465.9106750488281
1378/3605	The question then was how to change this probability into a	686.8487548828125
1379/3605	Pardon my dear Monsieur Bonacieux if I dont stand upon ceremony said DArtagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of	104.31937408447266
1380/3605	Allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment you know that is never refused among	186.59732055664062
1381/3605	Without waiting for the permission of his host DArtagnan went quickly into the house and cast a rapid glance at the	32.781158447265625
1382/3605	He had only been back an hour or two he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first	235.51089477539062
1383/3605	Thanks Monsieur Bonacieux said DArtagnan emptying his glass that is all I wanted of	41.43290328979492
1384/3605	I will now go up into my	68.78469848632812
1385/3605	I will make Planchet brush my boots and when he has done I will if you like send him to you to brush your	163.02989196777344
1386/3605	He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsider	338.62799072265625
1387/3605	At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great	46.824249267578125
1388/3605	Ah monsieur cried Planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more	42.982147216796875
1389/3605	I thought you would never come	60.09663772583008
1390/3605	Whats the matter now Planchet demanded DArtagn	64.0883560180664
1391/3605	Oh I give you a hundred I give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit I received in your	53.39958572387695
1392/3605	When   About half an hour ago while you were at Monsieur de Trév	71.20051574707031
1393/3605	Monsieur de Cavois   In	650.7490844726562
1394/3605	The captain of the cardinals Guards  	477.7674560546875
1395/3605	Did he come to arrest me   I have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling	64.24445343017578
1396/3605	Was he so sweet then   Indeed he was all honey monsie	189.3524169921875
1397/3605	Indeed   He came he said on the part of his Eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the Palais	114.48265075683594
1398/3605	It was called the PalaisCardinal before Richelieu gave it to the	960.6063842773438
1399/3605	What did you answer him   That the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could	55.65058135986328
1400/3605	The snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal replied the young man	313.4660949707031
1401/3605	Oh I saw the snare and I answered you would be quite in despair on your	92.42814636230469
1402/3605	Where has he gone asked Monsieur de Cav	546.2479248046875
1403/3605	And when did he set out   Yesterday	114.53331756591797
1404/3605	Planchet my friend interrupted DArtagnan you are really a precious	25.65407371520996
1405/3605	You will understand monsieur I thought there would be still time if you wish to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet	89.83399200439453
1406/3605	The falsehood would then lie at my door and as I am not a gentleman I may be allowed to	97.78585052490234
1407/3605	Be of good heart Planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious	231.69442749023438
1408/3605	In a quarter of an hour we set	17.2990779876709
1409/3605	Thats the advice I was about to give Monsieur and where are we going may I ask without being too curious   _Pardieu_ In the opposite direction to that which you said I was	60.051292419433594
1410/3605	Indeed I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of	469.4367370605469
1411/3605	So then   So then pack up our luggage Planchet and let us be	160.50978088378906
1412/3605	On my part I will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be	72.65728759765625
1413/3605	You may join me at the Hôtel des Gard	85.02549743652344
1414/3605	By the way Planchet I think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low w	106.84611511230469
1415/3605	Ah monsieur you may take my word when I tell you	20.78255844116211
1416/3605	I am a physiognomist I assure	38.724830627441406
1417/3605	DArtagnan went out first as had been agreed	38.642112731933594
1418/3605	Then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three	65.54096984863281
1419/3605	No news had been received of them only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for Aram	351.2731628417969
1420/3605	Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the Hôtel des Gard	44.499271392822266
1421/3605	DArtagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse	58.78158950805664
1422/3605	Thats well said he to Planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the	77.26289367675781
1423/3605	Do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece said Planchet with his shrewd	124.57843017578125
1424/3605	No Monsieur Jester replied DArtagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them	77.60779571533203
1425/3605	Which is a great chance replied Planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of	66.71548461914062
1426/3605	Amen said DArtagnan getting into his	54.817195892333984
1427/3605	As they went from the Hôtel des Gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit Paris by the Barrière de la Villette and the other by the Barrière Montmartre to meet again beyond	120.20452117919922
1428/3605	Denisa strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate	1963.420166015625
1429/3605	Planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by	153.97325134277344
1430/3605	His natural prudence however never forsook him for a single	233.6369171142578
1431/3605	He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an	185.2800750732422
1432/3605	It followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from DArtagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no	131.69622802734375
1433/3605	Nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of Great	176.343505859375
1434/3605	Martin the same at which they had stopped on their first	160.78370666503906
1435/3605	The host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the	215.75933837890625
1436/3605	Now as they had already traveled eleven leagues DArtagnan thought it time to stop whether Porthos were or were not in the	139.8910675048828
1437/3605	Perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the Musket	47.60261154174805
1438/3605	DArtagnan was therefore served with miraculous cel	172.26805114746094
1439/3605	The regiment of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and DArtagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a	206.46827697753906
1440/3605	The host desired himself to serve him which DArtagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following	187.5328369140625
1441/3605	Take your glass then and let us	194.56027221679688
1442/3605	But what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility Let us drink to the prosperity of your	411.7444763183594
1443/3605	Your Lordship does me much honor said the host and I thank you sincerely for your kind	372.0431213378906
1444/3605	But dont mistake said DArtagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may thinkfor it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well	239.0819091796875
1445/3605	In hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his	1021.36083984375
1446/3605	Now I travel a great deal particularly on this road and I wish to see all innkeepers making a	227.09983825683594
1447/3605	It seems to me said the host that this is not the first time I have had the honor of seeing Monsie	15.183528900146484
1448/3605	Bah I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly and out of the ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at	79.93106079101562
1449/3605	Why I was here only ten or twelve days	55.229095458984375
1450/3605	I was conducting some friends Musketeers one of whom by the by had a dispute with a strangera man who sought a quarrel with him for I dont know	238.9518585205078
1451/3605	Exactly so said the host I remember it	107.85565185546875
1452/3605	It is not Monsieur Porthos that your Lordship means   Yes that is my companions	129.95606994628906
1453/3605	My God my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him   Your Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his	105.49633026123047
1454/3605	Why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of	36.916770935058594
1455/3605	He has done us the honor to remain	48.42843246459961
1456/3605	What he had done you the honor to remain here   Yes monsieur in this house and we are even a little uneasy   On what account   Of certain expenses he has	55.27981185913086
1457/3605	Well but whatever expenses he may have incurred I am sure he is in a condition to pay	147.98048400878906
1458/3605	Ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my	1009.6368408203125
1459/3605	We have made considerable advances and this very morning the surgeon declared that if Monsieur Porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was I who had sent for	84.54891967773438
1460/3605	Porthos is wounded then   I cannot tell you monsie	17.646169662475586
1461/3605	What You cannot tell me Surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other	47.985939025878906
1462/3605	Yes but in our situation we must not say all we knowparticularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our	349.59930419921875
1463/3605	Well can I see Porthos   Certainly monsie	17.448171615600586
1464/3605	Take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at Number	1259.020263671875
1465/3605	Only warn him that it is	59.877559661865234
1466/3605	Why should I do that   Because monsieur some mischief might happen to	64.77674102783203
1467/3605	Of what kind in the name of wonder   Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your	79.43457794189453
1468/3605	What have you done to him then   We have asked him for	39.04411697387695
1469/3605	The devil Ah I can understand	182.06544494628906
1470/3605	It is a demand that Porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but I know he must be so at	98.51280975341797
1471/3605	As our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the	183.79202270507812
1472/3605	It is true he had been playing the day	114.88134765625
1473/3605	Playing the day before And with whom   Lord who can say monsieur With some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet	160.59085083007812
1474/3605	When we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to	224.5750274658203
1475/3605	We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentlemans word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be	67.34366607666016
1476/3605	This reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his	141.30722045898438
1477/3605	Since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his	113.93685150146484
1478/3605	What Mousqueton is here then   Oh yes monsie	12.04376220703125
1479/3605	Five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition	153.6807403564453
1480/3605	It appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his	983.445556640625
1481/3605	Unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at	216.97296142578125
1482/3605	The fact is said DArtagnan I have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in Mousqu	47.5005989074707
1483/3605	That is possible monsieur but suppose I should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy I should be a ruined man   No for Porthos will pay	68.0578384399414
1484/3605	Hum said the host in a doubtful	87.28450775146484
1485/3605	The favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes	94.11711883544922
1486/3605	If I durst say what I believe on that head   What you believe   I ought rather to say what I	69.94326782226562
1487/3605	What you know   And even what I am sure	33.50771713256836
1488/3605	And of what are you so sure   I would say that I know this great	46.244384765625
1489/3605	And how do you know her   Oh monsieur if I could believe I might trust in your	47.53115463256836
1490/3605	Speak By the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your	109.24848937988281
1491/3605	Well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many	54.3044548034668
1492/3605	What have you done   Oh nothing which was not right in the character of a	66.19620513916016
1493/3605	Well   Monsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the	47.31534194946289
1494/3605	As he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this	80.00248718261719
1495/3605	And then   Instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe I took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess	74.958740234375
1496/3605	This was fulfilling the intentions of Monsieur Porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not   Nearly	45.70460891723633
1497/3605	Well monsieur do you know who this great lady is   No I have heard Porthos speak of her thats	38.76765060424805
1498/3605	Do you know who this pretended duchess is   I repeat to you I dont know	51.900352478027344
1499/3605	Why she is the old wife of a procurator of the Châtelet monsieur named Madame Coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous	421.15692138671875
1500/3605	It struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the Rue aux O	458.78009033203125
1501/3605	Has he been wounded then   Oh good Lord What have I said   You said that Porthos had received a sword	88.92216491699219
1502/3605	Yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say	85.95976257324219
1503/3605	Zounds monsieur Because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his	357.74957275390625
1504/3605	As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his	99.19454956054688
1505/3605	It is a wound that confines him to his bed   Ah and a master stroke too I assure	614.6285400390625
1506/3605	Your friends soul must stick tight to his	3890.0458984375
1507/3605	Were you there then   Monsieur I followed them from curiosity so that I saw the combat without the combatants seeing	147.59486389160156
1508/3605	And what took place   Oh The affair was not long I assure	73.84934997558594
1509/3605	They placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when Monsieur Porthos came to the _parade_ he had already three inches of steel in his	102.6673355102539
1510/3605	The stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and Monsieur Porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself	79.79952239990234
1511/3605	Upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was Porthos and not DArtagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and	69.22126007080078
1512/3605	So it was with Monsieur dArtagnan this stranger meant to quarrel   It appears	39.5041389465332
1513/3605	And do you know what has become of him   No I never saw him until that moment and have not seen him	25.82549285888672
1514/3605	Very well I know all that I wish to	34.6606559753418
1515/3605	Porthoss chamber is you say on the first story Number One   Yes monsieur the handsomest in the inna chamber that I could have let ten times	206.38648986816406
1516/3605	Bah Be satisfied said DArtagnan laughing Porthos will pay you with the money of the Duchess Coquen	126.46316528320312
1517/3605	And did you convey this answer to your guest   We took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his	159.83621215820312
1518/3605	So that he still expects his money   Oh Lord yes monsieur Yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the	112.02391052246094
1519/3605	Do you say the procurators wife is old and ugly   Fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to Pathauds	608.19482421875
1520/3605	In that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be	97.95768737792969
1521/3605	How not much Twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the	2176.484619140625
1522/3605	He denies himself nothing it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live	282.4942321777344
1523/3605	Never mind if his mistress abandons him he will find friends I will answer for	218.265380859375
1524/3605	So my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation	207.662109375
1525/3605	Monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurators wife and not to say a word of the wound   Thats agreed you have my	135.496337890625
1526/3605	Oh he would kill me   Dont be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he	54.37446975708008
1527/3605	Saying these words DArtagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interestedhis debt and his	127.39778900146484
1528/3605	At the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number	390.6701354980469
1529/3605	DArtagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the	129.49252319335938
1530/3605	In addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty	312.320068359375
1531/3605	At the sight of his friend Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy and Mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular	88.97866821289062
1532/3605	Ah _pardieu_ Is that you said Porthos to DArtagn	15.910192489624023
1533/3605	Excuse my not coming to meet you but added he looking at DArtagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me  	22.008331298828125
1534/3605	Has the host told you nothing then   I asked after you and came up as soon as I	115.08426666259766
1535/3605	And what has happened to you my dear Porthos continued DArtagn	11.667386054992676
1536/3605	Why on making a thrust at my adversary whom I had already hit three times and whom I meant to finish with the fourth I put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my	231.3964080810547
1537/3605	Truly   Honor Luckily for the rascal for I should have left him dead on the spot I assure	199.4886474609375
1538/3605	And what has became of him   Oh I dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the	57.33403396606445
1539/3605	But you my dear DArtagnan what has happened to you   So that this strain of the knee continued DArtagnan my dear Porthos keeps you in bed   My God thats	28.45315933227539
1540/3605	I shall be about again in a few	58.2569694519043
1541/3605	Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris You must be cruelly bored	124.09535217285156
1542/3605	That was my intention but my dear friend I have one thing to confess to	38.77135467529297
1543/3605	He accepted my challenge and my faith my seventyfive pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the	432.13519287109375
1544/3605	But you my dear DArtagnan   What can you expect my dear Porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said DArtagn	22.940542221069336
1545/3605	You know the proverb Unlucky at play lucky in	13801.185546875
1546/3605	You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its	263.8662414550781
1547/3605	I wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which I stood absolutely in need on account of my	141.62060546875
1548/3605	Well   Well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered	117.15555572509766
1549/3605	Truly   No so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the	358.0690612792969
1550/3605	But you are here my dear fellow let us speak of	23.867332458496094
1551/3605	I confess I began to be very uneasy on your	62.952659606933594
1552/3605	But your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear Porthos said DArtagnan directing the sick mans attention to the full stewpans and the empty	196.2354278564453
1553/3605	So you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position I am armed to the	281.5940856933594
1554/3605	And yet said DArtagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties	108.2498550415039
1555/3605	And he again pointed to the bottles and the stewp	355.3382873535156
1556/3605	This miserable strain confines me to my bed but Mousqueton forages and brings in	1714.85595703125
1557/3605	Friend Mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of	147.75140380859375
1558/3605	Mousqueton said DArtagnan you must render me a	21.62666893005371
1559/3605	What monsieur   You must give your recipe to Planc	28.4112606048584
1560/3605	I may be besieged in my turn and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your	38.748374938964844
1561/3605	Lord monsieur There is nothing more easy said Mousqueton with a modest	30.370853424072266
1562/3605	One only needs to be sharp thats	805.1031494140625
1563/3605	I was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a po	316.185791015625
1564/3605	And what did he do the rest of his time   Monsieur he carried on a trade which I have always thought	67.08718872070312
1565/3605	Now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a Catholic coming alone the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in his	1234.537353515625
1566/3605	He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the travelers abandoning his purse to save his	128.71868896484375
1567/3605	It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy	166.7448272705078
1568/3605	For my part monsieur I am Catholicmy father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a Huguen	788.7329711914062
1569/3605	And what was the end of this worthy man asked DArtagn	24.864341735839844
1570/3605	Oh of the most unfortunate kind monsie	75.39015197753906
1571/3605	One day he was surprised in a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a	526.7861328125
1572/3605	Then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and I were	268.88134765625
1573/3605	And what did you do said DArtagn	14.793373107910156
1574/3605	We let them tell their story out replied Mousqu	103.46126556396484
1575/3605	Then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the Catholic and I on that of the Huguen	498.067138671875
1576/3605	Two hours after all was over we had done the business of both admiring the foresight of our poor father who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different	118.01750946044922
1577/3605	Well I must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent	83.97976684570312
1578/3605	And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher   Yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a	133.80950927734375
1579/3605	The consequence is that when I saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours I had recourse to a little of my old	253.3065185546875
1580/3605	While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince I laid a few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his Highnesss pieces of water I slipped a few lines into his fish	312.5411682128906
1581/3605	So that now thanks be to God we do not want as Monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eelsall light wholesome food suitable for the	910.037353515625
1582/3605	But the wine said DArtagnan who furnishes the wine Your host   That is to say yes and	74.26689910888672
1583/3605	How yes and no   He furnishes it it is true but he does not know that he has that	64.14744567871094
1584/3605	Explain yourself Mousqueton your conversation is full of instructive	471.59710693359375
1585/3605	It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in my peregrinations who had seen many countries and among them the New	602.2504272460938
1586/3605	What connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   Patience monsieur everything will come in its	370.958251953125
1587/3605	This Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in his voyage to	144.78602600097656
1588/3605	This lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between	2713.176025390625
1589/3605	My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running no	259.3948669433594
1590/3605	I practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the	273.8639221191406
1591/3605	Well do you understand monsieur Our host has a wellfurnished cellar the key of which never leaves him only this cellar has a ventilating	759.00439453125
1592/3605	Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso and as I now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine thats my point for	413.93487548828125
1593/3605	You see monsieur what the New World has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the	531.249755859375
1594/3605	Now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it   Thank you my friend thank you unfortunately I have just breakfast	137.0134735107422
1595/3605	Well said Porthos arrange the table Mousqueton and while we breakfast DArtagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left	62.58738708496094
1596/3605	But there the confidence of DArtagnan	40.74589157104492
1597/3605	He only added that on his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent horsesone for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the	152.59083557128906
1598/3605	At this moment Planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at Clerm	122.08221435546875
1599/3605	For the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if Porthos were still at the Great	151.52056884765625
1600/3605	Martin he would call for him on his	79.38705444335938

1630/3605	DArtagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our oldfashioned tavern	147.3218994140625

1688/3605	DArtagnan thought it was proper to follow this	59.808048248291016

1749/3605	As for me I have almost forgotten the little Latin I have ever	96.154296875
1750/3605	Then I confess to you that I have eaten nothing since ten oclock this morning and I am devilish	107.84516143798828

1754/3605	What do you mean by tetragones asked DArtagnan uneas	127.3892822265625

1914/3605	Do you remember how he cried On DArtagnan on I am taken And when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword One might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were	221.4807891845703
1915/3605	These words redoubled the eagerness of DArtagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid	124.69830322265625
1916/3605	About eleven oclock in the morning they perceived Amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed	56.05018997192383
1917/3605	DArtagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped	292.9928283691406
1918/3605	He entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right	148.0970916748047
1919/3605	Do you remember me said he to the host who advanced to greet	68.44466400146484
1920/3605	I have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which DArtagnan	56.801361083984375
1921/3605	What you dont know me   No monseign	21.147592544555664
1922/3605	Well two words will refresh your	656.1826782226562
1923/3605	Ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice	86.45758056640625
1924/3605	Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his arm	335.6185302734375
1925/3605	Here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for I now recollect	146.24256896972656
1926/3605	It was you who rode off at the moment I had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak	130.72906494140625
1927/3605	Yes it was I so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole	65.10696411132812
1928/3605	Condescend to listen to me and you shall know	150.82215881347656
1929/3605	I had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as Guards or Musket	730.3197631835938
1930/3605	Monseigneur I was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenancesnothing was	264.8566589355469
1931/3605	Go on go on said DArtagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had	110.26091003417969
1932/3605	I took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as I thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coin	179.1398162841797
1933/3605	Again said DArtagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word _coiners	1644.5379638671875
1934/3605	Pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my	226.09747314453125
1935/3605	The authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the	111.08558654785156
1936/3605	But once again that gentlemanwhere is he What has become of him Is he dead Is he living   Patience monseigneur we are coming to	92.76331329345703
1937/3605	There happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape DArtagnan appeared to authorize the	153.9087371826172
1938/3605	That gentleman your friend defended himself	7557.9990234375
1939/3605	Alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon	49.30836486816406
1940/3605	As we were sure of finding him there we left him	142.64398193359375
1941/3605	Yes said DArtagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison	37.42632293701172
1942/3605	Good God To imprison him monseigneur Why he imprisoned himself I swear to you he	231.1611785888672
1943/3605	In the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely	163.3913116455078
1944/3605	The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and I have heard nothing of either of them	69.38880920410156
1945/3605	As for myself as soon as I recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor to whom I related all that had passed and asked what I should do with my	122.51433563232422
1946/3605	He told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders I had received did not come from him and that if I had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me	68.85328674316406
1947/3605	It appears that I had made a mistake monsieur that I had arrested the wrong person and that he whom I ought to have arrested had	72.08698272705078
1948/3605	Ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil To my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own	81.30392456054688
1949/3605	I told him very humblyfor I could not conceal from myself the scrape I had got into by laying hands on one of his Majestys MusketeersI told him I was quite ready to submit to his	208.5386962890625
1950/3605	In the first place said he I wish my lackey placed with me fully	139.3864288330078
1951/3605	We hastened to obey this order for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could	82.67218017578125
1952/3605	But where is Athos now cried DArtagn	24.864768981933594
1953/3605	Where is Athos   In the cellar monsie	16.13984489440918
1954/3605	What you scoundrel Have you kept him in the cellar all this time   Merciful heaven No monsieur We keep him in the cellar You do not know what he is about in the	77.55378723144531
1955/3605	We every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it but alas It is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest	294.9544677734375
1956/3605	I once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible	203.7589111328125
1957/3605	I heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musket	505.03631591796875
1958/3605	Then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the	147.82235717773438
1959/3605	Upon this I went and complained to the governor who replied that I only had what I deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my	179.735595703125
1960/3605	So that since that time replied DArtagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the	142.8024139404297
1961/3605	So from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the	81.1272201538086
1962/3605	There is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and saus	2061.7041015625
1963/3605	And as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to	214.46897888183594
1964/3605	If your friend remains another week in my cellar I shall be a ruined	139.85365295410156
1965/3605	And not more than justice either you ass Could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coinerssay   Yes monsieur you are right said the	274.9909973144531
1966/3605	But hark hark There he is   Somebody has disturbed him without doubt said DArtagn	123.65457916259766
1967/3605	But he must be disturbed cried the host Here are two English gentlemen just	210.64273071289062
1968/3605	Well   Well the English like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the	92.11897277832031
1969/3605	My wife has perhaps requested permission of Monsieur Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has	207.27647399902344
1970/3605	Ah good heaven There is the hullabaloo louder than ever   DArtagnan in fact heard a great noise on the side next the	323.97283935546875
1971/3605	He rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by Planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of	88.23602294921875
1972/3605	The two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and	238.83612060546875
1973/3605	One might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogresthe gigantic heroes of popular legends into whose cavern nobody could force their way with	782.7442626953125
1974/3605	There was a moment of silence but at length the two Englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a	231.82073974609375
1975/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan cocking his pistols I will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one	59.11509704589844
1976/3605	Ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have	230.1655731201172
1977/3605	Good God cried the hollow voice of Athos I can hear DArtagnan I	59.3752555847168
1978/3605	Yes cried DArtagnan raising his voice in turn I am here my	25.280683517456055
1979/3605	Ah good then replied Athos we will teach them these door breakers   The gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two	169.0543670654297
1980/3605	They still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to	2362.10791015625
1981/3605	Stand on one side DArtagnan stand on one side cried Ath	46.63563919067383
1982/3605	I am going to fire   Gentlemen exclaimed DArtagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are	64.12313842773438
1983/3605	Patience Athos You are running your heads into a very silly affair you will be	884.5082397460938
1984/3605	My lackey and I will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the	110.89019775390625
1985/3605	You will then have our swords with which I can assure you my friend and I can play tolerably	54.12571716308594
1986/3605	Let me conduct your business and my	171.38121032714844
1987/3605	You shall soon have something to drink I give you my	54.28190612792969
1988/3605	If there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of Ath	513.86767578125
1989/3605	The host felt a cold sweat creep down his	579.5739135742188
1990/3605	How If there is any left murmured	202.39076232910156
1991/3605	What the devil There must be plenty left replied DArtagn	131.0530548095703
1992/3605	Be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the	383.5992126464844
1993/3605	Gentlemen return your swords to their scabb	1100.9993896484375
1994/3605	Well provided you replace your pistols in your	246.69517517089844
1995/3605	Then turning toward Planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musket	173.39239501953125
1996/3605	The Englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumbling	676.101806640625
1997/3605	The history of Athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the	154.68649291992188
1998/3605	Now gentlemen said DArtagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes I will answer for it you shall have all you	41.10612869262695
1999/3605	Now I am alone my dear Athos said DArtagnan open the door I beg of	24.741994857788086
2000/3605	Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos which the besieged himself	784.0587768554688
2001/3605	An instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of Athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the	99.59537506103516
2002/3605	DArtagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tender	25.273801803588867
2003/3605	He then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that Athos	87.30377960205078
2004/3605	I am dead drunk thats all and never did a man more strongly set about getting	447.929443359375
2005/3605	By the Lord my good host I must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty	216.28756713867188
2006/3605	Mercy cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master I am a ruined	111.37793731689453
2007/3605	He would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the c	86.76471710205078
2008/3605	Hark I dont think he put the faucet in	747.7371826171875
2009/3605	Do you hear it It is running	337.5169677734375
2010/3605	DArtagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning	80.94568634033203
2011/3605	In the meantime Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head	81.11186218261719
2012/3605	Like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of Rub	4260.01953125
2013/3605	He was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive	701.7002563476562
2014/3605	The four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which DArtagnan occupied with	80.60957336425781
2015/3605	In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited	129.69216918945312
2016/3605	The image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of	505.60064697265625
2017/3605	Of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten	1934.1788330078125
2018/3605	Then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the	184.08584594726562
2019/3605	Athos did not even turn his	153.15460205078125
2020/3605	The host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two	158.1154327392578
2021/3605	Some wine said Athos on perceiving the	56.67166519165039
2022/3605	Some wine cried the stupefied host some wine Why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth I am a ruined man lost destroyed   Bah said Athos we were always	147.17831420898438
2023/3605	If you had been contented with drinking well and good but you have broken all the	164.4606170654297
2024/3605	You pushed me upon a heap which rolled	296.4735412597656
2025/3605	All my oil is lost   Oil is a sovereign balm for wounds and my poor Grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on	1028.7469482421875
2026/3605	All my sausages are gnawed   There is an enormous quantity of rats in that	366.7518615722656
2027/3605	You shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated	400.8607482910156
2028/3605	Triple ass said Athos rising but he sank down again	254.25741577148438
2029/3605	He had tried his strength to the	134.04348754882812
2030/3605	DArtagnan came to his relief with his whip in his	28.489891052246094
2031/3605	The host drew back and burst into	197.4601593017578
2032/3605	This will teach you said DArtagnan to treat the guests God sends you in a more courteous	107.12230682373047
2033/3605	God Say the devil   My dear friend said DArtagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you	56.520050048828125
2034/3605	Oh gentlemen said the host I have been	41.094886779785156
2035/3605	I confess it but pardon to every sin You are gentlemen and I am a poor inn	233.78402709960938
2036/3605	Ah if you speak in that way said Athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the c	68.46552276611328
2037/3605	We are not such devils as we appear to	157.08041381835938
2038/3605	Come hither I say and dont be afraid continued Ath	140.99114990234375
2039/3605	At the very moment when I was about to pay you I had placed my purse on the	43.69356918334961
2040/3605	That purse contained sixty pistoles where is it   Deposited with the justice they said it was bad	765.07666015625
2041/3605	Very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pist	538.8523559570312
2042/3605	But Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold	552.3623657226562
2043/3605	If it were bad money there might be some hopes but unfortunately those were all good	444.7567443847656
2044/3605	Manage the matter as well as you can my good man it does not concern me the more so as I have not a livre	116.00839233398438
2045/3605	Come said DArtagnan let us inquire	36.18550491333008
2046/3605	Athoss horse where is that   In the	95.70368957519531
2047/3605	How much is it worth   Fifty pistoles at	206.70114135742188
2048/3605	Take it and there ends the	1097.0625
2049/3605	What cried Athos are you selling my horsemy Bajazet And pray upon what shall I make my campaign upon Grimaud   I have brought you another said DArtagn	131.195556640625
2050/3605	Another   And a magnificent one cried the	72.8482666015625
2051/3605	Well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us	317.4510192871094
2052/3605	What asked the host quite cheerful	674.5258178710938

2054/3605	There are twentyfive bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my	381.8006286621094
2055/3605	Why this man is a cask said the host	128.0120391845703
2056/3605	If he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks I shall soon reestablish my	1753.9947509765625
2057/3605	And dont forget said DArtagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two English	71.81549835205078
2058/3605	As he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the	267.26422119140625
2059/3605	Thats well said Athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to Porthos and Aramis But you DArtagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally You have a sad	39.092552185058594
2060/3605	Alas said DArtagnan it is because I am the most	27.477397918701172
2061/3605	Presently And why presently Because you think I am drunk DArtagnan remember this My ideas are never so clear as when I have had plenty of	253.21328735351562
2062/3605	Athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said Trifles only trifles That was his favorite	676.0340576171875
2063/3605	You always say _trifles_ my dear Athos said DArtagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never	83.2840805053711
2064/3605	The drinkdeadened eye of Athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as	439.2617492675781
2065/3605	Thats true said he quietly for my part I have never	135.9262237548828
2066/3605	Acknowledge then you stony heart said DArtagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender	188.40460205078125
2067/3605	What do you say   I say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death You are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear DArtagn	137.15164184570312
2068/3605	Except you Athos who never had	117.52680206298828

2072/3605	Not a bad idea said Athos emptying and refilling his	649.1771850585938
2073/3605	Athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so DArtagnan saw that he became	52.83211135864258
2074/3605	He was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to	207.47047424316406
2075/3605	He kept himself upright and dreamed without	1525.825439453125
2076/3605	This somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in	963.451416015625
2077/3605	Through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the	225.26377868652344
2078/3605	She lived in a small town with her brother who was a cur	94.45120239257812
2079/3605	Both had recently come into the	137.20692443847656
2080/3605	They came nobody knew whence but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they	1442.0340576171875
2081/3605	They were said however to be of good	1926.7796630859375
2082/3605	My friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his willfor he was	380.0012512207031
2083/3605	Who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown persons Unfortunately he was an honorable man he married	200.58230590820312
2084/3605	The fool The ass The idiot   How so if he loved her asked DArtagn	177.7987060546875
2085/3605	He took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becoming	207.2818145751953
2086/3605	Well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued Athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and f	99.28469848632812
2087/3605	The count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her	298.9197998046875
2088/3605	DArtagnan said Athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her	181.82174682617188
2089/3605	Athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his	122.33808898925781
2090/3605	What do you tell me   Truth my	45.396759033203125
2091/3605	The angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a	477.228515625
2092/3605	And what did the count do   The count was of the highest	78.9682388305664
2093/3605	He had on his estates the rights of high and low tribun	886.8512573242188
2094/3605	He tore the dress of the countess to pieces he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a	198.9607391357422
2095/3605	No less said Athos as pale as a	100.69438934326172
2096/3605	But methinks I need wine and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary	164.04443359375
2097/3605	Then he let his head sink upon his two hands while DArtagnan stood before him stupef	37.376434326171875
2098/3605	That has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said Athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the	284.39697265625
2099/3605	God grant you as much Let us	342.31097412109375
2100/3605	Some ham my boy or we cant	1138.8546142578125
2101/3605	Oh I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night	252.6983642578125
2102/3605	Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was   He was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair	225.24337768554688
2103/3605	A worthy man who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married and securing her a	194.21192932128906
2104/3605	He has been hanged and quartered I	773.8954467773438
2105/3605	My God my God cried DArtagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible	102.36367797851562
2106/3605	Taste some of this ham DArtagnan it is exquisite said Athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young mans	124.86841583251953
2107/3605	What a pity it is there were only four like this in the	169.61717224121094
2108/3605	I could have drunk fifty bottles	1163.9876708984375
2109/3605	DArtagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewild	39.99736785888672
2110/3605	Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to	127.44778442382812
2111/3605	THE RETURN     DArtagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half	222.27734375
2112/3605	Besides which the Musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter	209.5320587158203
2113/3605	I was pretty drunk yesterday DArtagnan said he I can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very trem	182.6619873046875
2114/3605	I wager that I uttered a thousand extravag	403.0150451660156
2115/3605	While saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed	106.93846893310547
2116/3605	No replied DArtagnan if I recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common	44.45551681518555
2117/3605	I thought I had told you a most lamentable	220.59796142578125
2118/3605	And he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his	30.50831413269043
2119/3605	My faith said DArtagnan it appears that I was more drunk than you since I remember nothing of the	47.58284378051758
2120/3605	Athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you cannot have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or	278.83306884765625
2121/3605	My drunkenness is always sad and when I am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my	500.4112243652344
2122/3605	That is my failinga capital failing I admit but with that exception I am a good drink	1164.0081787109375
2123/3605	Athos spoke this in so natural a manner that DArtagnan was shaken in his	89.2918701171875
2124/3605	It is that then replied the young man anxious to find out the truth it is that then I remember as we remember a	103.35589599609375
2125/3605	Ah you see how it is said Athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh I was sure it was sothe hanging of people is my	257.1260070800781
2126/3605	I remember now yes it was aboutstop a minuteyes it was about a	319.4112548828125
2127/3605	Thats it replied Athos becoming almost livid that is my grand story of the fair lady and when I relate that I must be very	138.34510803222656
2128/3605	Yes that was it said DArtagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue	57.854759216308594
2129/3605	By her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued DArtagnan looking intently at Ath	36.65966033935547
2130/3605	Well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied Athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of	36.62929153442383
2131/3605	I certainly never will get drunk again DArtagnan it is too bad a	151.17921447753906
2132/3605	DArtagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once Athos said   By the by I thank you for the horse you have brought	57.996482849121094
2133/3605	Is it to your mind asked DArtagn	31.849475860595703
2134/3605	Yes but it is not a horse for hard	120.7146987915039
2135/3605	You are mistaken I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the Place	84.70993041992188
2136/3605	Ah you begin to awaken my	379.13232421875
2137/3605	Regret   Yes I have parted with	58.54697799682617
2138/3605	How   Why here is the simple	122.20318603515625
2139/3605	This morning I awoke at six o	114.3694839477539
2140/3605	You were still fast asleep and I did not know what to do with myself I was still stupid from our yesterdays debau	205.14346313476562
2141/3605	As I came into the public room I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from	436.1855773925781
2142/3605	I drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut n	104.46996307373047
2143/3605	_Pardieu_ said I my good gentleman I have a horse to sell	119.63886260986328
2144/3605	Ay and a very fine one I saw him yesterday your friends lackey was leading	344.7640380859375
2145/3605	Do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles Yes Will you sell him to me for that sum No but I will play for	88.88587951660156
2146/3605	No sooner said than done and I lost the	669.5010375976562
2147/3605	Ah ah But please to observe I won back the equipage cried Ath	488.90924072265625
2148/3605	Well I must confess it does replied DArtagn	25.828330993652344
2149/3605	That horse was to have identified us in the day of	565.3299560546875
2150/3605	But my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the Musket	87.55040740966797
2151/3605	I was hipped to death and still further upon my honor I dont like English	423.49090576171875
2152/3605	If it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable	119.5211181640625
2153/3605	As to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its	212.82806396484375
2154/3605	Why the devil A horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy   DArtagnan did not	497.78839111328125
2155/3605	It vexes me greatly continued Athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for I am not yet at the end of my	73.21817016601562
2156/3605	After having lost my own horse nine against tensee how nearI formed an idea of staking	3342.981201171875
2157/3605	Yes but you stopped at the idea I hope   No for I put it in execution that very	76.06627655029297
2158/3605	And the consequence said DArtagnan in great	84.47457122802734
2159/3605	What my horse   Your horse seven against eight a point shortyou know the	648.65234375
2160/3605	Athos you are not in your right senses I	113.96674346923828
2161/3605	My dear lad that was yesterday when I was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this	264.2025146484375
2162/3605	I lost him then with all his appointments and	414.761962890625
2163/3605	Stop a minute you dont know all	261.0400695800781
2164/3605	I should make an excellent gambler if I were not too hotheaded but I was hotheaded just as if I had been	144.22677612304688
2165/3605	Well I was not hotheaded then   Well but what else could you play for You had nothing left   Oh yes my friend there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger and which I had observed	163.4163360595703
2166/3605	This diamond said DArtagnan placing his hand eagerly on his	42.9874153137207
2167/3605	And as I am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once I estimated it at a thousand pist	72.69711303710938
2168/3605	Athos you make me tremble cried DArtagn	29.014423370361328
2169/3605	I mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked	397.4538269042969
2170/3605	What the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it Impossible   Go on go on my dear fellow said DArtagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your	69.90702819824219
2171/3605	We divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles	142.951416015625
2172/3605	You are laughing at me and want to try me said DArtagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as Minerva takes Achilles in the _Iliad	441.1142883300781
2173/3605	No I do not jest _mordieu_ I should like to have seen you in my place I had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of	104.6270523071289
2174/3605	That was no reason for staking my diamond replied DArtagnan closing his hand with a nervous sp	93.3526382446289
2175/3605	Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge in thirteen throws I had lost allin thirteen	688.6113891601562
2176/3605	The number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of July that   _Ventrebleu_ cried DArtagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding	102.50171661376953
2177/3605	Patience said Athos I had a	102.46051788330078
2178/3605	The Englishman was an original I had seen him conversing that morning with Grimaud and Grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his	71.78988647460938
2179/3605	I staked Grimaud the silent Grimaud divided into ten	1248.1788330078125
2180/3605	Well what next said DArtagnan laughing in spite of	25.740232467651367
2181/3605	Grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of Grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon I regained the	643.7474975585938
2182/3605	Tell me now if persistence is not a virtue   My faith But this is droll cried DArtagnan consoled and holding his sides with	254.86264038085938
2183/3605	You may guess finding the luck turned that I again staked the	910.2330932617188
2184/3605	The devil said DArtagnan becoming angry	73.24967956542969
2185/3605	I won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then I lost	534.915283203125
2186/3605	In brief I regained your harness and then	1911.427001953125
2187/3605	That was a superb throw so I left off	660.53466796875
2188/3605	DArtagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his	105.00269317626953
2189/3605	Then the diamond is safe said he timid	222.85882568359375
2190/3605	Intact my dear friend besides the harness of your Bucephalus and	2002.3638916015625
2191/3605	But what is the use of harnesses without horses   I have an idea about	86.09735870361328
2192/3605	You have not played for a long time DArtagn	24.082263946533203
2193/3605	And I have no inclination to	86.83570098876953
2194/3605	You have not played for a long time I said you ought then to have a good	78.39634704589844
2195/3605	Well what then   Well the Englishman and his companion are still	67.34700012207031
2196/3605	I remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very	712.2581176757812
2197/3605	You appear to think much of your	157.2764129638672
2198/3605	In your place I would stake the furniture against the	784.2584838867188
2199/3605	But he will not wish for only one	245.26048278808594
2200/3605	Stake both _pardieu_ I am not selfish as you	76.05281829833984
2201/3605	You would do so said DArtagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of Athos begin to prevail in spite of	252.5196075439453
2202/3605	On my honor in one single	795.2633056640625
2203/3605	But having lost the horses I am particularly anxious to preserve the harness	366.43231201171875
2204/3605	Never never   The devil said Ath	41.746036529541016
2205/3605	I would propose to you to stake Planchet but as that has already been done the Englishman would not perhaps be	118.08663940429688
2206/3605	Decidedly my dear Athos said DArtagnan I should like better not to risk	28.167238235473633
2207/3605	Good Lord try one throw One throw is soon made   And if I lose   You will	705.202880859375
2208/3605	But if I lose   Well you will surrender the harness	228.4207000732422
2209/3605	Have with you for one throw said DArtagn	76.10633087158203
2210/3605	Athos went in quest of the Englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy	252.48504638671875
2211/3605	He proposed the conditionsthe two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pist	346.3757629394531
2212/3605	The Englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred pist	228.03555297851562
2213/3605	DArtagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified Athos who however consented himself with saying Thats a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsie	194.1742401123047
2214/3605	The Englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the	331.2033386230469
2215/3605	He threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory DArtagnan turned aside to conceal his ill	98.5591812133789
2216/3605	Hold hold hold said Athos wit his quiet tone that throw of the dice is	1203.21044921875
2217/3605	I have not seen such a one four times in my	61.63460159301758

2219/3605	DArtagnan looked and was seized with	47.97199630737305
2220/3605	Then Monsieur takes his horse back again said the English	85.52320098876953
2221/3605	Then there is no revenge   Our conditions said No revenge you will please to recol	242.72996520996094
2222/3605	That is true the horse shall be restored to your lackey monsie	58.6936149597168
2223/3605	A moment said Athos with your permission monsieur I wish to speak a word with my	42.47914123535156
2224/3605	Well Tempter what more do you want with me said DArtagn	61.932655334472656

2227/3605	You know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your	172.56979370117188
2228/3605	Well then I repeat you are	133.64268493652344
2229/3605	What is the use of one horse for us two I could not ride	195.43728637695312
2230/3605	We should look like the two sons of Aymon who had lost their	933.6292724609375
2231/3605	You cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent	1794.02001953125
2232/3605	For my part I should not hesitate a moment I should take the hundred pist	57.54481887817383
2233/3605	We want money for our return to	100.92084503173828

2242/3605	Nothing nothing Go on   Your advice then   To take the hundred pistoles DArtagn	43.42578125

2246/3605	Take the hundred pistoles my friend take the hundred pistoles   DArtagnan only required one reason to be	51.396141052246094
2247/3605	Besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of Ath	368.2721252441406
2248/3605	He acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the Englishman paid down on the	298.57275390625

2252/3605	From a distance they perceived Aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like Sister Anne at the dust in the	318.21954345703125
2253/3605	_Holà_ Aramis What the devil are you doing there cried the two	207.76084899902344
2254/3605	Ah is that you DArtagnan and you Athos said the young	17.204757690429688
2255/3605	I was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave	130.1478271484375
2256/3605	My English horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the	239.13218688964844
2257/3605	Life itself may be resolved into three words _Erat est fuit	3523.669921875
2258/3605	Which means said DArtagnan who began to suspect the	39.24810028076172

2263/3605	At the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the Amiens road pulled up at the inn and Planchet and Grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their	147.24148559570312
2264/3605	The cart was returning empty to Paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to slake the wagoners thirst along the	483.8157043457031
2265/3605	What is this said Aramis on seeing them	113.86331176757812

2268/3605	_Holà_ Bazin Bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these	829.5709228515625
2269/3605	And what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked DArtagn	194.91293334960938
2270/3605	My dear fellow I invited them to a dinner the next day replied Aram	121.79532623291016
2271/3605	They have some capital wine hereplease to observe that in	3667.322998046875
2272/3605	I did my best to make them	160.6595458984375
2273/3605	Then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the Jesuit entreated me to get him made a Musket	196.56703186035156
2274/3605	Without a thesis cried DArtagnan without a thesis I demand the suppression of the	1572.5894775390625

2279/3605	It has four hundred lines and lasts a	1082.91064453125
2280/3605	My faith my dear Aramis said DArtagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did Latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two	225.19644165039062
2281/3605	You will see continued Aramis that it breathes irreproachable	1030.8760986328125
2282/3605	And so my friends we return to Paris Bravo I am	390.9839782714844

2284/3605	You cant think how I have missed him the great simple	178.5753936767578
2285/3605	To see him so selfsatisfied reconciles me with	538.9574584960938
2286/3605	He would not sell his horse not for a kingdom I think I can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome	243.4051055908203
2287/3605	I am sure he will look like the Great Mogul   They made a halt for an hour to refresh their	254.34896850585938
2288/3605	Aramis discharged his bill placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join Porth	132.86363220214844
2289/3605	They found him up less pale than when DArtagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four	100.06854248046875
2290/3605	This dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb	83462.46875

2294/3605	Besides here is a piquant _fricandeau_ and a fillet of	964.2506103515625
2295/3605	I am recruiting myself said Porthos I am recruiting	1030.1094970703125
2296/3605	Nothing weakens a man more than these devilish	3788.86376953125
2297/3605	Did you ever suffer from a strain Athos   Never Though I remember in our affair of the Rue Férou I received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same	158.72430419921875
2298/3605	But this dinner was not intended for you alone Porthos said Aram	60.19820022583008

2302/3605	_Pardieu_ replied DArtagnan for my part I am eating veal garnished with shrimps and	218.80319213867188
2303/3605	And I some lamb chops said Porth	7496.33642578125
2304/3605	And I a plain chicken said Aram	995.8108520507812
2305/3605	You are all mistaken gentlemen answered Athos gravely you are eating	254.1588897705078
2306/3605	Horse said Aramis with a grimace of	118.4175796508789
2307/3605	Are we not eating a horse Porthos And perhaps his saddle there	369.8060607910156
2308/3605	No gentlemen I have kept the harness said Porth	88.97777557373047
2309/3605	My faith said Aramis we are all	142.459716796875
2310/3605	One would think we had tipped the	20702.095703125
2311/3605	This horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and I dont like to humiliate	297.49639892578125
2312/3605	Then your duchess is still at the waters asked DArtagn	54.006866455078125
2313/3605	And my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen I expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that I gave him to	151.31192016601562
2314/3605	My God yes _gave_ that is the word said Porthos for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis and the stingy fellow would only give me	133.94361877441406
2315/3605	You will observe gentlemen said Athos that Porthos has made the best bargain of any of	74.72709655761719
2316/3605	And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor Porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his	109.0614242553711
2317/3605	There is one comfort we are all in cash said DArtagn	69.5324935913086
2318/3605	Well for my part said Athos I found Aramiss Spanish wine so good that I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lac	272.74249267578125
2319/3605	And I said Aramis imagined that I had given almost my last sou to the church of Montdidier and the Jesuits of Amiens with whom I had made engagements which I ought to have	128.6251220703125
2320/3605	I have ordered Masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which I have not the least doubt you will be marvelously	659.0352783203125
2321/3605	Ay ay said Athos exchanging a smile with DArtagnan and Aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good	71.12677764892578
2322/3605	In short said Porthos when all my expenses are paid I shall have at most thirty crowns	230.64634704589844
2323/3605	And I about ten pistoles said Aram	119.0487289428711
2324/3605	Well then it appears that we are the Crœsuses of the	641.2369384765625
2325/3605	How much have you left of your hundred pistoles DArtagnan   Of my hundred pistoles Why in the first place I gave you	49.72133255004883
2326/3605	You think so   _Pardieu_   Ah that is	12.98684024810791
2327/3605	What a brute of a host Why did you give him six pistoles   You told me to give them to	67.68875122070312
2328/3605	It is true I am too goodnat	56.118247985839844
2329/3605	In brief how much remains   Twentyfive pistoles said DArtagn	83.43994140625
2330/3605	And I said Athos taking some small change from his pocket I   You Nothing   My faith So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general	166.07493591308594
2331/3605	Now then let us calculate how much we posses in	1042.177490234375
2332/3605	Four hundred and seventyfive livres said DArtagnan who reckoned like Archim	165.89923095703125
2333/3605	On our arrival in Paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said Porth	124.2803955078125
2334/3605	Well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw	113.31539154052734
2335/3605	There   Let us dine then said Porthos it is getting	29.359216690063477
2336/3605	The friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton Bazin Planchet and Grim	72.59654235839844
2337/3605	On arriving in Paris DArtagnan found a letter from	44.63362121582031
2338/3605	de Tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the Musket	82.02420806884766
2339/3605	As this was the height of DArtagnans worldly ambitionapart be it well understood from his desire of finding M	398.11468505859375

2341/3605	They were assembled in council at the residence of Athos which always indicated an event of some	245.00799560546875

2343/3605	The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilder	429.7578430175781
2344/3605	de Tréville never jested in matters relating to	771.8372192382812
2345/3605	And what do you reckon your outfit will cost said DArtagn	185.3014373779297
2346/3605	We have made our calculations with Spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred liv	1525.287109375
2347/3605	Four times fifteen makes sixtysix thousand livres said Ath	208.6318817138672
2348/3605	It seems to me said DArtagnan with a thousand livres eachI do not speak as a Spartan but as a procurator   This word _procurator_ roused Porth	106.8257827758789
2349/3605	Stop said he I have an	43.385433197021484
2350/3605	Well thats something for I have not the shadow of one said Athos coolly but as to DArtagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to _ours_ has driven him out of his	113.0214614868164
2351/3605	A thousand livres For my part I declare I want two	110.37242889404297
2352/3605	Four times two makes eight then said Aramis it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the sadd	423.0999450683594
2353/3605	Besides said Athos waiting till DArtagnan who went to thank Monsieur de Tréville had shut the door besides there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our	61.84648132324219
2354/3605	What the devil DArtagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his	108.33025360107422
2355/3605	To this preoccupation of his vanity DArtagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less	90.45088195800781
2356/3605	Bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of	113.1423568725586

2358/3605	The queen was ignorant where the mercers young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure DArtagn	221.60595703125
2359/3605	Athos did not leave his chamber he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip	109.7704086303711
2360/3605	It will then be said of me that I died for the king so that I shall have performed my duty without the expense of an	199.4503173828125
2361/3605	Porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating I shall follow up on my	203.23919677734375
2362/3605	Aramis anxious and negligently dressed said	600.9125366210938
2363/3605	It may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the	1265.318115234375
2364/3605	The lackeys on their part like the coursers of Hippolytus shared the sadness of their	2855.41259765625
2365/3605	The three friendsfor as we have said Athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himselfwent out early in the morning and returned late at	508.3550720214844
2366/3605	They wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind	115.39567565917969
2367/3605	They might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they	912.1544189453125
2368/3605	When they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say Have you found anything   However as Porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to	137.1499481201172
2369/3605	He was a man of execution this worthy Porth	62.978546142578125
2370/3605	DArtagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of	61.469886779785156
2371/3605	He entered after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant	1391.0345458984375
2372/3605	As DArtagnan took some precautions to conceal himself Porthos believed he had not been	43.851131439208984
2373/3605	Porthos went and leaned against the side of a	46.07756042480469
2374/3605	DArtagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other	42.242984771728516
2375/3605	There happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of	213.89529418945312
2376/3605	Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the	303.07452392578125
2377/3605	Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the	184.10516357421875
2378/3605	DArtagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which Porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black	444.2707214355469
2379/3605	The eyes of Porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the n	351.07421875
2380/3605	On her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos and then immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anx	72.33231353759766
2381/3605	It was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her	342.3421630859375
2382/3605	The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of Porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little Negro and the maidserv	787.0145874023438
2383/3605	It was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained	1788.1903076171875
2384/3605	Then she cried Ahem under cover of the _mea culpa_ striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward	1096.1192626953125
2385/3605	Nevertheless he understood it all but was	574.736083984375
2386/3605	DArtagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos which amused him	70.08138275146484
2387/3605	He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurators wife of the Rue aux Ours which was the more probable from the church of	650.2655029296875
2388/3605	Leu being not far from that	4066.0126953125
2389/3605	He guessed likewise by induction that Porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of Chantilly when the procurators wife had proved so refractory with respect to her	891.8404541015625
2390/3605	Amid all this DArtagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of Porth	87.62557983398438
2391/3605	There were only chimeras and illusions but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras   The sermon over the procurators wife advanced toward the holy	2017.2603759765625
2392/3605	Porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand	213.1034698486328
2393/3605	The procurators wife smiled thinking that it was for her Porthos had put himself to this trouble but she was cruelly and promptly unde	276.5246887207031
2394/3605	When she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her	138.29478454589844

2397/3605	This was too much for the procurators wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and Porth	296.6025085449219
2398/3605	Ah said he you have remarked   I must have been blind not to have	52.872840881347656
2399/3605	Monsieur Porthos said the procurators wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes I have something to say to	76.93396759033203
2400/3605	Certainly madame said Porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pl	89.6241683959961
2401/3605	At that moment DArtagnan passed in pursuit of Milady he cast a passing glance at Porthos and beheld this triumphant	83.58541107177734
2402/3605	Magloirea littlefrequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each	2283.606689453125
2403/3605	In the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at	619.1018676757812
2404/3605	And that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat   Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman M	139.3437042236328
2405/3605	Porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a	141.78871154785156
2406/3605	Ah you are quite the pet of the ladies Monsieur Porthos resumed the procurators wife with a	169.41566467285156
2407/3605	Well responded Porthos you may imagine with the physique with which nature has endowed me I am not in want of good	157.5914764404297
2408/3605	Good Lord how quickly men forget cried the procurators wife raising her eyes toward	2521.77392578125
2409/3605	Less quickly than the women it seems to me replied Porthos for I madame I may say I was your victim when wounded dying I was abandoned by the	131.59912109375
2410/3605	But Monsieur Porthos murmured the procurators wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was	88.45862579345703
2411/3605	I who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de   I know it	93.81995391845703
2412/3605	The Comtesse de   Monsieur Porthos be generous   You are right madame and I will not	27.411788940429688
2413/3605	But it was my husband who would not hear of	520.6622924804688
2414/3605	Madame Coquenard said Porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which I preserve engraved in my	308.0738525390625
2415/3605	Besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather	732.1831665039062
2416/3605	Madame Coquenard I gave you the	1209.703125
2417/3605	I had but to write to the Duchessebut I wont repeat her name for I am incapable of compromising a woman but this I know that I had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen	129.1155548095703
2418/3605	Monsieur Porthos said she I can assure you that you have severely punished me and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to	50.021522521972656
2419/3605	Fie madame fie said Porthos as if	291.8775329589844
2420/3605	Let us not talk about money if you please it is	123.10979461669922
2421/3605	Then you no longer love me said the procurators wife slowly and	1026.015625
2422/3605	And that is the only reply you make Alas I	255.4773406982422
2423/3605	Think of the offense you have committed toward me madame It remains _here_ said Porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it	188.84548950195312
2424/3605	I will repair it indeed I will my dear Porth	99.9122085571289
2425/3605	Besides what did I ask of you resumed Porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good	147.25848388671875
2426/3605	A loan nothing more After all I am not an unreasonable	824.6055908203125
2427/3605	I know you are not rich Madame Coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from	291.08392333984375
2428/3605	Oh If you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardon	65.7303466796875
2429/3605	Please to know Monsieur Porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurators wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected min	580.0494995117188
2430/3605	That doubles the offense said Porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurators wife for if you are rich Madame Coquenard then there is no excuse for your	520.7619018554688
2431/3605	When I said rich replied the procurators wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word	548.1210327148438
2432/3605	I am not precisely rich though I am pretty well	204.0218963623047
2433/3605	Hold madame said Porthos let us say no more upon the subject I beg of	25.549257278442383
2434/3605	You have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between	1020.0243530273438
2435/3605	Ingrate that you are   Ah I advise you to complain said Porth	41.09599304199219
2436/3605	Begone then to your beautiful duchess I will detain you no	102.34835052490234
2437/3605	And she is not to be despised in my	49.55171203613281
2438/3605	Something whispers me so continued Porthos becoming more and more	142.60447692871094
2439/3605	Rather say that you have a new	82.36934661865234
2440/3605	Not so I speak frankly to	191.4535675048828
2441/3605	No object affects me and I even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for	179.08045959472656
2442/3605	But in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to	120.69224548339844
2443/3605	I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my	376.9225769042969
2444/3605	Then I must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of Brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my	268.09271240234375
2445/3605	Porthos observed a last struggle between love and avar	121.13002014160156
2446/3605	And as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey	188.07301330566406
2447/3605	Journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in	2996.0205078125
2448/3605	Have you no friends in Paris then Monsieur Porthos said the procurators	196.3336944580078
2449/3605	I thought I had said Porthos resuming his melancholy air but I have been taught my	59.94092559814453
2450/3605	You have some cried the procurators wife in a transport that surprised even	2162.794189453125
2451/3605	You are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from Noyon in Picardy you have several lawsuits and no	709.295654296875
2452/3605	Can you recollect all that   Perfectly mad	24.192554473876953
2453/3605	And be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventysix	656.0535278320312
2454/3605	Seventysix years _Peste_ Thats a fine age replied Porth	113.0118179321289
2455/3605	A great age you mean Monsieur Porth	56.52043151855469
2456/3605	Yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at Porth	105.6841812133789
2457/3605	Fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes	2350.25830078125
2458/3605	You are a woman of precaution I see my dear Madame Coquenard said Porthos squeezing the hand of the procurators wife tender	726.4049072265625
2459/3605	We are then reconciled dear Monsieur Porthos said she sim	353.0846252441406
2460/3605	For life replied Porthos in the same	27.653682708740234
2461/3605	DARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN     DArtagnan followed Milady without being perceived by	59788.66796875
2462/3605	He saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to	168.94752502441406
2463/3605	It was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful	208.11561584472656
2464/3605	DArtagnan therefore returned to the Rue Fé	24.326244354248047
2465/3605	In the Rue de Seine he met Planchet who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing	272.44561767578125
2466/3605	He ordered him to go and saddle two horses in	214.74977111816406
2467/3605	de Trévilles stablesone for himself DArtagnan and one for Planchetand bring them to Athoss	179.61419677734375
2468/3605	Once for all Tréville had placed his stable at DArtagnans	152.51568603515625
2469/3605	Planchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier and DArtagnan toward the Rue Fé	43.490623474121094
2470/3605	Athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous Spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into Picard	255.3268280029297
2471/3605	He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for DArtagnan and Grimaud obeyed as	28.914169311523438
2472/3605	DArtagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between Porthos and the procurators wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be	163.41009521484375
2473/3605	As for me replied Athos to this recital I am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my	132.8392333984375
2474/3605	Handsome wellbred noble lord as you are my dear Athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicit	584.4229736328125
2475/3605	How young this DArtagnan is said Athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to Grimaud to bring another	31.856576919555664
2476/3605	At that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the halfopen door and told his master that the horses were	118.35260009765625
2477/3605	Two horses that Monsieur de Tréville lends me at my pleasure and with which I am now going to take a ride to	99.53527069091797
2478/3605	Well and what are you going to do at	49.940757751464844
2479/3605	Then DArtagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind	186.60096740722656
2480/3605	That is to say you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame Bonacieux said Athos shrugging his shoulders contemptuously as if he pitied human	53.37261199951172
2481/3605	I am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is	251.92666625976562
2482/3605	I do not know why but I imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as I am has an influence over my	67.8778076171875
2483/3605	Well perhaps you are right said Ath	23.142030715942383
2484/3605	I do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once	76.38372802734375
2485/3605	Madame Bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is	103.06390380859375
2486/3605	What is to be said I must divert my attention   Amuse yourself with Milady my dear DArtagnan I wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse	86.40165710449219
2487/3605	Instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to	295.4419250488281
2488/3605	My dear fellow said Athos I ride horses when I have any when I have none I go a	163.1991424560547
2489/3605	Well said DArtagnan smiling at the misanthropy of Athos which from any other person would have offended him I ride what I can get I am not so proud as	61.19054412841797
2490/3605	_Au revoir_ said the Musketeer making a sign to Grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just	156.63099670410156
2491/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet mounted and took the road to	22.00313377380371
2492/3605	All along the road what Athos had said respecting M	957.2235717773438
2493/3605	Bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young	20.823686599731445
2494/3605	Although DArtagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercers pretty wife had made a real impression upon his	224.9795379638672
2495/3605	As he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to	94.00830841064453
2496/3605	Meantime he was going to try to find out Mil	92.38848876953125
2497/3605	Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew	132.3291015625
2498/3605	Now in the opinion of DArtagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off M	95.0826644897461
2499/3605	Bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the	45.969730377197266
2500/3605	DArtagnan then only halflied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of Milady he at the same time went in search of Const	177.9072723388672
2501/3605	Thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse DArtagnan completed his short journey and arrived at	121.3220443725586
2502/3605	He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later Louis	80.54548645019531
2503/3605	This person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with	88.64961242675781
2504/3605	Eh monsieur said he addressing DArtagnan dont you remember that face which is blinking yonder   No said DArtagnan and yet I am certain it is not the first time I have seen that vis	29.83641815185547
2505/3605	_Parbleu_ I believe it is not said Planc	39.365814208984375
2506/3605	Why it is poor Lubin the lackey of the Comte de Wardeshe whom you took such good care of a month ago at Calais on the road to the governors country house   So it is said DArtagnan I know him	199.7987060546875
2507/3605	Do you think he would recollect you   My faith monsieur he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of	67.35596466064453
2508/3605	Well go and talk with the boy said DArtagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is	84.39714050292969
2509/3605	At the end of an instants observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw Miladys carriage stop opposite to	171.7939910888672
2510/3605	He could not be mistaken Milady was in	85.53543090820312
2511/3605	DArtagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being	27.75285530090332
2512/3605	Milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her	311.2041015625
2513/3605	The maid approached Planchet whom she took for Lubin and holding out a little billet to him said For your	426.8624267578125
2514/3605	Thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove	116.00873565673828
2515/3605	Then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met DArtagnan who having seen all was coming to	84.54230499267578
2516/3605	For you monsieur said Planchet presenting the billet to the young	25.48920440673828
2517/3605	For me said DArtagnan are you sure of that   _Pardieu_ monsieur I cant be more	16.504199981689453
2518/3605	Oh said DArtagnan this is rather warm it appears that Milady and I are anxious about the health of the same	63.54735565185547
2519/3605	As I said monsieur Lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the	192.5004425048828
2520/3605	Well done Planchet you are the king of lac	76.22817993164062
2521/3605	Now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the	330.0364074707031
2522/3605	At the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside a cavalier richly dressed was close to the	69.5097885131836
2523/3605	The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that DArtagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his	121.65184020996094
2524/3605	The conversation took place in Englisha language which DArtagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful Englishwoman was in a great	166.9466552734375
2525/3605	She terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand	246.97706604003906
2526/3605	The cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate Milady still	249.76742553710938
2527/3605	DArtagnan thought this was the moment to	31.360973358154297
2528/3605	He approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said Madame will you permit me to offer you my services It appears to me that this cavalier has made you very	57.25420379638672
2529/3605	Speak one word madame and I take upon myself to punish him for his want of	140.63943481445312
2530/3605	At the first word Milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good French Monsieur I should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my	124.2017822265625
2531/3605	You must be aware that I was ignorant of that mad	23.88840103149414
2532/3605	What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about cried the cavalier whom Milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach	412.9097595214844
2533/3605	Why does not he go about his business   Stupid fellow yourself said DArtagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage	142.47152709960938
2534/3605	I do not go on because it pleases me to stop	57.734825134277344
2535/3605	The cavalier addressed some words in English to his	216.80921936035156
2536/3605	I speak to you in French said DArtagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same	31.965534210205078
2537/3605	You are Madames brother I learnbe it so but fortunately you are not	778.8164672851562
2538/3605	The carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated	380.8845520019531
2539/3605	Well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than I am for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us	45.46654510498047
2540/3605	Ah said the Englishman is it you my master It seems you must always be playing some game or	124.00572967529297
2541/3605	Yes and that reminds me that I have a revenge to	54.035614013671875
2542/3605	We will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice	174.64544677734375
2543/3605	You see plainly that I have no sword said the English	54.0869140625
2544/3605	Do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man   I hope you have a sword at home but at all events I have two and if you like I will throw with you for one of	88.45208740234375
2545/3605	Needless said the Englishman I am well furnished with such play	671.209228515625
2546/3605	Very well my worthy gentleman replied DArtagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this	171.4983673095703
2547/3605	Where if you please   Behind the Luxembourg thats a charming spot for such amusements as the one I propose to	102.35259246826172
2548/3605	That will do I will be	86.24713134765625
2549/3605	_A propos_ you have probably one or two friends   I have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with	223.5844268798828
2550/3605	Three Marvelous That falls out oddly Three is just my number   Now then who are you asked the English	1244.0081787109375
2551/3605	I am Monsieur dArtagnan a Gascon gentleman serving in the kings Musket	37.755210876464844
2552/3605	And you   I am Lord de Winter Baron	703.8178100585938
2553/3605	Well then I am your servant Monsieur Baron said DArtagnan though you have names rather difficult to recol	78.03253173828125
2554/3605	And touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to	271.9441223144531
2555/3605	As he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence DArtagnan went straight to the residence of Ath	37.03575134277344
2556/3605	He found Athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find	93.46977996826172
2557/3605	He related to Athos all that had passed except the letter to	66.19339752197266
2558/3605	Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an English	93.07736206054688
2559/3605	We might say that was his	154.9688720703125
2560/3605	They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the	75.04071044921875
2561/3605	Porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a	154.06710815429688
2562/3605	Aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in Athoss closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing	203.8642578125
2563/3605	Athos by signs desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of	326.8314208984375
2564/3605	DArtagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they	167.30909729003906
2565/3605	ENGLISH AND FRENCH     The hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the Luxembourg given up to the feeding of	3486.8583984375
2566/3605	Athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to	213.75173950195312
2567/3605	The lackeys were ordered to act as sentin	104.2508544921875
2568/3605	A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the Musket	366.3968811035156
2569/3605	Then according to foreign custom the presentations took	3628.989990234375
2570/3605	The Englishmen were all men of rank consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise but of	399.05206298828125
2571/3605	But after all said Lord de Winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you	40.619873046875
2572/3605	We cannot fight with such names they are names of shepher	168.8283233642578
2573/3605	Therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said Ath	204.3905487060547
2574/3605	Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the English	116.42124938964844
2575/3605	You played very willingly with us without knowing our names said Athos by the same token that you won our	303.63665771484375
2576/3605	That is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our	245.50782775878906
2577/3605	One plays with anybody but one fights only with	2230.9541015625
2578/3605	And that is but just said Athos and he took aside the one of the four Englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low	63.48051452636719
2579/3605	Does that satisfy you said Athos to his	99.88677215576172
2580/3605	Do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me   Yes monsieur said the Englishman b	40.47747039794922
2581/3605	Well now shall I tell you something added Athos co	94.793701171875
2582/3605	Why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself	103.65093994140625
2583/3605	Why so   Because I am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know I am living so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the	152.5644989013672
2584/3605	The Englishman looked at Athos believing that he jested but Athos did not jest the least in the	62.86126708984375
2585/3605	Gentlemen said Athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready   Yes answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen as with one	113.23751068115234
2586/3605	Immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice	749.907470703125
2587/3605	Athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing	505.5345764160156
2588/3605	Porthos abated no doubt of his toogreat confidence by his adventure of Chantilly played with skill and prud	396.43365478515625
2589/3605	Aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in	334.6236267089844
2590/3605	He hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one the sword pierced his	314.1839294433594
2591/3605	Second Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh As the Englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his	82.7425765991211
2592/3605	Aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lac	493.7488098144531
2593/3605	As to DArtagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword	179.78025817871094
2594/3605	The baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell	195.76174926757812
2595/3605	DArtagnan was over him at a bound and said to the Englishman pointing his sword to his throat I could kill you my Lord you are completely in my hands but I spare your life for the sake of your	66.19828796386719
2596/3605	DArtagnan was at the height of joy he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his	382.1144714355469
2597/3605	As Porthos and Aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his	119.33501434326172
2598/3605	DArtagnan picked it up and offered it to Lord de	21.824373245239258
2599/3605	What the devil would you have me do with that said the English	38.54392623901367
2600/3605	You can restore it to his family said DArtagn	30.633708953857422
2601/3605	His family will care much about such a trifle as that His family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from	219.48240661621094
2602/3605	DArtagnan put the purse into his	21.07105255126953
2603/3605	DArtagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of ass	32.991703033447266
2604/3605	At this time Athos came up to DArtagn	17.750823974609375
2605/3605	What do you mean to do with that purse whispered	76.63282775878906
2606/3605	Why I meant to pass it over to you my dear Ath	44.95869445800781
2607/3605	Me why to me   Why you killed him They are the spoils of	209.04714965820312
2608/3605	Porthos shrugged his shoulders Aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed Ath	208.3123016357422
2609/3605	Then said DArtagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as Lord de Winter desired us to	33.923248291015625
2610/3605	Yes said Athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the English	40.24795913696289
2611/3605	Athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coach	42.72781753540039
2612/3605	This greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even Porthos and this French generosity repeated by Lord de Winter and his friend was highly applauded except by	556.964599609375
2613/3605	Lord de Winter on quitting DArtagnan gave him his sisters	85.98616790771484
2614/3605	She lived in the Place Royalethen the fashionable quarterat Number 6 and he undertook to call and take DArtagnan with him in order to introduce	251.6165771484375
2615/3605	DArtagnan appointed eight oclock at Athoss	77.7513656616211
2616/3605	This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon	1622.60791015625
2617/3605	He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his	118.72429656982422
2618/3605	According to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot	240.81472778320312
2619/3605	His only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of	405.47540283203125
2620/3605	Then she knew that he was one of the friends of	31.584651947021484
2621/3605	de Tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to Milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with	174.64443969726562
2622/3605	As to the commencement of an intrigue between her and	209.25198364257812
2623/3605	de Wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinals	777.0596313476562
2624/3605	It is not for nothing we are but twenty years old above all if we were born at Tar	163.1065673828125
2625/3605	DArtagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to Athoss and according to custom related everything to	138.09788513183594
2626/3605	Athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of	252.30860900878906
2627/3605	What said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after	267.9789733886719
2628/3605	DArtagnan felt the truth of this rep	33.03278732299805
2629/3605	I loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart while I only love Milady with my head said	137.4513702392578
2630/3605	In getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at	593.6707763671875
2631/3605	The part she plays _pardieu_ It is not difficult to divine that after all you have told	76.53309631347656
2632/3605	She is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your	60.99641036987305
2633/3605	The devil my dear Athos you view things on the dark side meth	431.75537109375
2634/3605	Can it be otherwise I bought my experience dearlyparticularly fair	7328.85986328125
2635/3605	Milady is fair you say   She has the most beautiful light hair imaginable   Ah my poor DArtagnan said Ath	69.99565124511719
2636/3605	Listen to me I want to be enlightened on a subject then when I shall have learned what I desire to know I will	71.77051544189453
2637/3605	Lord de Winter arrived at the appointed time but Athos being warned of his coming went into the other	110.18437194824219
2638/3605	He therefore found DArtagnan alone and as it was nearly eight oclock he took the young man with	33.210052490234375
2639/3605	An elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the Place	119.20368957519531
2640/3605	Thank him then madame if you have any affection for	31.16006088256836
2641/3605	Milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at	182.5266876220703
2642/3605	The brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with Miladys favorite monkey which had pulled him by the double	202.92059326171875
2643/3605	You are welcome monsieur said Milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of illhumor which DArtagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my	128.42747497558594
2644/3605	The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single	1046.9906005859375
2645/3605	Milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to	195.83160400390625
2646/3605	The blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her	284.27850341796875
2647/3605	Lord de Winter perceived nothing of	188.97042846679688
2648/3605	When he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and	159.51254272460938
2649/3605	He filled two glasses and by a sign invited DArtagnan to	109.09960174560547
2650/3605	DArtagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to refuse to pledge	182.4263458251953
2651/3605	He therefore drew near to the table and took the second	78.4671859741211
2652/3605	He did not however lose sight of Milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her	74.73407745361328
2653/3605	Now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her count	264.8236999511719
2654/3605	She bit her handkerchief with her beautiful	85.0165786743164
2655/3605	That pretty little _soubrette_ whom DArtagnan had already observed then came	268.5579528808594
2656/3605	She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English who thereupon requested DArtagnans permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his	165.14935302734375
2657/3605	DArtagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter and then returned to Mil	45.81644821166992
2658/3605	Her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood	701.0668334960938
2659/3605	Those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of	461.9543762207031
2660/3605	She told DArtagnan that Lord de Winter was her brotherinlaw and not her	35.4161376953125
2661/3605	She had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one	190.71844482421875
2662/3605	This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter if Lord de Winter did not	71.39252471923828
2663/3605	All this showed DArtagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this	107.32364654541016
2664/3605	In addition to this after a half hours conversation DArtagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that	323.6692810058594
2665/3605	DArtagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of	267.9558410644531
2666/3605	To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon Milady replied with a smile of	97.26918029785156
2667/3605	The hour came for him to	207.2217254638672
2668/3605	DArtagnan took leave of Milady and left the saloon the happiest of	93.37368774414062
2669/3605	On the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_ who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted	283.3360290527344
2670/3605	DArtagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening	48.69721221923828
2671/3605	Lord de Winter was not at home and it was Milady who this time did all the honors of the	64.43365478515625
2672/3605	She appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the	162.97027587890625
2673/3605	DArtagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding Mil	172.7017364501953
2674/3605	He launched into a eulogy of his Eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the kings Guards if he had happened to know	266.9996643066406
2675/3605	Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked DArtagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in	99.65850830078125
2676/3605	DArtagnan replied that he had been sent thither by	39.40575408935547
2677/3605	de Tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as	181.51058959960938
2678/3605	Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips she had to deal with a Gascon who played	120.5970458984375
2679/3605	At the same hour as on the preceding evening DArtagnan	34.89665222167969
2680/3605	In the corridor he again met the pretty Kitty that was the name of the _soubrette	404.0177001953125
2681/3605	She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but DArtagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but	45.35874938964844
2682/3605	DArtagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day Milady gave him a more gracious	85.7288589477539
2683/3605	Every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty _soubrette	240.90628051757812
2684/3605	But as we have said DArtagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor	111.61090850830078
2685/3605	A PROCURATORS DINNER     However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurators	2706.924072265625
2686/3605	On the morrow he received the last touches of Mousquetons brush for an hour and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with	191.07516479492188
2687/3605	His heart beat but not like DArtagnans with a young and impatient	166.31736755371094
2688/3605	No a more material interest stirred his	2094.794189453125
2689/3605	He was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of	445.06500244140625
2690/3605	And yet at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some	144.8218536376953
2691/3605	A shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the	1611.403076171875
2692/3605	In all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive client	518.4175415039062
2693/3605	Although the Musketeer was not expected before one oclock the procurators wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his	278.83294677734375
2694/3605	Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward	239.49380493164062
2695/3605	The clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tonguet	1758.5673828125
2696/3605	It is my cousin cried the procurators	2992.094482421875
2697/3605	Come in come in Monsieur Porthos   The name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but Porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its	90.4992904663086
2698/3605	They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have	83.73456573486328
2699/3605	This last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with	1700.5496826171875
2700/3605	On quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception	169.9735870361328
2701/3605	All these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire Porthos	300.54266357421875
2702/3605	Words might be heard at a distance through all these open	149.75180053710938
2703/3605	The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courte	149.1742401123047
2704/3605	We are cousins it appears Monsieur Porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane	488.1211853027344
2705/3605	The old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and	139.35374450683594
2706/3605	His little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life	625.7431640625
2707/3605	Unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony	585.919677734375
2708/3605	During the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his	218.2390594482422
2709/3605	The cousin was received with resignation that was	415.34503173828125
2710/3605	Coquenard firm upon his legs would have declined all relationship with	2464.569580078125
2711/3605	Yes monsieur we are cousins said Porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the	195.05648803710938
2712/3605	By the female side I believe said the procurator malicious	8520.5224609375
2713/3605	Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large	119.69404602050781
2714/3605	Coquenard who knew that a simpleminded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great	604.3692016601562
2715/3605	Coquenard had since the arrival of Porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak	132.79800415039062
2716/3605	Porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the	163.35594177246094
2717/3605	Oh my legs my poor legs where are you murmured Coquenard and he tried to	613.496826171875
2718/3605	This succor which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the Musketeer toward the procurators	463.1131591796875
2719/3605	They passed into the eating rooma large dark room situated opposite the	606.0961303710938
2720/3605	The clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit	349.3616943359375
2721/3605	Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threaten	177962.109375
2722/3605	Coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by M	1560.169189453125
2723/3605	Coquenard whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the	265.79302978515625
2724/3605	He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his	155.84017944335938
2725/3605	Oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather	267.4258728027344
2726/3605	What the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said Porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipel	239.25218200683594
2727/3605	Coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his	397.0713806152344
2728/3605	Coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient	1525.3641357421875
2729/3605	After the soup the maid brought a boiled fowla piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to	159.20790100097656
2730/3605	One may see that you love your family Madame Coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost	784.2595825195312
2731/3605	You are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely   The poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their	524.15625
2732/3605	The fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch to which it had retired to die of old	71.8103256225586
2733/3605	The devil thought Porthos this is poor	161.7601776123047
2734/3605	I respect old age but I dont much like it boiled or	2515.295166015625
2735/3605	And he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his	141.03128051757812
2736/3605	In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearancean enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show	470.22222900390625
2737/3605	But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned counten	3879.512939453125
2738/3605	Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good house	1355.54052734375
2739/3605	Coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to Porthos and M	212.1856231689453
2740/3605	The young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do	189.96231079101562
2741/3605	This brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale top	146.05120849609375
2742/3605	Porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurators wife under the table as it came in search of	149.8556671142578
2743/3605	He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuilthe terror of all expert pal	549.9660034179688
2744/3605	Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed	3634.75341796875
2745/3605	Will you eat any of these beans Cousin Porthos said M	2760.709716796875
2746/3605	Coquenard in that tone which says Take my advice dont touch	509.661376953125
2747/3605	Devil take me if I taste one of them murmured Porthos to himself and then said aloud Thank you my cousin I am no longer	84.83645629882812
2748/3605	The procurator repeated several times Ah Madame Coquenard Accept my compliments your dinner has been a real	2012.5045166015625
2749/3605	Lord how I have eaten  	131.9775390625
2750/3605	Coquenard had eaten his soup the black feet of the fowl and the only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of	304.4366455078125
2751/3605	Porthos fancied they were mystifying him and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows but the knee of M	330.37713623046875
2752/3605	Coquenard gently advised him to be	750.2465209960938
2753/3605	This silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to Porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the	152.8660430908203
2754/3605	Upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from M	453.7029113769531

2756/3605	Go young men go and promote digestion by working said the procurator grave	2686.80908203125
2757/3605	Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and	4835.255859375
2758/3605	Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good	610.3587036132812

2763/3605	Coquenard did not seem to observe	249.44607543945312
2764/3605	This is fine said Porthos to himself I am prettily caught   He passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of M	510.65289306640625
2765/3605	Now said he the sacrifice is consummated Ah if I had not the hope of peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husbands chest  	316.84625244140625
2766/3605	Coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a s	462.67901611328125
2767/3605	The procurators wife took Porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a	429.8058166503906
2768/3605	You can come and dine three times a week said M	249.48342895507812
2769/3605	Thanks madame said Porthos but I dont like to abuse your kindness besides I must think of my outfit   Thats true said the procurators wife groaning that unfortunate outfit   Alas yes said Porthos it is	131.8700408935547
2770/3605	But of what then does the equipment of your company consist Monsieur Porthos   Oh of many things said Porth	57.13502502441406
2771/3605	The Musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen or the	658.9409790039062
2772/3605	Why they may amount to said Porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by	200.8492431640625
2773/3605	I hope it does not exceed She stopped speech failed	5542.2578125
2774/3605	Oh no said Porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres I even think that with economy I could manage it with two thousand liv	134.94969177246094
2775/3605	Good God cried she two thousand livres Why that is a fortune   Porthos made a most significant grimace M	140.2032012939453
2776/3605	I wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business I was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay	253.8334503173828
2777/3605	Ah ah said Porthos that is what you meant to say   Yes dear Monsieur Porth	14.095820426940918
2778/3605	Thus for instance dont you in the first place want a horse   Yes a	101.11810302734375
2779/3605	Well then I can just suit	237.40660095214844
2780/3605	Ah said Porthos brightening thats well as regards my horse but I must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a Musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred liv	247.52542114257812
2781/3605	Three hundred livres Then put down three hundred livres said the procurators wife with a	535.2454223632812
2782/3605	It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from	168.61070251464844
2783/3605	These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his	597.3944702148438
2784/3605	Then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my val	80.22554016113281
2785/3605	As to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them I have	104.20616912841797
2786/3605	A horse for your lackey resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my	666.310791015625
2787/3605	But then you understand Madame Coquenard a mule with feathers and	1479.6458740234375
2788/3605	Oh dont let that disturb you cried M	878.3383178710938

2790/3605	There is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the	313.9257507324219
2791/3605	Your valise is then empty asked Porthos with	178.59796142578125
2792/3605	Certainly it is empty replied the procurators wife in real	2748.625244140625
2793/3605	Ah but the valise I want cried Porthos is a wellfilled one my	306.3858947753906
2794/3605	Molière had not written his scene in LAvare	2170.57080078125
2795/3605	Coquenard was in the dilemma of Harp	3976.576416015625
2796/3605	These conditions being agreed to Porthos took leave of M	291.0110778808594
2797/3605	The latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but Porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurators wife was obliged to give place to the	377.0635070800781

2800/3605	Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the selfsatisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to	323.45404052734375
2801/3605	Good thought DArtagnan She is charged with some message for me from her mistress she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to	71.16718292236328
2802/3605	And he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air	314.600830078125
2803/3605	I wish to say three words to you Monsieur Chevalier stammered the _soubrette	104.8753433227539

2806/3605	Well what is to be done   If Monsieur Chevalier would follow me said Kitty timid	54.86183547973633
2807/3605	And Kitty who had not let go the hand of DArtagnan led him up a little dark winding staircase and after ascending about fifteen steps opened a	122.89335632324219
2808/3605	Come in here Monsieur Chevalier said she here we shall be alone and can	55.25179672241211

2810/3605	She will not hear what we say she never goes to bed before	205.25265502929688
2811/3605	The little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which Kitty said led to Miladys	377.3901672363281
2812/3605	Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep	88.4301986694336
2813/3605	You love my mistress then very dearly Monsieur Chevalier said	135.32672119140625
2814/3605	Oh more than I can say Kitty I am mad for her   Kitty breathed a second	231.78846740722656
2815/3605	Alas monsieur said she that is too	32.36051940917969
2816/3605	What the devil do you see so bad in it said DArtagn	22.534671783447266
2817/3605	Because monsieur replied Kitty my mistress loves you not at	163.92080688476562
2818/3605	_Hein_ said DArtagnan can she have charged you to tell me so   Oh no monsieur but out of the regard I have for you I have taken the resolution to tell you	45.117855072021484
2819/3605	Much obliged my dear Kitty but for the intention onlyfor the information you must agree is not likely to be at all	296.2433166503906
2820/3605	That is to say you dont believe what I have told you is it not so   We have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self	80.50873565673828
2821/3605	Then you dont believe me   I confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance   What do you think of this   Kitty drew a little note from her bos	40.75596618652344
2822/3605	For me said DArtagnan seizing the	22.488386154174805

2825/3605	As quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was	80.33154296875
2826/3605	Oh good Lord Monsieur Chevalier said she what are you doing   I said DArtagnan nothing and he read   You have not answered my first	34.300079345703125

2830/3605	Poor dear Monsieur dArtagnan said Kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans	77.59236907958984
2831/3605	You pity me little one said DArtagn	47.31868362426758
2832/3605	Oh yes and with all my heart for I know what it is to be in	43.469642639160156

2840/3605	Kitty said he I will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like dont let that disturb	153.90139770507812
2841/3605	And he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a	223.97518920898438

2854/3605	Here am I Milady here am I cried Kitty springing forward to meet her	524.6555786132812
2855/3605	Both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open DArtagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her	110.84219360351562

2865/3605	DArtagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindness	234.623046875
2866/3605	For all this continued Milady I should long ago have revenged myself on him if and I dont know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate	140.37123107910156
2867/3605	Oh yes but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond	280.3952941894531
2868/3605	What the mercers wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs Has he not already forgotten she ever existed Fine vengeance that on my faith   A cold sweat broke from DArtagnans	246.6788330078125
2869/3605	Why this woman was a monster He resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was	296.7956237792969
2870/3605	That will do said Milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave	215.79010009765625
2871/3605	To be sure for Monsieur de Ward	630.8524780273438
2872/3605	Now there is one said Kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor Monsieur dArtagn	50.031551361083984
2873/3605	Go to bed mademoiselle said Milady I dont like	232.14427185058594
2874/3605	DArtagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which Milady fastened herself	155.22018432617188
2875/3605	On her side but as softly as possible Kitty turned the key of the lock and then DArtagnan opened the closet	107.24047088623047
2876/3605	Oh good Lord said Kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you How pale you are   The abominable creature murmured DArtagn	55.45858383178711
2877/3605	There is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and Miladys every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the	122.81884765625
2878/3605	Thats exactly the reason I wont go said DArtagn	96.7347183227539
2879/3605	She had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much	240.56924438476562
2880/3605	It was a movement of vengeance upon Mil	342.2380065917969
2881/3605	DArtagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the	86.74689483642578
2882/3605	With a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and	221.9796142578125
2883/3605	It must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of M	206.74412536621094
2884/3605	Bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to DArtagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secretsonly she believed she could say she was not	149.64173889160156
2885/3605	As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal Kitty knew nothing about it but this time DArtagnan was better informed than she	125.67110443115234
2886/3605	As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving England he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond stud	114.99830627441406
2887/3605	But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of Milady was increased by his not having killed her brotherin	222.6572265625
2888/3605	DArtagnan came the next day to Miladys and finding her in a very illhumor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from	93.45752716064453
2889/3605	Kitty came in but Milady was very cross with	432.31427001953125
2890/3605	DArtagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to Milady he had framed a little plan in his	164.30494689941406
2891/3605	He found Kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her	99.43645477294922
2892/3605	Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely sc	12354.0068359375
2893/3605	Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes and she ordered Kitty to come at nine oclock in the morning to take a third	146.8390350341797
2894/3605	DArtagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following	77.75232696533203
2895/3605	The poor girl promised all her lover desired she was	820.09228515625
2896/3605	Things passed as on the night	204.81201171875
2897/3605	DArtagnan concealed himself in his closet Milady called undressed sent away Kitty and shut the	228.91680908203125
2898/3605	As the night before DArtagnan did not return home till five oclock in the	15.486268997192383
2899/3605	At eleven oclock Kitty came to	120.12922668457031
2900/3605	She held in her hand a fresh billet from Mil	214.93324279785156
2901/3605	This time the poor girl did not even argue with DArtagnan she gave it to him at	56.30042266845703
2902/3605	She belonged body and soul to her handsome	1244.2657470703125
2903/3605	DArtagnan opened the letter and read as follows   This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love	20.1561336517334
2904/3605	Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I detest	50.85252380371094
2905/3605	If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the     young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit     may obtain his	110.54318237304688
2906/3605	DArtagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this b	144.97227478027344
2907/3605	Oh you love her still said Kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young mans countenance for an	122.56242370605469
2908/3605	I do not love her but I will avenge myself for her	58.4921760559082
2909/3605	Oh yes I know what sort of vengeance You told me that   What matters it to you Kitty You know it is you alone whom I	85.24020385742188
2910/3605	How can I know that   By the scorn I will throw upon	103.38408660888672
2911/3605	But now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness     since not only your letter but your servant assures me that I have     the good fortune to be beloved by	82.88919830322266
2912/3605	She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit     may obtain his	103.49166107177734
2913/3605	I will come and ask mine at eleven oclock     this	49.24222183227539
2914/3605	To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh    	303.87823486328125
2915/3605	From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men     COMTE DE WARDES     This note was in the first place a forgery it was likewise an indelic	909.8563842773438
2916/3605	It was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do	315.240234375
2917/3605	Besides DArtagnan from her own admission knew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for	423.35601806640625
2918/3605	And yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veinspassion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader ple	1793.541015625
2919/3605	By Kittys chamber he could gain that of her	349.3956604003906
2920/3605	He would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over	204.8386688232422
2921/3605	He might fail but something must be left to	419.533203125
2922/3605	In eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave Paris DArtagnan had no time for a prolonged love	122.35261535644531
2923/3605	There said the young man handing Kitty the letter sealed give that to Mil	459.5804138183594
2924/3605	Poor Kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter	573.2689819335938
2925/3605	Listen my dear girl said DArtagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or	103.88270568847656
2926/3605	Milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the counts that it is I who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de Ward	215.75904846191406
2927/3605	Milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her	374.97552490234375
2928/3605	Alas said Kitty for whom have I exposed myself to all that   For me I well know my sweet girl said DArtagn	101.67829132080078
2929/3605	But I am grateful I swear to	49.34072494506836
2930/3605	But what does this note contain   Milady will tell	98.63633728027344
2931/3605	Ah you do not love me cried Kitty and I am very	104.51231384277344
2932/3605	To this reproach there is always one response which deludes	910.5894775390625
2933/3605	DArtagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great	273.4535217285156
2934/3605	Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all DArtagnan	544.1253051757812
2935/3605	Finally he promised that he would leave her mistresss presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the	127.75042724609375
2936/3605	IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF     Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between	117868.65625
2937/3605	They dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they	195.70697021484375
2938/3605	This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to find DArtagn	72.13381958007812
2939/3605	Soon as Kitty left him DArtagnan directed his steps toward the Rue Fé	56.62652587890625
2940/3605	Aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cass	113.44622802734375
2941/3605	Athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded	2354.952880859375
2942/3605	Athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free	128.09324645996094
2943/3605	He never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked	218.66415405273438
2944/3605	People in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given	154.46212768554688
2945/3605	The four countenances expressed four different feelings that of Porthos tranquillity that of DArtagnan hope that of Aramis uneasiness that of Athos care	84.47618103027344
2946/3605	At the end of a moments conversation in which Porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his embarrassment Mousqueton	265.24127197265625
2947/3605	He came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously	184.1595916748047
2948/3605	Is it my equipment   Yes and no replied Mousqu	80.9006118774414
2949/3605	Well but cant you speak   Come monsie	33.14545822143555
2950/3605	Porthos rose saluted his friends and followed Mousqu	54.2489128112793
2951/3605	An instant after Bazin made his appearance at the	65.55140686035156
2952/3605	What do you want with me my friend said Aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the	77.88591766357422
2953/3605	A man wishes to see Monsieur at home replied Baz	87.9409408569336
2954/3605	A man What man   A mendic	126.20244598388672
2955/3605	Give him alms Bazin and bid him pray for a poor s	303.539794921875
2956/3605	This mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see	73.07328796386719
2957/3605	Has he sent no particular message for me  	180.6772918701172
2958/3605	If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come he said tell him I am from	155.8863983154297
2959/3605	A thousand pardons gentlemen but no doubt this man brings me the news I	212.49090576171875
2960/3605	And rising also he went off at a quick	225.2150115966797
2961/3605	I believe these fellows have managed their	1195.044189453125
2962/3605	What do you think DArtagnan said Ath	7.434871196746826
2963/3605	I know that Porthos was in a fair way replied DArtagnan and as to Aramis to tell you the truth I have never been seriously uneasy on his	38.075523376464844
2964/3605	Go to my dear Athos you have truly inconceivable	228.0577392578125
2965/3605	Oh ay the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice which naturally you took care not to	551.4598999023438
2966/3605	Yes you look there for your outfit I think you	299.24951171875
2967/3605	I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of Madame Bonacie	137.52565002441406
2968/3605	Yes I understand now to find one woman you court	437.423583984375
2969/3605	It is the longest road but certainly the most	2188.773681640625
2970/3605	DArtagnan was on the point of telling Athos all but one consideration restrained	52.27429962158203
2971/3605	Athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this Pur	231.4642791748047
2972/3605	He was therefore silent and as Athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth DArtagnans confidence stopped	123.82368469238281
2973/3605	We will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow Aram	68.3559799194336
2974/3605	Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from Tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before Bazin he ran without stopping from the Rue Férou to the Rue de Vaugir	77.80888366699219
2975/3605	On entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with r	210.37171936035156
2976/3605	You have asked for me said the Musket	69.57855987548828
2977/3605	I wish to speak with Monsieur Aram	12.005535125732422
2978/3605	Is that your name monsieur   My very	49.398128509521484
2979/3605	You have brought me something   Yes if you show me a certain embroidered handker	71.70904541015625
2980/3605	Here it is said Aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it	141.2694854736328
2981/3605	That is right replied the mendicant dismiss your lac	307.9403381347656
2982/3605	In fact Bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to	89.01969909667969
2983/3605	At the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to	70.87833404541016
2984/3605	Perform your duty in camp I will do mine	1075.254150390625
2985/3605	Accept that which the bearer brings you make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black	724.85205078125
2986/3605	Aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript  	880.6293334960938
2987/3605	You may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of Spain     Golden dreams cried Aram	552.3694458007812
2988/3605	Bazin scratched at the door and as Aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come	66.41939544677734
2989/3605	Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce DArtagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to Aramis on leaving Ath	39.814674377441406
2990/3605	Now as DArtagnan used no ceremony with Aramis seeing that Bazin forgot to announce him he announced	115.61289978027344
2991/3605	The devil my dear Aramis said DArtagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from Tours I beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers	128.29269409179688
2992/3605	You are mistaken friend DArtagnan said Aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in onesyllable verse which I began y	307.3758239746094
2993/3605	Well your publisher is very generous my dear Aramis thats all I can	261.1856384277344
2994/3605	How monsieur cried Bazin a poem sell so dear as that It is incredible Oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benser	63.18148422241211
2995/3605	A poet is as good as an abb	43.54471969604492
2996/3605	Ah Monsieur Aramis become a poet I beg of	34.13117599487305
2997/3605	Bazin my friend said Aramis I believe you meddle with my	56.069862365722656
2998/3605	Bazin perceived he was wrong he bowed and went	87.24322509765625
2999/3605	Ah said DArtagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in	159.05447387695312
3000/3605	You are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your	196.0585479736328
3001/3605	Aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his double	772.7122192382812
3002/3605	My dear DArtagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as I am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your	53.405948638916016
3003/3605	My faith said DArtagnan with great	33.819942474365234
3004/3605	It is long since we have had a good dinner and I for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry I confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old Burg	144.2011260986328
3005/3605	Agreed as to the old Burgundy I have no objection to that said Aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of	204.70831298828125
3006/3605	And having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a tal	372.91961669921875
3007/3605	The two friends repaired to Athoss and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to	221.57469177246094
3008/3605	As he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy DArtagnan and Aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to	72.62847137451172
3009/3605	They went to find Porthos and at the corner of the Rue Bac met Mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a	85.54473876953125
3010/3605	DArtagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from	20.25690269470215
3011/3605	Aramis look at that horse   Oh the frightful brute said Aram	98.3755111694336
3012/3605	Ah my dear replied DArtagnan upon that very horse I came to	48.884857177734375
3013/3605	What does Monsieur know this horse said Mousqu	77.16554260253906
3014/3605	It is of an original color said Aramis I never saw one with such a hide in my	153.36207580566406
3015/3605	I can well believe it replied DArtagnan and that was why I got three crowns for	44.89582824707031
3016/3605	It must have been for his hide for _certes_ the carcass is not worth eighteen liv	600.4248046875
3017/3605	She had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent Spanish _genet_ and an Andalusian mule which were beautiful to look	367.26568603515625
3018/3605	The husband heard of the affair on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible	510.96954345703125
3019/3605	Which you are taking back to him said DArtagn	26.28416633605957
3020/3605	You may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to	88.17078399658203
3021/3605	No _pardieu_ though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow	45.975276947021484
3022/3605	That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in	75.2821273803711

3026/3605	He having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in	287.9242248535156
3027/3605	Meanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the Pont Neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the Rue aux O	173.8618927001953

3039/3605	There is no harm in trying to buy things cheap Monsieur Porthos said the procurators wife seeking to excuse	573.765625
3040/3605	No madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous	686.8722534179688

3064/3605	At ten oclock Milady began to appear	213.2039794921875
3065/3605	She looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at DArtagnan with an air which said You are very amiable no doubt but you would be _charming_ if you would only	211.02777099609375
3066/3605	DArtagnan rose and took his hat Milady gave him her hand to	59.19475555419922
3067/3605	The young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his	145.02322387695312
3068/3605	This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great	265.3760986328125
3069/3605	It was necessary that DArtagnan should find alone the staircase and the little	78.13719177246094
3070/3605	She heard him enter but she did not raise her	95.42249298095703
3071/3605	The young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed	114.14550018310547
3072/3605	As DArtagnan had presumed on receiving his letter Milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given Kitty a	144.26516723632812
3073/3605	Returning to her own room Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the	312.3848876953125
3074/3605	The poor girl under the caresses of DArtagnan lifted her	58.59867477416992
3075/3605	DArtagnan himself was frightened by the change in her count	48.818634033203125
3076/3605	She joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a	173.47218322753906
3077/3605	As little sensitive as was the heart of DArtagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in	246.57862854003906
3078/3605	He did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch only he represented his action as one of simple	418.8201904296875
3079/3605	For the rest this vengeance was very easy for Milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered Kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber	163.45498657226562

3081/3605	Presently they heard Milady retire to her	857.8443603515625
3082/3605	Hardly was he concealed when the little bell	856.0610961914062
3083/3605	Kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two	109.15148162841797
3084/3605	Milady seemed overcome with joy and made Kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with De Wardes when he received the letter how he had responded what was the expression of his face if he seemed very am	390.3401794433594
3085/3605	And to all these questions poor Kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egot	637.8539428710938
3086/3605	Finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached Milady had everything about her darkened and ordered Kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce De Wardes whenever he presented	500.88275146484375
3087/3605	Hardly had DArtagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when Kitty reclosed the door of	177.13426208496094
3088/3605	It is I said DArtagnan in a subdued voice I the Comte de Ward	146.802490234375
3089/3605	Oh my God my God murmured Kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named   Well said Milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter Count Count added she you know that I wait for	121.99655151367188
3090/3605	At this appeal DArtagnan drew Kitty quietly away and slipped into the	235.99180603027344

3092/3605	DArtagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not fore	74.84827423095703
3093/3605	Jealousy gnawed his heart and he suffered almost as much as poor Kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next	230.1014862060547
3094/3605	Yes Count said Milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own I am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have	125.01622009277344
3095/3605	Oh tomorrow tomorrow I must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto DArtagn	132.6334686279297
3096/3605	DArtagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with brill	57.63313293457031
3097/3605	The first movement of DArtagnan was to return it but Milady added No no Keep that ring for love of	157.43234252929688
3098/3605	Besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you	177.61585998535156
3099/3605	This woman is full of mysteries murmured DArtagnan to	43.67262649536133
3100/3605	At that instant he felt himself ready to reveal	177.1289520263672
3101/3605	He even opened his mouth to tell Milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added Poor angel whom that monster of a Gascon barely failed to	396.5005798339844
3102/3605	Oh continued Milady do your wounds still make you suffer   Yes much said DArtagnan who did not well know how to	64.59941101074219

3104/3605	It took some time for DArtagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely	90.68075561523438

3106/3605	He would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabol	278.0596923828125
3107/3605	DArtagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following	432.0323791503906
3108/3605	Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to DArtagnan when he passed through her chamber but Milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the	91.10541534423828
3109/3605	The next morning DArtagnan ran to find Ath	35.52657699584961
3110/3605	He was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for	124.09587097167969
3111/3605	Your Milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive	95.2871322631836
3112/3605	In one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your	218.69345092773438
3113/3605	While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on DArtagnans finger the place of the queens ring carefully kept in a c	135.60182189941406
3114/3605	You notice my ring said the Gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his	151.70175170898438
3115/3605	Yes said Athos it reminds me of a family	163.28904724121094
3116/3605	It is beautiful is it not said DArtagn	26.08491325378418
3117/3605	I did not think two sapphires of such a fine water	277.1352233886719
3118/3605	Have you traded it for your diamond  	682.7568359375
3119/3605	It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman or rather Frenchwomanfor I am convinced she was born in France though I have not questioned	319.6530456542969
3120/3605	That ring comes from Milady cried Athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong	165.81381225585938
3121/3605	Her very self she gave it me last	854.7305908203125
3122/3605	Here it is replied DArtagnan taking it from his	28.98611068725586
3123/3605	Athos examined it and became very	290.54034423828125
3124/3605	He tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for	193.7692108154297
3125/3605	A shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this	386.2566223144531
3126/3605	It is impossible it can be she said	124.8831787109375
3127/3605	How could this ring come into the hands of Milady Clarik And yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two	609.2055053710938
3128/3605	Do you know this ring said DArtagn	23.4949893951416
3129/3605	I thought I did replied Athos but no doubt I was	52.00132369995117
3130/3605	And he returned DArtagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at	128.7096710205078
3131/3605	Pray DArtagnan said Athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that I shall have no head to converse with	246.1952667236328
3132/3605	Dont ask me for counsel dont tell me you are perplexed what to	268.2569274902344

3134/3605	DArtagnan took off the ring giving it again to Ath	46.494075775146484
3135/3605	Look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to DArtagnan the scratch he had	115.84013366699219
3136/3605	But from whom did this ring come to you Athos   From my mother who inherited it from her	131.00881958007812
3137/3605	As I told you it is an old family	105.94444274902344
3138/3605	No replied Athos with a singular	23.008134841918945
3139/3605	I gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to	41.40640640258789

3143/3605	I do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about	162.64956665039062
3144/3605	You are right said DArtagnan I will have done with	16.44072914123535

3147/3605	On reaching home DArtagnan found Kitty waiting for	145.01885986328125
3148/3605	A month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and	434.3603515625

3158/3605	DArtagnan gave the open letter to Kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second	127.6133804321289
3159/3605	She could scarcely believe in her happiness and DArtagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had	84.03612518310547

3180/3605	He opened it and read as follows   DEAR	749.012939453125
3181/3605	DARTAGNAN It is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a	1637.868896484375
3182/3605	My brotherinlaw and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in	111.33094787597656
3183/3605	Will it be the same this evening     Your very grateful MILADY CLARIK     Thats all very simple said DArtagnan I expected this	984.6336669921875
3184/3605	My credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Ward	633.96484375
3185/3605	Listen to me my dear girl said the Gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive	161.74668884277344
3186/3605	You are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than	86.160400390625
3187/3605	Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to	1228.098876953125
3188/3605	DArtagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Mil	137.81588745117188
3189/3605	He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her	145.8138427734375
3190/3605	He did not dare to write for fear of not being ableto such experienced eyes as those of Miladyto disguise his writing	377.03167724609375
3191/3605	As nine oclock sounded DArtagnan was at the Place	27.480777740478516
3192/3605	It was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as DArtagnan appeared before even he had asked if Milady were visible one of them ran to announce	73.94530487060547
3193/3605	Show him in said Milady in a quick tone but so piercing that DArtagnan heard her in the antech	95.49923706054688
3194/3605	I am at home to nobody said Milady observe to _nobody	2674.957763671875
3195/3605	DArtagnan cast an inquiring glance at Mil	25.963289260864258
3196/3605	She was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of	281.93511962890625
3197/3605	The number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two	197.50967407226562
3198/3605	DArtagnan approached her with his usual gall	31.3559513092041
3199/3605	She then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable	258.7058410644531
3200/3605	To the questions which DArtagnan put concerning her health she replied Bad very	377.9705810546875
3201/3605	Then replied he my visit is illtimed you no doubt stand in need of repose and I will	398.65704345703125
3202/3605	On the contrary stay Monsieur dArtagnan your agreeable company will divert	157.1737060546875
3203/3605	She has never been so kind	107.88780212402344
3204/3605	On guard   Milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brillian	154.69769287109375
3205/3605	At the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her	402.250732421875
3206/3605	DArtagnan was again in the presence of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her enchant	140.45948791503906
3207/3605	His love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his	251.7351531982422
3208/3605	Milady smiled and DArtagnan felt that he could damn himself for that	117.18534088134766
3209/3605	There was a moment at which he felt something like	106.87239837646484
3210/3605	She asked DArtagnan if he had a	26.776391983032227
3211/3605	Have I any need to tell you so Have you not perceived it   It may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be	136.33932495117188
3212/3605	Oh difficulties do not affright me said DArtagn	49.25886917114258
3213/3605	Nothing is impossible replied Milady to true	884.9541625976562
3214/3605	Nothing madame   Nothing replied Mil	47.25688552856445
3215/3605	Well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you	63.12138366699219
3216/3605	All that could be required of	193.75730895996094
3217/3605	For everything   For everything cried DArtagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself	63.66722106933594
3218/3605	Well now let us talk a little seriously said Milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to DArtagnans	104.4925765991211
3219/3605	I am all attention madame said	126.16001892089844
3220/3605	Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said I have an	250.86553955078125
3221/3605	You madame said DArtagnan affecting surprise is that possible my Godgood and beautiful as you are   A mortal	110.78095245361328
3222/3605	Indeed   An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the	97.69347381591797
3223/3605	May I reckon on you as an auxiliary   DArtagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to	229.4425811767578
3224/3605	You may madame said he with	169.3953094482422
3225/3605	My arm and my life belong to you like my	170.25448608398438
3226/3605	Then said Milady since you are as generous as you are loving   She	133.4738006591797
3227/3605	Well replied Milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of imposs	133.35165405273438
3228/3605	Do not overwhelm me with happiness cried DArtagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to	103.76536560058594
3229/3605	You have understood me then dear Monsieur dArtagnan said Mil	30.26801872253418
3230/3605	I could interpret one of your	605.1129150390625
3231/3605	Then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown   Instantly   But on my part said Milady how should I repay such a service I know these	175.1847381591797
3232/3605	They are men who do nothing for	294.7258605957031
3233/3605	You know the only reply that I desire said DArtagnan the only one worthy of you and of me   And he drew nearer to	48.6273307800293
3234/3605	Well merit this pretended happiness then   I am at your orders said DArtagn	39.619544982910156
3235/3605	Quite certain said Milady with a last	674.9447631835938
3236/3605	Only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes   Who told you that I had been weeping said	102.21784210205078
3237/3605	It appeared to me   Such women as I never weep said Mil	183.49542236328125
3238/3605	So much the better Come tell me his name   Remember that his name is all my	65.7474594116211
3239/3605	Yes you must see what confidence I have in you   You overwhelm me with	56.39564895629883
3240/3605	What is his name   You know	17.835391998291016
3241/3605	It is surely not one of my friends replied DArtagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him	117.28562927246094
3242/3605	If it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried Milady and a threatening glance darted from her	221.91505432128906
3243/3605	Not if it were my own brother cried DArtagnan as if carried away by his	62.389862060546875
3244/3605	Our Gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was	158.0766143798828
3245/3605	Alas do you love nothing else in me asked DArtagn	50.08222961425781
3246/3605	I love you also _you_ said she taking his	140.99269104003906
3247/3605	The warm pressure made DArtagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed Milady attacked	254.52394104003906
3248/3605	Oh if that were so I should lose my reason   And he folded her in his	76.13409423828125
3249/3605	She made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to	207.7736358642578
3250/3605	Her lips were cold it appeared to DArtagnan that he had embraced a	91.75116729736328
3251/3605	He was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by	809.6869506835938
3252/3605	He almost believed in the tenderness of Milady he almost believed in the crime of De Ward	336.3885192871094
3253/3605	If De Wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed	336.8071594238281
3254/3605	His name is said she in her	100.32975769042969
3255/3605	De Wardes I know it cried DArtagn	83.2925033569336
3256/3605	And how do you know it asked Milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his	56.01353073120117
3257/3605	DArtagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an	29.808937072753906
3258/3605	Tell me tell me tell me I say repeated Milady how do you know it   How do I know it said DArtagn	34.402076721191406
3259/3605	I know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes in a saloon where I was showed a ring which he said he had received from	277.8934631347656
3260/3605	The epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of DArtagnans	110.79563903808594
3261/3605	Well I will avenge you of this wretch replied DArtagnan giving himself the airs of Don Japhet of	282.19049072265625
3262/3605	Thanks my brave friend cried Milady and when shall I be avenged   Tomorrowimmediatelywhen you please   Milady was about to cry out Immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward DArtagn	254.38644409179688
3263/3605	Besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before	467.4090881347656
3264/3605	All this was answered by an expression of DArtagn	39.57783126831055
3265/3605	Tomorrow said he you will be avenged or I shall be	49.44413375854492
3266/3605	No said she you will avenge me but you will not be	36.13062286376953
3267/3605	With women perhaps but not with	876.638671875
3268/3605	But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with	88.52642822265625
3269/3605	Fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back	4964.28271484375
3270/3605	And then accompanying the glance with explanatory words That is but too just said she tender	1790.17041015625
3271/3605	Oh you are an angel exclaimed the young	59.71697235107422
3272/3605	Except that which I ask of you dear	214.163818359375
3273/3605	But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness   I cannot wait till	26.179489135742188
3274/3605	It will be useless for him to find you	44.87483215332031
3275/3605	She rang the bell and Kitty	416.6708679199219
3276/3605	Go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven oclock we will then terminate this	186.5210723876953
3277/3605	Kitty will conduct you to my	294.245361328125
3278/3605	The poor girl almost fainted at hearing these	156.21083068847656
3279/3605	Well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue Do as I bid you show the chevalier out and this evening at eleven oclockyou have heard what I	115.48529052734375
3280/3605	It appears that these appointments are all made for eleven oclock thought DArtagnan thats a settled	130.91221618652344
3281/3605	Milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tender	149.6902618408203
3282/3605	But said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of Kitty I must not play the	163.0872039794922
3283/3605	This woman is certainly a great	1354.0250244140625
3284/3605	What was most clear in the matter was that DArtagnan loved Milady like a madman and that she did not love him at	57.17555236816406
3285/3605	But he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of	248.57122802734375
3286/3605	He wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce	59.89212417602539
3287/3605	He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in Miladys apartment which was to be seen through the blind	141.46995544433594
3288/3605	It was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the	37.872928619384766
3289/3605	With this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of DArtagn	233.06265258789062
3290/3605	He recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he reentered the hôtel and flew toward Kittys	207.351318359375
3291/3605	The poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but Milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise DArtagnan had made and opening the door said Come	136.4735870361328
3292/3605	All this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that DArtagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he	257.7630310058594
3293/3605	He imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in	365.6910095214844
3294/3605	He however darted not the less quickly toward Milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over	3684.30712890625
3295/3605	As the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward	344.5862121582031
3296/3605	This last thought of love counseled her to make this last	335.3298034667969
3297/3605	DArtagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his	36.02246856689453
3298/3605	It was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently	219.46002197265625
3299/3605	A secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but selflove but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murm	183.92930603027344
3300/3605	And then our Gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with De Wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself   He was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the	313.4581604003906
3301/3605	Milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to	483.01190185546875
3302/3605	But DArtagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrust	245.95541381835938
3303/3605	This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady whose questions became more	805.4591674804688
3304/3605	Then DArtagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not	74.87701416015625
3305/3605	Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron	689.0679321289062
3306/3605	DArtagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to renounce by pardoning De Wardes the furious projects she had	1050.053955078125
3307/3605	He shall die then since you condemn him said DArtagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of	103.42950439453125
3308/3605	We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady but DArtagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its pal	105.48908233642578
3309/3605	Seeing DArtagnan about to leave her Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Ward	168.23060607910156
3310/3605	I am quite ready said DArtagnan but in the first place I should like to be certain of one	15.581037521362305
3311/3605	That is whether you really love me   I have given you proof of that it seems to	27.72333526611328
3312/3605	And I am yours body and soul   Thanks my brave lover but as you are satisfied of my love you must in your turn satisfy me of	151.7882080078125
3313/3605	Is it not so   Certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied DArtagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account   What have I to fear   Why that I may be dangerously woundedkilled	46.249114990234375
3314/3605	Impossible cried Milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swords	427.18804931640625
3315/3605	You would not then prefer a method resumed DArtagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless   Milady looked at her lover in	199.75888061523438
3316/3605	The pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful	246.47459411621094
3317/3605	Really said she I believe you now begin to	116.13825225830078
3318/3605	No I do not hesitate but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes since you have ceased to love	215.6143341064453
3319/3605	I think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastis	178.72019958496094
3320/3605	Who told you that I loved him asked Milady	198.0315704345703
3321/3605	At least I am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and I repeat that I am really interested for the	129.94635009765625
3322/3605	And why _you_   Because I alone know   What   That he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he	97.24696350097656
3323/3605	Indeed said Milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for I really cannot tell what you	227.57638549804688
3324/3605	And she looked at DArtagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves	43.15525436401367
3325/3605	Yes I am a man of honor said DArtagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and I am satisfied I possess itfor I do possess it do I not   Entirely go	48.166595458984375
3326/3605	Well I feel as if transformeda confession weighs on my	878.9319458007812
3327/3605	A confession   If I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not   Without	57.54909896850586
3328/3605	Then if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me  	151.382568359375
3329/3605	DArtagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Miladys but she evaded	108.52600860595703
3330/3605	Do not lie my angel said DArtagnan smiling that would be	97.03218078613281
3331/3605	What do you mean Speak you kill	98.62223052978516
3332/3605	Be satisfied you are not guilty toward me and I have already pardoned	67.16154479980469
3333/3605	What next what next   De Wardes cannot boast of	2040.992431640625
3334/3605	How is that You told me yourself that that ring   That ring I have The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the DArtagnan of today are the same	280.1031799316406
3335/3605	The imprudent young man expected a surprise mixed with shamea slight storm which would resolve itself into tears but he was strangely deceived and his error was not of long	284.01116943359375
3336/3605	Pale and trembling Milady repulsed DArtagnans attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of	176.11981201171875
3337/3605	DArtagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen to implore her pardon but she with a strong movement tried to	337.57537841796875
3338/3605	Great God cried DArtagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and	235.30862426757812
3339/3605	But Milady felt herself denounced even by his	783.1112670898438
3340/3605	The young man now knew her secret her terrible secretthe secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except	811.2021484375
3341/3605	She turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded pant	270.8078308105469
3342/3605	Ah wretch cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret You shall	318.5810546875
3343/3605	Although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding	419.3701477050781
3344/3605	He recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabb	100.46226501464844
3345/3605	But without taking any heed of the sword Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her	166.99569702148438
3346/3605	Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable	399.6844787597656
3347/3605	As all this however bore some resemblance to a duel DArtagnan began to recover himself little by	186.9920654296875
3348/3605	Well beautiful lady very well said he but _pardieu_ if you dont calm yourself I will design a second _fleurdelis_ upon one of those pretty cheeks   Scoundrel infamous scoundrel howled Mil	400.4454345703125
3349/3605	But DArtagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to Kittys	415.6774597167969
3350/3605	At the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach Kitty opened the	526.8594970703125
3351/3605	DArtagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from	228.84271240234375
3352/3605	With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while Kitty pushed the	346.1649169921875
3353/3605	Then Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the	238.6798095703125
3354/3605	Every blow was accompanied with terrible imprec	444.9389953613281
3355/3605	Quick Kitty quick said DArtagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel for if we leave her time to turn round she will have me killed by the	96.19791412353516
3356/3605	But you cant go out so said Kitty you are	467.8173522949219
3357/3605	Thats true said DArtagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in thats	165.2581329345703
3358/3605	But dress me as well as you are able only make haste think my dear girl its life and death   Kitty was but too well aware of	191.6692352294922
3359/3605	In a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a	812.2670288085938
3360/3605	She gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the	86.21324920654297
3361/3605	Milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hô	460.48175048828125
3362/3605	The porter was drawing the cord at the moment Milady cried from her window Dont open   The young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent	219.71267700195312
3363/3605	The moment she lost sight of him Milady tumbled fainting into her	216.16653442382812
3364/3605	The confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his	222.5381317138672
3365/3605	He crossed the court ran up the two flights to Athoss apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it	144.57421875
3366/3605	Grimaud came rubbing his halfopen eyes to answer this noisy summons and DArtagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lac	295.6813659667969
3367/3605	In spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his	262.82061767578125
3368/3605	Holloa there cried he what do you want you strumpet Whats your business here you hussy   DArtagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the	371.647705078125
3369/3605	At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a	361.52276611328125
3370/3605	He then concluded it must be an	99.86058044433594
3371/3605	Hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man I am DArtagnan dont you know me Where is your master   You Monsieur dArtagnan cried Grimaud	35.78061294555664
3372/3605	Athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyespetticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with	617.9067993164062
3373/3605	Come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be	104.79720306396484
3374/3605	Well but put on this dressing gown first said the Musketeer to his	299.8468322753906
3375/3605	DArtagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still	275.8902587890625

3377/3605	Are you _sure_ that the _other_ is dead   _The other_ said Athos in so stifled a voice that DArtagnan scarcely heard	77.92168426513672
3378/3605	Yes she of whom you told me one day at Am	145.9259033203125
3379/3605	Athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his	86.91627502441406
3380/3605	This is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight	65.85344696044922
3381/3605	Fair said Athos is she not  	33.34455871582031
3382/3605	Blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows  	149.83580017089844
3383/3605	Tall wellmade She has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left  	1096.314208984375
3384/3605	The _fleurdelis_ is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices  	630.8978271484375
3385/3605	But you say she is English   She is called Milady but she may be	107.27400970458984
3386/3605	Lord de Winter is only her brotherin	65.22908782958984
3387/3605	I will see her DArtagnan   Beware Athos	79.17384338378906
3388/3605	You tried to kill her she is a woman to return you the like and not to	142.77688598632812
3389/3605	She will not dare to say anything that would be to denounce	85.07659912109375
3390/3605	She is capable of anything or	407.2984924316406
3391/3605	Did you ever see her furious   No said Ath	54.786495208740234
3392/3605	A tigress a panther Ah my dear Athos I am greatly afraid I have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us   DArtagnan then related allthe mad passion of Milady and her menaces of	196.0262908935547
3393/3605	You are right and upon my soul I would give my life for a hair said Ath	58.83094024658203
3394/3605	Fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave	103.76130676269531
3395/3605	We are going according to all probability to La Rochelle and once gone   She will follow you to the end of the world Athos if she recognizes	88.26371002197266
3396/3605	Let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone   My dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said Ath	181.10382080078125
3397/3605	Do you perchance think I set any great store by life   There is something horribly mysterious under all this Athos this woman is one of the cardinals spies I am sure of	202.54627990722656

3399/3605	Mistrust everything in short even your own	1097.5350341796875
3400/3605	Fortunately said DArtagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have I hope only men to	105.41195678710938
3401/3605	In the meantime said Athos I renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go I will go with	95.50879669189453
3402/3605	You must return to the Rue des Fossoyeurs I will accompany	63.721099853515625
3403/3605	But however near it may be replied DArtagnan I cannot go thither in this	66.72598266601562
3404/3605	Thats true said Athos and he rang the	118.5079574584961
3405/3605	Athos made him a sign to go to DArtagnans residence and bring back some	93.63880920410156
3406/3605	Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set	329.5158996582031
3407/3605	All this will not advance your outfit said Athos for if I am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with Milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to	124.60872650146484
3408/3605	The jewel is yours my dear Athos Did you not tell me it was a family jewel   Yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told	75.41075134277344
3409/3605	It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is	159.9673614501953
3410/3605	My mother gave it to me and I fool as I was instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic gave it to this w	164.18223571777344
3411/3605	Then my friend take back this ring to which I see you attach much	194.55348205566406
3412/3605	I take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature Never that ring is defiled DArtagn	258.4176025390625
3413/3605	Sell a jewel which came from my mother I vow I should consider it a profan	319.86529541015625
3414/3605	Pledge it then you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on	166.46937561035156
3415/3605	With that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of us	374.5830993652344
3416/3605	You are a capital companion DArtagnan said he your neverfailing cheerfulness raises poor souls in aff	863.2987060546875
3417/3605	Well let us pledge the ring but upon one	312.0052490234375
3418/3605	What   That there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for	32.11368179321289
3419/3605	I dont need the quarter of such a sumI who am still only in the Guardsand by selling my saddles I shall procure	348.7677917480469
3420/3605	What do I want A horse for Planchet thats	136.72532653808594
3421/3605	Besides you forget that I have a ring	226.1307830810547
3422/3605	To which you attach more value it seems than I do to mine at least I have thought	133.57037353515625
3423/3605	Yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great	188.8391876220703
3424/3605	It is not only a valuable diamond but it is an enchanted tal	2682.832763671875
3425/3605	I dont at all understand you but I believe all you say to be	132.85816955566406
3426/3605	Let us return to my ring or rather to	227.636962890625
3427/3605	You shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or I will throw it into the Seine and I doubt as was the case with Polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to	211.2681121826172
3428/3605	Well I will take it then said DArtagn	14.224403381347656
3429/3605	At this moment Grimaud returned accompanied by Planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments	103.99402618408203
3430/3605	DArtagnan dressed himself and Athos did the	28.68971061706543
3431/3605	When the two were ready to go out the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his	117.88044738769531
3432/3605	They arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoye	148.57679748535156
3433/3605	Bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at DArtagnan hate	23.71146011352539
3434/3605	Make haste dear lodger said he there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs and you know women dont like to be kept	298.48565673828125
3435/3605	Thats Kitty said DArtagnan to himself and darted into the	58.22014617919922
3436/3605	Sure enough Upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a trem	108.09939575195312
3437/3605	As soon as she perceived him she cried You have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her	175.9764404296875
3438/3605	Remember it is you who have ruined me   Yes yes to be sure Kitty said DArtagnan be at ease my	62.110809326171875
3439/3605	But what happened after my departure   How can I tell said	200.8612060546875
3440/3605	The lackeys were brought by the cries she	144.63441467285156
3441/3605	There exist no imprecations she did not pour out against	281.6676940917969
3442/3605	Then I thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose I was your accomplice so I took what little money I had and the best of my things and I got	182.2176971435547
3443/3605	Poor dear girl But what can I do with you I am going away the day after	54.88331985473633
3444/3605	Help me out of Paris help me out of France   I cannot take you however to the siege of La Rochelle said DArtagn	45.883724212646484
3445/3605	No but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for	161.56576538085938
3446/3605	My dear little love In my country the ladies do without chambermaid	2067.81103515625
3447/3605	But stop I can manage your business for	198.26475524902344
3448/3605	We have something very important to say to	37.50470733642578
3449/3605	I understand said Athos but why not Porthos I should have thought that his duchess   Oh Porthoss duchess is dressed by her husbands clerks said DArtagnan	38.01847839355469
3450/3605	Besides Kitty would not like to live in the Rue aux O	289.849853515625
3451/3605	Isnt it so Kitty   I do not care where I live said Kitty provided I am well concealed and nobody knows where I	231.94146728515625
3452/3605	Meanwhile Kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me   Monsieur Chevalier far off or near said Kitty I shall always love	86.30245971679688
3453/3605	Where the devil will constancy niche itself next murmured Ath	1980.9530029296875

3456/3605	I attach great importance to the question I am about to put to	53.21308898925781
3457/3605	I cried Athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an add	107.38947296142578
3458/3605	You to be sure said DArtagnan pressing Athoss	32.650306701660156
3459/3605	You know the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacie	229.6290740966797
3460/3605	Besides Kitty will tell nothing will you Kitty You understand my dear girl continued DArtagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came	192.36180114746094

3465/3605	And do you believe he knew you again Kitty   I pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him but perhaps it was too	140.2428436279297
3466/3605	Go down Athoshe mistrusts you less than meand see if he be still at his	455.0099792480469
3467/3605	He has gone said he and the house door is	174.72549438476562
3468/3605	He has gone to make his report and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dove	704.7964477539062
3469/3605	Well then let us all fly said Athos and leave nobody here but Planchet to bring us	130.037841796875
3470/3605	Aramis whom we have sent for   Thats true said Athos we must wait for Aram	26.90506362915039
3471/3605	The matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for	140.43772888183594
3472/3605	Aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring Will it be really rendering you a service DArtagnan   I shall be grateful to you all my	75.59915924072266
3473/3605	Madame de BoisTracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces I believe for a trustworthy	2217.91064453125
3474/3605	If you can my dear DArtagnan answer for Mademoiselle   Oh monsieur be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting	20.333049774169922
3475/3605	Then said Aramis this falls out very	227.3085174560547
3476/3605	He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to	126.8514404296875
3477/3605	And now my dear girl said DArtagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be	29.98099708557129

3481/3605	An instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four oclock with Athos and leaving Planchet to guard the	110.41500854492188
3482/3605	Aramis returned home and Athos and DArtagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapp	212.872314453125
3483/3605	As the Gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the	91.18629455566406
3484/3605	Still further the Jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for	113.15692138671875
3485/3605	Athos and DArtagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musket	74.34712219238281
3486/3605	Besides Athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers	117.52091979980469
3487/3605	When a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abat	854.2208862304688

3493/3605	But when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased Athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pist	115.66175079345703
3494/3605	DArtagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when	96.40391540527344
3495/3605	But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his	66.90692138671875
3496/3605	How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said Ath	166.53106689453125
3497/3605	That is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for	40.685707092285156
3498/3605	Well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the Jews	111.02527618408203
3499/3605	What will you   This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the	137.37673950195312
3500/3605	Go and tell him the ring is his DArtagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with	47.8829345703125
3501/3605	Reflect Athos   Ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make	214.7032928466797
3502/3605	Go DArtagnan go Grimaud will accompany you with his musket	96.09722900390625
3503/3605	A half hour afterward DArtagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any	53.88131332397461
3504/3605	It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not	253.7532196044922
3505/3605	A VISION     At four oclock the four friends were all assembled with Ath	109.36210632324219
3506/3605	Their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquietfor behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the	498.2286376953125
3507/3605	Suddenly Planchet entered bringing two letters for DArtagn	43.703697204589844
3508/3605	The one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green	2625.198974609375
3509/3605	The other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his Eminence the cardinal d	144.0098876953125
3510/3605	At the sight of the little letter the heart of DArtagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his	67.78742980957031
3511/3605	He therefore seized the little epistle and opened it	222.8338623046875
3512/3605	Thats a snare said Athos dont go DArtagn	56.800086975097656
3513/3605	And yet replied DArtagnan I think I recognize the	35.86430358886719
3514/3605	Between six and seven oclock the road of Chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of Bond	713.9873046875
3515/3605	But suppose we all go said DArtagnan what the devil They wont devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all   And besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said Porth	138.417236328125
3516/3605	But if it is a woman who writes said Aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her DArtagnan which is not the part of a	114.99765014648438
3517/3605	We will remain in the background said Porthos and he will advance	64.40997314453125
3518/3605	Yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gall	205.73269653320312
3519/3605	Bah said DArtagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in	82.94380950927734
3520/3605	Besides we must try our own	297.6268005371094
3521/3605	Bah let us enjoy that pleasure said Aramis with his mild and careless	185.88731384277344
3522/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by	147.02700805664062
3523/3605	Besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said Porthos and that will be a	74.43810272216797
3524/3605	But this second letter said Athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be	184.1711883544922
3525/3605	For my part I declare DArtagnan I think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bos	127.15927124023438
3526/3605	Well said he let us see gentlemen what are his Eminences commands and DArtagnan unsealed the letter and read  	57.484649658203125

3531/3605	Hum I would not go at all said Aram	43.36094284057617

3533/3605	I am of Aramiss opinion said Porth	61.63701248168945

3535/3605	I neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meConstance	864.7361450195312

3548/3605	Well my dear Aramis you dont want three horses I cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three   Therefore I only purchased two said Aram	189.97933959960938
3549/3605	The third then fell from the clouds I suppose   No the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his	106.7569351196289
3550/3605	That makes no difference said Aramis coloring and who affirmed as I said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it	418.9450378417969
3551/3605	It is only to poets that such things happen said Athos grave	291.6457824707031
3552/3605	Well in that case we can manage famously said DArtagnan which of the two horses will you ridethat which you bought or the one that was given to you   That which was given to me assured	123.46197509765625
3553/3605	You cannot for a moment imagine DArtagnan that I would commit such an offense toward   The unknown giver interrupted DArtagn	130.7725830078125

3583/3605	At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of	719.6146240234375

3585/3605	DArtagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was	118.04525756835938
3586/3605	At length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of Sèv	121.39496612548828
3587/3605	A presentiment instantly told DArtagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so	77.19781494140625
3588/3605	Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a	367.32281494140625

3597/3605	If that be the case said DArtagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to	191.7805938720703
