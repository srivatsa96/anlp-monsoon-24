71/3605	As we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with	61.15376281738281
72/3605	He was Des Roches le Masle canon of Notre Dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his Eminence as a perfectly devout	600.7019653320312
73/3605	The cardinal trusted him and therein found his	2690.486083984375
74/3605	There are many stories related of him and among them	402.898193359375
75/3605	After a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to expiate at least for some time the follies of	375.72174072265625
76/3605	On entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with	269.158203125
77/3605	At the denunciating sound the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother and all the community would go to	4601.31005859375
78/3605	This advice appeared good to the future	2104.60400390625

81/3605	In proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent	530.1185913085938

84/3605	It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible _possessed_ that ever	87.55925750732422

89/3605	For forms sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that	139.0093536376953
90/3605	When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experienceit became necessary I say to come to the conclusion of the affair that is to say to search the queen	311.3036804199219
91/3605	The chancellor advanced therefore toward Anne of Austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air And now it remains for me to make the principal	199.76060485839844
92/3605	What is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to	49.666866302490234
93/3605	His majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day he knows that it has not yet been sent to its	64.38227081298828

100/3605	Then give me that letter madame said the	103.75769805908203
101/3605	I will give it to none but the king monsieur said	29.294523239135742
102/3605	If the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you	68.23028564453125
103/3605	But I repeat to you I am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up   Well   He has then charged me to take it from	37.823028564453125

105/3605	Be kind enough then madame to act more compliant	1459.7706298828125

107/3605	I will not suffer it No no I would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to	116.53288269042969
108/3605	The queen was as we have said of great	78.49974060058594
109/3605	The commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of Buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone	289.6620788574219
110/3605	Without doubt the chancellor Séguier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell but not finding it he summoned his resolution and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be	113.6538314819336
111/3605	There monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious	77.83891296386719
112/3605	The chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and	161.56300354003906
113/3605	The door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her	55.780494689941406
114/3605	The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of	72.78548431396484
115/3605	The king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of Spain he read it	130.551025390625
116/3605	It was nothing but a plan of attack against the	146.81649780273438
117/3605	The king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the Louvre he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty in the business	168.78445434570312
118/3605	There Duke said he you were right and I was	67.76109313964844
119/3605	The whole intrigue is political and there is not the least question of love in this letter but on the other hand there is abundant question of	262.7827453613281
120/3605	The cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention then when he had arrived at the end of it he read it a second	20.914709091186523
121/3605	Well your Majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss	740.054443359375
122/3605	In your place in truth sire I should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public	135.70706176757812
123/3605	What say you Duke   I say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these neverending lab	635.0337524414062
124/3605	You would be the happier for it at home sire and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it	125.0553970336914
125/3605	Monsieur Duke said the king I understand	59.658485412597656
126/3605	Be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen	275.91973876953125
127/3605	That is true Monsieur Cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my	124.05795288085938
128/3605	It is you sire who have now incurred	379.42205810546875
129/3605	The queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable	73.50709533691406
130/3605	Allow me then sire to intercede for her with your	194.02357482910156
131/3605	Let her humble herself then and come to me	571.6320190429688
132/3605	On the contrary sire set the	184.84625244140625
133/3605	You have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the	180.81234741210938
134/3605	What I make the first advances said the	50.292930603027344
135/3605	Never   Sire I entreat you to do	14.868157386779785
136/3605	Besides in what manner can I make advances first   By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to	149.7577362060547
137/3605	What is that   Give a ball you know how much the queen loves	210.80722045898438
138/3605	I will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an	220.99160766601562
139/3605	Monsieur Cardinal you know that I do not like worldly	167.98956298828125
140/3605	Sire said the cardinal leave severity to your	749.7101440429688
141/3605	Clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage	695.8914184570312
142/3605	Thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the	163.8173370361328
143/3605	Anne of Austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with	352.8141784667969
144/3605	Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to	377.96771240234375
145/3605	The king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fê	134.9411163330078
146/3605	A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her count	106.24337005615234
147/3605	She asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that	173.03533935546875
148/3605	Indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing	198.77194213867188
149/3605	On the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these lines I have them but I am unable to leave London for want of	99.00047302246094
150/3605	Send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after I have received them I shall be in	25.197118759155273
151/3605	On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to	96.17323303222656
152/3605	Richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself She will arrive she says four or five days after having received the	151.064208984375
153/3605	It will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return that makes ten	95.5296630859375
154/3605	Now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a womans weakness there are twelve	3053.39013671875
155/3605	Well Monsieur Duke said the king have you made your calculations   Yes s	49.79330825805664
156/3605	The aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of	499.5751037597656
157/3605	That will fall in wonderfully well you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the	161.392822265625
158/3605	Then the cardinal added _A propos_ sire do not forget to tell her Majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become	274.1811828613281
159/3605	BONACIEUX AT HOME     It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the	2117.392822265625
160/3605	was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some	1034.611328125
161/3605	More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own	189.15487670898438
162/3605	He went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded	147.5657958984375
163/3605	Anne of Austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself but this was not what Louis	322.87109375
164/3605	wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was so skillful in getting	304.46551513671875
165/3605	He arrived at this end by his persistence in	1373.613525390625
166/3605	But cried Anne of Austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your	98.28543853759766
167/3605	What have I done then Let me know what crime I have	70.40007019042969
168/3605	It is impossible that your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my	493.6532287597656
169/3605	The king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fê	84.60941314697266
170/3605	Madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the Hôtel de V	36.93246078491211
171/3605	I wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which I gave you on your	461.2541809082031
172/3605	Anne of Austria believed that Louis	588.5255126953125
173/3605	knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was	266.6827087402344
174/3605	She became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a _console_ which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syll	250.03221130371094
175/3605	You hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the	168.36944580078125
176/3605	You hear madame   Yes sire I hear stammered the	44.23429870605469
177/3605	You will appear at this ball  	62.55951690673828
178/3605	The queens paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his	226.22406005859375
179/3605	Then that is agreed said the king and that is all I had to say to	37.09938049316406
180/3605	But on what day will this ball take place asked Anne of	106.01216125488281
181/3605	felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying	98.23136901855469
182/3605	Oh very shortly madame said he but I do not precisely recollect the date of the	64.21238708496094
183/3605	Then you will appear   Yes s	41.94401550292969
184/3605	That is well said the king retiring that is well I count upon	137.95480346679688
185/3605	The queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under	1396.805908203125
186/3605	I am lost murmured the queen lostfor the cardinal knows all and it is he who urges on the king who as yet knows nothing but will soon know	149.23414611816406
187/3605	I am lost My God my God my God   She knelt upon a cushion and prayed with her head buried between her palpitating	88.97315216064453
188/3605	More closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed	184.20420837402344
189/3605	Laporte could not leave the Louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could conf	69.22016906738281
190/3605	Thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and	302.66827392578125
191/3605	Can I be of service to your Majesty said all at once a voice full of sweetness and	379.4808654785156
192/3605	The queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke	167.57241821289062
193/3605	In fact at one of the doors which opened into the queens apartment appeared the pretty M	336.6725769042969
194/3605	She had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard	113.77175903320312
195/3605	The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprisedfor in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laport	78.95980072021484
196/3605	You oh heaven you cried the queen but look me in the	307.6413879394531
197/3605	Can I trust in you   Oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul I am ready to die for your Majesty   This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking	51.48734664916992
198/3605	Bonacieux yes there are traitors here but by the holy name of the Virgin I swear that no one is more devoted to your Majesty than I	109.24958038330078
199/3605	Bonacieux we must have them back	91.9183120727539
200/3605	Yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am I to act How can it be effected   Someone must be sent to the d	62.312652587890625
201/3605	But who who In whom can I trust   Place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and I will find a	186.91041564941406
202/3605	Two words from the hand of your Majesty and your private	782.9869384765625
203/3605	But these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile   Yes if they fell into infamous	743.3233642578125
204/3605	But I will answer for these two words being delivered to their	138.3784942626953
205/3605	Oh my God I must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands   Yes yes madame you must and I will save them	61.71486282348633
206/3605	But how Tell me at least the	212.92816162109375
207/3605	My husband had been at liberty these two or three	44.84407424926758
208/3605	I have not yet had time to see him	21.868803024291992
209/3605	He is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for	188.90817260742188
210/3605	He will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your Majestys letter without even knowing it is from your Majesty to the address which is on	280.1470031738281
211/3605	The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tender	79.23570251464844
212/3605	Do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor   Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your	53.043296813964844
213/3605	I have nothing to save for your Majesty you are only the victim of perfidious	271.8028259277344
214/3605	That is true that is true my child said the queen you are	34.883338928222656
215/3605	Give me then that letter madame time	3859.07421875
216/3605	The queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and	410.5002136230469
217/3605	She wrote two lines sealed the letter with her private seal and gave it to M	499.9864807128906
218/3605	And now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary	210.98350524902344
219/3605	What is that madame  	62.898956298828125
220/3605	Yes that is true said she and I will confess to your Majesty that my husband   Your husband has	52.699607849121094
221/3605	Is that what you would say   He has some but he is very avaricious that is his	58.46139144897461
222/3605	Nevertheless let not your Majesty be uneasy we will find	878.4249877929688
223/3605	And I have none either said the	105.8727798461914
224/3605	Those who have read the _Memoirs_ of M	1047.203857421875
225/3605	de Motteville will not be astonished at this	200.7181854248047
226/3605	Anne of Austria ran to her jewel	2051.211669921875
227/3605	Here said she here is a ring of great value as I have been	80.41129302978516
228/3605	It came from my brother the King of	305.390869140625

231/3605	In an hour you shall be ob	24.911651611328125
232/3605	You see the address said the queen speaking so low that M	545.0703125
233/3605	Bonacieux could hardly hear what she said To my Lord Duke of Buckingham	293.0839538574219
234/3605	The letter shall be given to	138.9326171875
235/3605	Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a	76.81282043457031
236/3605	Ten minutes afterward she was at	94.28286743164062
237/3605	As to the servant she had run away at the moment of her masters	68.30453491210938
238/3605	Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy her native	199.72402954101562
239/3605	The worthy mercer had immediately upon reentering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a	526.48779296875
240/3605	This first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to	432.154541015625
241/3605	Bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits Rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than	208.40121459960938
242/3605	This was the more so because Bonacieuxs reflections were all rosecol	250.40554809570312
243/3605	Rochefort called him his friend his dear Bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for	173.89878845214844
244/3605	The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	826.9468994140625
245/3605	Bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from	772.7384033203125
246/3605	In spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in	108.92317962646484
247/3605	Bonacieux having always lived among her husbands friendspeople little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her positionM	827.7027587890625
248/3605	Bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and DArtagnan was a	146.35244750976562
249/3605	Besides he wore the uniform of the Guards which next to that of the Musketeers was most admired by the	101.43479919433594
250/3605	He was we repeat handsome young and bold he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in	243.20741271972656
251/3605	There was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twentythree years old and M	240.7528533935547
252/3605	Bonacieux had just attained that happy period of	220.3013153076172
253/3605	The couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccup	68.62950897216797
254/3605	Nevertheless Bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open	307.5379943847656
255/3605	Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to	193.38909912109375
256/3605	Let us talk a little said	245.64834594726562
257/3605	Yes I have something of the highest importance to tell	63.62288284301758
258/3605	True said he and I have some questions sufficiently serious to put to	51.66471481323242
259/3605	Describe to me your abduction I pray	610.6008911132812
260/3605	Oh thats of no consequence just now said M	361.0294189453125
261/3605	You speak very much at your ease madame said Bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in	225.53302001953125
262/3605	Do you know that I was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille   Oh a day and night soon pass	108.94000244140625
263/3605	Let us return to the object that brings me	258.8803405761719
264/3605	What that which brings you home to me Is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week asked the mercer piqued to the	145.0172119140625
265/3605	Yes that first and other things	640.3847045898438
266/3605	It is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps	230.24591064453125
267/3605	The complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you Madame Bonacieux and I should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many	97.8306655883789
268/3605	Yes particularly if you follow the instructions I am about to give	60.36897659301758
269/3605	There is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same	81.03883361816406
270/3605	Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak	193.92080688476562
271/3605	But a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu is no longer the same	179.02418518066406
272/3605	Much money to be gained said Bonacieux protruding his	825.1193237304688
273/3605	About how much   A thousand pistoles	33.70048904418945
274/3605	What you demand of me is serious then   It is	54.689422607421875
275/3605	What must be done   You must go away	42.95870590209961
276/3605	I will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper	80.92144775390625
277/3605	And whither am I to go   To	83.1267318725586
278/3605	I go to London Go to You jest I have no business in	150.645263671875
279/3605	But others wish that you should go	133.69107055664062
280/3605	But who are those others I warn you that I will never again work in the dark and that I will know not only to what I expose myself but for whom I expose	76.42510986328125
281/3605	An illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits	802.1536254882812
282/3605	The recompense will exceed your expectations that is all I promise	181.40892028808594
283/3605	More intrigues Nothing but intrigues Thank you madame I am aware of them now Monsieur Cardinal has enlightened me on that	196.05442810058594
284/3605	Have you seen the cardinal   He sent for me answered the mercer	387.671875
285/3605	And you responded to his bidding you imprudent man   Well I cant say I had much choice of going or not going for I was taken to him between two	138.72926330566406
286/3605	It is true also that as I did not then know his Eminence if I had been able to dispense with the visit I should have been	48.3303108215332
287/3605	He illtreated you then he threatened you   He gave me his hand and called me his	85.07720184326172
288/3605	There are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should	499.8701477050781
289/3605	I am sorry for it madame but I acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom I have the honor to	38.70997619628906
290/3605	You serve the cardinal   Yes madame and as his servant I will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not French and who has a Spanish	59.87105178833008
291/3605	Fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the	431.6794128417969
292/3605	Nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her	279.5177307128906
293/3605	Ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen   Private interests are as nothing before the interests of	243.50192260742188
294/3605	I am for those who save the state said Bonacieux	745.0707397460938
295/3605	And what do you know about the state you talk of said M	155.68829345703125
296/3605	Be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most	1476.837158203125
297/3605	Madame replied Bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious Spaniard and what the cardinal does is well	208.12962341308594
298/3605	Bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her	142.8908233642578
299/3605	You meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics Why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money   No to the	538.5775146484375

302/3605	Yes you are right I should be ashamed for anyone to know your bas	85.99970245361328
303/3605	But what do you require of me then Let us	51.629981994628906
304/3605	You must accomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you and on that condition I pardon everything I forget everything and what is more and she held out her hand to him I restore my	257.5473937988281
305/3605	Bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his	134.8306884765625
306/3605	A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of twenty	2115.16162109375
307/3605	But my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of	226.92794799804688
308/3605	London is far from Paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers   What matters it if you avoid them   Hold Madame Bonacieux said the mercer hold I positively refuse intrigues terrify	324.5104064941406

310/3605	Do you know what torture is Wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out No positively I will not	1898.703125
311/3605	And _morbleu_ why do you not go yourself For in truth I think I have hitherto been deceived in	86.37257385253906

317/3605	Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so	110.08722686767578
318/3605	She for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by	443.16796875
319/3605	Perhaps when all is considered you are	117.81683349609375
320/3605	In the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you Monsieur Bonacieux have conversed with the	262.5274963378906
321/3605	And yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection I thought I might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my f	179.5152130126953
322/3605	That is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant Bonacieux and I mistrust	391.131103515625
323/3605	Well I will give it up then said the young woman sigh	31.44678497314453
324/3605	It is well as it is say no more about	47.03330993652344
325/3605	At least you should tell me what I should have to do in London replied Bonacieux who remembered a little too late that Rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wifes	74.8938980102539
326/3605	It is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw	89.59545135498047
327/3605	It was about one of those purchases that interest womena purchase by which much might have been	534.1961669921875
328/3605	But the more the young woman excused herself the more important Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to	254.084228515625
329/3605	He resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de Rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to	42.10283660888672
330/3605	Pardon me for quitting you my dear Madame Bonacieux said he but not knowing you would come to see me I had made an engagement with a	69.0328140258789
331/3605	I shall soon return and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late I will come back and reconduct you to the Lou	84.014404296875
332/3605	Thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied M	82.84415435791016
333/3605	I shall return very safely to the Louvre all	276.204345703125
334/3605	As you please Madame Bonacieux said the exmer	993.973388671875
335/3605	Shall I see you again soon   Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and I will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much der	122.66790008544922
336/3605	You are not angry with me   Not the least in the	14.128453254699707
337/3605	Till then then   Till	1894.937744140625
338/3605	Bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick	74.130615234375
339/3605	Bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinal	205.22592163085938
340/3605	LOVER AND HUSBAND     Ah Madame said DArtagnan entering by the door which the young woman opened for him allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a	192.38995361328125
341/3605	You have then overheard our conversation asked M	1017.2838134765625
342/3605	Bonacieux eagerly and looking at DArtagnan with dis	41.95339584350586
343/3605	But how my God   By a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which I likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinals	189.88343811035156
344/3605	And what did you understand by what we said   A thousand	71.03299713134766
345/3605	I have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here I	127.70573425292969
346/3605	Bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her	122.27581024169922
347/3605	And what guarantee will you give me asked she if I consent to confide this message to you   My love for	125.20480346679688
348/3605	Speak Command What is to be done   My God my God murmured the young woman ought I to confide such a secret to you monsieur You are almost a	69.45313262939453
349/3605	I see that you require someone to answer for me   I admit that would reassure me	144.09857177734375
350/3605	Do you know Athos  	14.308969497680664
351/3605	Who are these gentleman   Three of the kings Musket	72.48779296875
352/3605	Do you know Monsieur de Tréville their captain   Oh yes him I know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal	39.02756118774414
353/3605	You do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal   Oh no certainly not   Well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to	102.40898895263672
354/3605	But this secret is not mine and I cannot reveal it in this	51.38798904418945
355/3605	You were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux said DArtagnan with chag	73.5760726928711
356/3605	As one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a	171.44667053222656
357/3605	And yet meyou see plainly that I love	121.3332748413086
358/3605	Oh I am sure of that   Then put me to the	57.78425979614258
359/3605	Bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in	128.7386474609375
360/3605	Besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of	145.614013671875
361/3605	The queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence andlet us admit itthe involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to	576.6185913085938
362/3605	Listen said she I yield to your protestations I yield to your	209.89906311035156
363/3605	But I swear to you before God who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me I will kill myself while accusing you of my	79.62126159667969
364/3605	And II swear to you before God madame said DArtagnan that if I am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me I will die sooner than do anything that may compromise	128.34304809570312
365/3605	Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the Samarit	203.18064880371094
366/3605	This was their mutual declaration of	617.8612060546875
367/3605	DArtagnan was radiant with joy and	34.12086868286133
368/3605	This secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved Confidence and love made him a	487.8540344238281
369/3605	I go said he I go at	69.73204040527344
370/3605	Bonacieux and your regiment your captain   By my soul you had made me forget all that dear Constance Yes you are right a furlough is need	344.5513916015625
371/3605	As to that cried DArtagnan after a moment of reflection I shall surmount it be	87.73867797851562
372/3605	How so   I will go this very evening to Tréville whom I will request to ask this favor for me of his brotherinlaw Monsieur Dessess	108.2056884765625
373/3605	You have perhaps no money   _Perhaps_ is too much said DArtagnan	98.33625793457031
374/3605	Bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this	221.1572265625
375/3605	The cardinals cried DArtagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his	239.18817138671875
376/3605	You see it makes a very respectable	1158.579833984375
377/3605	_Pardieu_ cried DArtagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinals money   You are an amiable and charming young man said M	69.94163513183594
378/3605	Be assured you will not find her Majesty ungr	200.34515380859375
379/3605	Oh I am already grandly recompensed cried DArtagn	59.570960998535156
380/3605	I love you you permit me to tell you that I dothat is already more happiness than I dared to	70.73788452148438
381/3605	What   Someone is talking in the	122.60626983642578
382/3605	It is the voice of   Of my husband Yes I recognize it   DArtagnan ran to the door and pushed the	38.9010124206543
383/3605	He shall not come in before I am gone said he and when I am gone you can open to	79.80024719238281
384/3605	But I ought to be gone	65.64617919921875
385/3605	And the disappearance of his money how am I to justify it if I am here   You are right we must go	54.68498992919922
386/3605	Go out How He will see us if we go	204.72775268554688
387/3605	Then you must come up into my	70.00926971435547
388/3605	Bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me   M	105.43311309814453
389/3605	Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her	40.45294952392578
390/3605	DArtagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her	272.8330383300781
391/3605	With me you will be as safe as in a temple I give you my word of a	77.87198638916016
392/3605	Once there for greater security the young man barricaded the	132.74647521972656
393/3605	They both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw Bonacieux talking with a man in a	268.80096435546875
394/3605	At sight of this man DArtagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the	33.89628601074219
395/3605	What are you going to do cried M	57.35443115234375
396/3605	Bonacieux you will ruin us all   But I have sworn to kill that man said DArtagn	27.360788345336914
397/3605	Your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to	78.7921371459961
398/3605	In the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your	136.07070922851562
399/3605	And do you command nothing in your own name   In my name said M	68.82295227050781
400/3605	Bonacieux with great emotion in my name I beg you But listen they appear to be speaking of	116.87206268310547
401/3605	DArtagnan drew near the window and lent his	41.5237922668457
402/3605	Bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an	39.496944427490234
403/3605	She is gone said he she must have returned to the Lou	59.61958312988281
404/3605	You are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out   No replied Bonacieux with a selfsufficient air she is too superficial a	164.59164428710938
405/3605	Is the young Guardsman at home   I do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shut	112.2169189453125
406/3605	All the same it is well to be	110.14319610595703
407/3605	How so   By knocking at his	99.54385375976562
408/3605	Bonacieux reentered the house passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives went up to DArtagnans door and	44.485111236572266
409/3605	Porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed Planc	136.5626220703125
410/3605	As to DArtagnan he took care not to give the least sign of	45.04115676879883
411/3605	The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within	140.39071655273438
412/3605	We shall be safer there than in the	257.0815124511719
413/3605	On the contrary said DArtagnan we shall hear	17.682214736938477
414/3605	DArtagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of Dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to M	143.375
415/3605	Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the	203.43533325195312
416/3605	You are sure there is nobody there said the	228.94497680664062
417/3605	I will answer for it said Bonacie	69.70448303222656
418/3605	And you think that your wife   Has returned to the Lou	91.7097396850586
419/3605	Without speaking to anyone but yourself   I am sure of	21.756616592407227
420/3605	That is an important point do you understand   Then the news I brought you is of value   The greatest my dear Bonacieux I dont conceal this from	131.0308074951172
421/3605	Then the cardinal will be pleased with me   I have no doubt of	15.358853340148926
422/3605	The great cardinal   Are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names   I think	98.92657470703125
423/3605	She did not name Madame de Chevreuse the Duke of Buckingham or Madame de Vernet   No she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the interests of an illustrious person	71.54847717285156
424/3605	Silence said DArtagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to	75.7330551147461
425/3605	Never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the	120.92422485351562
426/3605	You would then be in present possession of the	78.9620590209961
427/3605	The state which is now threatened would be safe and you   And I   Well youthe cardinal would have given you letters of	154.23866271972656
428/3605	Did he tell you so   Yes I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable	74.25347900390625
429/3605	Be satisfied replied Bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet	617.0750732421875
430/3605	Silence said DArtagnan pressing her hand more	73.47657012939453
431/3605	How is there still time asked the man in the	77.01372528076172
432/3605	I go to the Louvre I ask for M	80.98918914794922
433/3605	Bonacieux I say that I have reflected I renew the affair I obtain the letter and I run directly to the	131.6596221923828
434/3605	Well go quickly I will return soon to learn the result of your	234.16099548339844
435/3605	Bonacieux addressing this epithet to her	373.0092468261719
436/3605	Silence said DArtagnan pressing her hand still more warm	53.946434020996094
437/3605	A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of DArtagnan and M	468.5699768066406
438/3605	It was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying Thieves   Oh my God cried M	173.37840270996094
439/3605	Bonacieux he will rouse the whole	182.38450622558594
440/3605	Now he is gone it is your turn to get out said M	111.07208251953125
441/3605	Courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the	136.11224365234375
442/3605	To her and to you cried DArtagn	41.71489715576172
443/3605	I shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall I likewise return worthy of your love   The young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her	114.02528381347656
444/3605	A few seconds afterward DArtagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which illconcealed the sheath of a long	69.30763244628906
445/3605	PLAN OF CAMPAIGN     DArtagnan went straight to	2131.947509765625
446/3605	He had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to	108.23406219482422
447/3605	The heart of the young man overflowed with	74.58210754394531
448/3605	An opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he ad	244.35507202148438
449/3605	This chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of	78.66510009765625
450/3605	de Tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of	224.8705596923828
451/3605	DArtagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of	54.0871467590332
452/3605	DArtagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when	40.83360290527344
453/3605	At the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on	157.902587890625
454/3605	All the way along DArtagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in	190.28070068359375
455/3605	de Tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him _carte blanche_ for some secret	308.88507080078125
456/3605	de Tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him	69.6099853515625
457/3605	Did you ask for me my good friend said	48.403953552246094
458/3605	Yes monsieur said DArtagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me I hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my	25.2215633392334
459/3605	It concerns nothing less said DArtagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the	71.0838851928711
460/3605	de Tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon DArtagn	137.3669891357422
461/3605	I say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret   Which you will guard I hope young man as your	62.28861618041992
462/3605	But which I must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission I have just received from her	77.35393524169922
463/3605	Is this secret your own   No monsieur it is her Majest	130.17129516601562
464/3605	Are you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me   No monsieur for on the contrary I am desired to preserve the profoundest	131.3616943359375
465/3605	Why then are you about to betray it to me   Because as I said without you I can do nothing and I am afraid you will refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I ask	39.893226623535156
466/3605	Keep your secret young man and tell me what you	44.720455169677734
467/3605	I wish you to obtain for me from Monsieur Dessessart leave of absence for fifteen	398.8656311035156
468/3605	You leave Paris   I am going on a	49.76661682128906
469/3605	May you tell me whither   To	73.6546630859375
470/3605	Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there   The cardinal I believe would give the world to prevent my	178.0478057861328
471/3605	And you are going alone   I am going	28.392854690551758
472/3605	In that case you will not get beyond Bond	2161.33642578125
473/3605	I tell you so by the faith of de Tré	82.02017974853516
474/3605	How so   You will be	81.88648986816406
475/3605	And I shall die in the performance of my	42.78424835205078
476/3605	But your mission will not be	57.286319732666016
477/3605	Believe me continued Tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set	306.1694641113281
478/3605	Ah you are right monsieur said DArtagnan but you know Athos Porthos and Aramis and you know if I can dispose of	9.703384399414062
479/3605	Without confiding to them the secret which I am not willing to know   We are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all	188.6672821044922
480/3605	Besides you can tell them that you have full confidence in me and they will not be more incredulous than	29.45816993713379
481/3605	Sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their	722.4404296875
482/3605	You are a hundred times too	67.85049438476562
483/3605	Begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight Ha But first write your request to Dessess	2880.132080078125
484/3605	Perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem	138.06443786621094
485/3605	DArtagnan drew up his request and	75.17253875732422
486/3605	de Tréville on receiving it assured him that by two oclock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the	162.3072052001953
487/3605	Have the goodness to send mine to Athoss	598.94921875
488/3605	I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go	256.968505859375
489/3605	Have you any money   DArtagnan tapped the bag he had in his	47.51171112060547
490/3605	Oh plenty That would carry you to the end of the	129.41751098632812
491/3605	Begone then   DArtagnan saluted	49.36075210571289
492/3605	de Tréville who held out his hand to him DArtagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with	47.43932342529297
493/3605	Since his first arrival at Paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and	280.86419677734375
494/3605	His first visit was to Aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed M	111.4273452758789
495/3605	Still further he had seldom seen the young Musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his count	107.82901763916016
496/3605	This evening especially Aramis was melancholy and	534.7905883789062
497/3605	DArtagnan asked some questions about this prolonged	199.9074249267578
498/3605	Augustine which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good	144.97723388671875
499/3605	After the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from	115.19830322265625
500/3605	de Tréville entered bringing a sealed	537.8093872070312
501/3605	The leave of absence Monsieur has asked for replied the lac	142.9718017578125
502/3605	For me I have asked for no leave of	211.52615356445312
503/3605	Hold your tongue and take it said DArtagn	23.882795333862305
504/3605	And you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell Monsieur de Tréville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to	24.161527633666992
505/3605	The lackey bowed to the ground and	43.256492614746094
506/3605	What does all this mean asked Aram	32.26124572753906
507/3605	Pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow	105.19387817382812
508/3605	But I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing   Aramis	66.53915405273438
509/3605	What is become of her I suppose you mean continued DArtagn	53.88367462158203
510/3605	The woman who was herethe woman with the embroidered handker	73.21346282958984
511/3605	Who told you there was a woman here replied Aramis becoming as pale as	90.02906799316406
512/3605	And you know who she is   I believe I can guess at	37.675453186035156
513/3605	Since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman   I presume that she has returned to	40.5942497253418
514/3605	But why did she return to Tours without telling me anything   Because she was in fear of being	92.6034164428711
515/3605	Why has she not written to me then   Because she was afraid of compromising	58.815345764160156
516/3605	DArtagnan you restore me to life cried Aram	65.55059051513672
517/3605	I was so delighted to see her again I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris   For the cause which today takes us to	73.87604522705078
518/3605	And what is this cause demanded Aram	92.44361114501953
519/3605	Oh youll know it someday Aramis but at present I must imitate the discretion of the doctors	704.1796875
520/3605	Aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain	97.27279663085938
521/3605	Well then since she has left Paris and you are sure of it DArtagnan nothing prevents me and I am ready to follow	26.02187728881836
522/3605	You say we are going   To see Athos now and if you will come thither I beg you to make haste for we have lost much time	54.47751235961914
523/3605	Will Bazin go with us asked Aram	89.81407165527344
524/3605	At all events it is best that he should follow us to Ath	95.47036743164062
525/3605	Aramis called Bazin and after having ordered him to join them at Athoss residence said Let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray	163.5223388671875
526/3605	When well assured this search was superfluous he followed DArtagnan wondering to himself how this young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of	155.07894897460938
527/3605	Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of DArtagnan and looking at him earnestly You have not spoken of this lady said	30.542951583862305
528/3605	Not even to Athos or Porthos   I have not breathed a syllable to	23.363845825195312
529/3605	Good enough   Tranquil on this important point Aramis continued his way with DArtagnan and both soon arrived at Athoss	270.4886779785156
530/3605	They found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and	148.46871948242188
531/3605	Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which I have just received said the astonished Ath	120.28657531738281
532/3605	MY DEAR ATHOS     I wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest     for a	646.547607421875
533/3605	Go then and take the waters of Forges or any     that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as     quickly as	707.4031372070312
534/3605	Yours affectionate DE TRÉVILLE     Well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me Ath	973.5944213867188
535/3605	To the waters of Forges   There or	823.2800903320312
536/3605	In the kings service   Either the kings or the	121.61083221435547
537/3605	Are we not their Majesties servants   At that moment Porthos	167.17138671875
538/3605	_Pardieu_ said he here is a strange thing Since when I wonder in the Musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it   Since said DArtagnan they have friends who ask it for	93.7768325805664
539/3605	Ah ah said Porthos it appears theres something fresh	91.37964630126953
540/3605	My faith I dont know much about it said Ath	45.436126708984375
541/3605	To London cried Porthos and what the devil are we going to do in London   That is what I am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to	22.299339294433594
542/3605	But in order to go to London added Porthos money is needed and I have	63.36217498779297
543/3605	I have replied DArtagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the	21.990482330322266
544/3605	There are in this bag three hundred pist	250.52426147460938
545/3605	Let each take seventyfive that is enough to take us to London and	561.7318725585938
546/3605	Besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at	322.992431640625
547/3605	Why so   Because in all probability some one of us will be left on the	30.254981994628906
548/3605	Is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering   One of a most dangerous kind I give you	163.9688720703125
549/3605	Ah But if we do risk being killed said Porthos at least I should like to know what	48.79413986206055
550/3605	You would be all the wiser said Ath	196.86419677734375
551/3605	And yet said Aramis I am somewhat of Porthoss	88.21792602539062
552/3605	Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	371.3236999511719
553/3605	He says to you jauntily Gentlemen there is fighting going on in Gascony or in Flanders go and fight and you go	593.88427734375
554/3605	Why You need give yourselves no more uneasiness about	204.5644073486328
555/3605	DArtagnan is right said Athos here are our three leaves of absence which came from Monsieur de Tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from I dont know	38.5599365234375
556/3605	So let us go and get killed where we are told to	57.96684646606445
557/3605	Is life worth the trouble of so many questions DArtagnan I am ready to follow	47.5169563293457
558/3605	And indeed I am not sorry to quit Paris I had need of	91.64591217041016
559/3605	Well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said DArtagn	125.19334411621094
560/3605	And now when are we to go asked Ath	35.36369705200195
561/3605	Immediately replied DArtagnan we have not a minute to	80.2514419555664
562/3605	Hello Grimaud Planchet Mousqueton Bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hô	107.18755340576172
563/3605	Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lac	267.4344177246094
564/3605	Planchet Grimaud Mousqueton and Bazin set off at full	10.315627098083496
565/3605	Now let us lay down the plan of campaign said Porth	92.25765228271484
566/3605	Where do we go first   To Calais said DArtagnan that is the most direct line to	62.93435287475586
567/3605	Well said Porthos this is my advice   Speak   Four men traveling together would be	75.33204650878906
568/3605	DArtagnan will give each of us his	48.649574279785156
569/3605	Gentlemen said Athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an	97.38716125488281
570/3605	A secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lac	552.7035522460938
571/3605	Porthoss plan appears to me to be impracticable said DArtagnan inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give	46.14347839355469
572/3605	I am the bearer of a letter that is	18.024328231811523
573/3605	I have not and I cannot make three copies of that letter because it is	124.61026763916016
574/3605	We must then as it appears to me travel in	280.1249694824219
575/3605	This letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the	76.88372039794922
576/3605	If I should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be anothers turn and so onprovided a single one arrives that is all that is	148.06044006347656
577/3605	Bravo DArtagnan your opinion is mine cried Athos Besides we must be consistent I am going to take the waters you will accompany	109.35079193115234
578/3605	Instead of taking the waters of Forges I go and take sea waters I am free to do	433.548583984375
579/3605	If anyone wishes to stop us I will show Monsieur de Trévilles letter and you will show your leaves of	196.99913024902344
580/3605	If we are attacked we will defend ourselves if we are tried we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the	196.59535217285156
581/3605	They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a	773.3329467773438
582/3605	We will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as DArtagnan says will carry the	184.6377410888672
583/3605	Well said cried Aramis you dont often speak Athos but when you do speak it is like	121.55425262451172
584/3605	And you Porthos   I agree to it too said Porthos if DArtagnan approves of	24.145015716552734
585/3605	DArtagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will	70.61995697021484
586/3605	Well said DArtagnan I decide that we should adopt Athoss plan and that we set off in half an	37.772544860839844
587/3605	Agreed shouted the three Musketeers in	949.051025390625
588/3605	Each one stretching out his hand to the bag took his seventyfive pistoles and made his preparations to set out at the time	97.13972473144531
589/3605	THE JOURNEY     At two oclock in the morning our four adventurers left Paris by the Barrière	206.7238311767578
590/3605	As long as it was dark they remained silent in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every	265.1498107910156
591/3605	With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened with the sun gaiety	531.1900024414062
592/3605	It was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good	217.224609375
593/3605	Besides the appearance of the caravan was	617.6099243164062
594/3605	The black horses of the Musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incogn	235.71018981933594
595/3605	The lackeys followed armed to the	417.34893798828125
596/3605	All went well till they arrived at Chantilly which they reached about eight oclock in the	34.77436065673828
597/3605	They needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an _auberge_ recommended by a sign representing	339.9494323730469
598/3605	Martin giving half his cloak to a poor	450.4541320800781
599/3605	They ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again	173.7518310546875
600/3605	They entered the common hall and placed themselves at	168.44491577148438
601/3605	A gentleman who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfast	61.24796676635742
602/3605	He opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers	1900.70849609375
603/3605	He drank to their good health and the travelers returned his polit	216.417236328125
604/3605	But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to Porthos to drink the health of the	52.707420349121094
605/3605	Porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the	83.86111450195312
606/3605	The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his Emin	364.6219177246094
607/3605	Porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his	73.0081558227539
608/3605	You have committed a piece of folly said Athos but it cant be helped there is no drawing	138.33436584472656
609/3605	Kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you	48.85468292236328
610/3605	All three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing	182.75355529785156
611/3605	There goes one cried Athos at the end of five hundred p	53.05972671508789
612/3605	But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us asked Aram	62.01826858520508
613/3605	Because as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said DArtagn	37.76441192626953
614/3605	I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom murmured Athos and the travelers continued their	424.6767272949219
615/3605	At Beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for Porth	106.7926254272461
616/3605	At the end of two hours as Porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their	58.494903564453125
617/3605	At a league from Beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with	292.90887451171875
618/3605	Aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather	5452.478515625
619/3605	Athos wished to restrain him but it was too	36.539093017578125
620/3605	The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos who urged on his horse against one of	615.040771484375
621/3605	Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in	562.781494140625
622/3605	Aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the lo	189.3099822998047
623/3605	Therefore Mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really	93.2564468383789
624/3605	Dont waste a charge Forward   Aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the	149.9319305419922
625/3605	Mousquetons horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his	45.346195220947266
626/3605	That will serve us for a relay said Ath	206.63186645507812
627/3605	I would rather have had a hat said DArtagn	27.262195587158203
628/3605	Mine was carried away by a	106.19996643066406
629/3605	By my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in	51.04212188720703
630/3605	Theyll kill poor Porthos when he comes up said Aram	108.7691879272461
631/3605	If Porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said Ath	38.0272331237793
632/3605	My opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not	161.80392456054688
633/3605	They continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse	148.7158660888672
634/3605	The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption but at Crèvecœur Aramis declared he could proceed no	839.4136962890625
635/3605	In fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so	202.28741455078125
636/3605	He grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his	123.20663452148438
637/3605	They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left Bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Am	151.35882568359375
638/3605	_Morbleu_ said Athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and Grimaud and Planchet _Morbleu_ I wont be their dupe I will answer for	71.25020599365234
639/3605	I will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and	189.32369995117188
640/3605	I swear by   Dont waste time in swearing said DArtagnan let us gallop if our horses will	97.93307495117188
641/3605	And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their	3979.7822265625
642/3605	They arrived at Amiens at midnight and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden	278.1653747558594
643/3605	The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on	243.16160583496094
644/3605	He received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the	195.38687133789062
645/3605	He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hô	132.36476135253906
646/3605	The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the	139.513427734375
647/3605	The host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they	93.96080017089844
648/3605	They had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the	323.50604248046875
649/3605	Grimaud can take care of the horses said Planc	91.90065002441406
650/3605	If you are willing gentlemen I will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach	173.0399627685547
651/3605	And on what will you sleep said DArtagn	26.220911026000977
652/3605	Here is my bed replied Planchet producing a bundle of	216.86578369140625
653/3605	Come then said DArtagnan you are	7.326228141784668
654/3605	Mine hosts face does not please me at all it is too	330.1700439453125
655/3605	Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five oclock in the morning he and the four horses should be	63.151363372802734
656/3605	Toward two oclock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door but as Planchet awoke in an instant and cried Who goes there somebody replied that he was mistaken and went	85.20797729492188
657/3605	At four oclock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the st	41.84702682495117
658/3605	Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten	3276.0751953125
659/3605	When they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitch	458.32293701171875
660/3605	Planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used	47.419715881347656
661/3605	All these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a	308.401611328125
662/3605	Athos and DArtagnan went out while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were not three horses for sale in the	37.72536849975586
663/3605	At the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully	2666.42529296875
664/3605	He asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the	130.6987762451172
665/3605	Athos went down to pay the reckoning while DArtagnan and Planchet stood at the street	39.792049407958984
666/3605	The host was in a lower and back room to which Athos was requested to	168.75025939941406
667/3605	Athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the	154.36412048339844
668/3605	The host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly	94.6593246459961
669/3605	He took the money which Athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as for	188.72540283203125
670/3605	You blackguard cried Athos going toward him Ill cut your ears off   At the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon Ath	219.60101318359375
671/3605	I am taken shouted Athos with all the power of his	114.88951110839844
672/3605	Go on DArtagnan Spur spur and he fired two	158.96713256835938
673/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gall	61.50759506225586
674/3605	Do you know what has become of Athos asked DArtagnan of Planchet as they galloped	19.079662322998047
675/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet I saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the	75.3282699584961
676/3605	Brave Athos murmured DArtagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces	70.25469207763672
677/3605	Forward Planchet forward You are a brave	70.01448059082031
678/3605	As I told you monsieur replied Planchet Picards are found out by being	168.2710418701172
679/3605	Besides I am here in my own country and that excites	101.81437683105469
680/3605	And both with free use of the spur arrived at	1104.7030029296875
681/3605	Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed	147.87960815429688
682/3605	At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais DArtagnans horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his	63.944297790527344
683/3605	There still remained Planchets horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a	103.63117218017578
684/3605	Fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the qu	46.47764205932617
685/3605	Planchet called his masters attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty p	41.544944763183594
686/3605	They made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great	75.87109375
687/3605	His boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to	170.41529846191406
688/3605	Nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the	129.48313903808594
689/3605	I have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket here it	68.8071060180664

692/3605	And that is situated   At a quarter of a league from the	18.8260498046875
693/3605	Look you may see it from hereat the foot of that little hill that slated	1354.0966796875
694/3605	And with his lackey he took the road to the governors country	58.84218978881836
695/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred p	13.717483520507812
696/3605	Once outside the city DArtagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little	96.99082946777344
697/3605	Monsieur you appear to be in great haste   No one can be more so monsie	24.97641944885254
698/3605	I am sorry for that said DArtagnan for as I am in great haste likewise I wish to beg you to render me a	32.63015365600586
699/3605	What   To let me sail	105.85944366455078

701/3605	I have performed that same distance in forty hours and by ten oclock in the morning I must be in	53.44722366333008
702/3605	Very sorry monsieur but I was here first and will not sail	188.96466064453125
703/3605	I am sorry too monsieur but I arrived second and must sail	166.91378784179688
704/3605	But this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to	93.93862915039062
705/3605	_Parbleu_ What do you desire it to be   What do you want   Would you like to know  	18.15718650817871
706/3605	Well then I wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that I have not one of my own and must have	77.94881439208984
707/3605	Let me pass   You shall not	167.38577270507812
708/3605	My brave young man I will blow out your	61.506858825683594
709/3605	_Hola_ Lubin my pistols   Planchet called out DArtagnan take care of the lackey I will manage the	246.30987548828125
710/3605	Planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon Lubin and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his	516.1493530273438
711/3605	Go on with your affair monsieur cried Planchet I have finished	82.76593780517578
712/3605	Seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon DArtagnan but he had too strong an	56.9862174987793
713/3605	In three seconds DArtagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust One for Athos one for Porthos and one for Aramis   At the third hit the gentleman fell like a	141.23883056640625
714/3605	This time the gentleman closed his eyes and f	147.7777557373047
715/3605	DArtagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the	72.11122131347656
716/3605	It was in the name of Comte de Ward	284.9233703613281
717/3605	But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his	514.6195068359375
718/3605	Planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he	51.19560623168945
719/3605	Monsieur said he as long as I hold him in this manner he cant cry Ill be bound but as soon as I let go he will howl	202.28298950195312
720/3605	I know him for a Norman and Normans are obst	411.2733154296875
721/3605	In fact tightly held as he was Lubin endeavored still to cry	4705.6142578125
722/3605	Stay said DArtagnan and taking out his handkerchief he gagged	18.76279067993164
723/3605	Now said Planchet let us bind him to a	42.40465545654297
724/3605	This being properly done they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his servant and as night was approaching and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next	236.63059997558594
725/3605	And now said DArtagnan to the	44.19483947753906
726/3605	But you are wounded it seems said Planc	69.52214813232422
727/3605	Oh thats nothing Let us attend to what is more pressing first and then we will attend to my wound besides it does not seem very	166.45223999023438
728/3605	And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy function	89.94355010986328
729/3605	The Comte de Wardes was announced and DArtagnan was	144.54396057128906
730/3605	You have an order signed by the cardinal said the	107.8843002319336
731/3605	Yes monsieur replied DArtagnan here it	7.866882801055908
732/3605	Ah ah It is quite regular and explicit said the	1029.604736328125
733/3605	Most likely said DArtagnan I am one of his most faithful	29.409460067749023
734/3605	It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to England   Yes a certain DArtagnan a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to	159.8606719970703
735/3605	Do you know him personally asked the	72.48391723632812
736/3605	And DArtagnan gave feature for feature a description of the Comte de Ward	377.7575988769531
737/3605	Is he accompanied   Yes by a lackey named Lub	871.267822265625
738/3605	We will keep a sharp lookout for them and if we lay hands on them his Eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good	82.62449645996094
739/3605	And by doing so Monsieur the Governor said DArtagnan you will deserve well of the	67.05838012695312
740/3605	Shall you see him on your return Monsieur Count   Without a	61.42449951171875
741/3605	Tell him I beg you that I am his humble	108.21626281738281
742/3605	Delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to DArtagn	140.68739318847656
743/3605	DArtagnan lost no time in useless	82.42259216308594
744/3605	He thanked the governor bowed and	523.9133911132812
745/3605	Once outside he and Planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another	134.36813354492188
746/3605	The vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wh	68.55856323242188
747/3605	Here is my pass countersigned said the	1397.6826171875
748/3605	And that other gentleman   He will not go today said DArtagnan but here Ill pay you for us	54.66059112548828
749/3605	In that case let us go said the ship	158.9965362548828
750/3605	He leaped with Planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on	31.701396942138672
751/3605	It was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when DArtagnan saw a flash and heard a deton	90.3109130859375
752/3605	It was the cannon which announced the closing of the	141.63107299804688
753/3605	He had now leisure to look to his	1002.0965576171875
754/3605	Fortunately as DArtagnan had thought it was not	24.310091018676758
755/3605	The point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the	514.8151245117188
756/3605	Still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of	166.8154296875
757/3605	A mattress was laid upon the deck for	200.48257446289062
758/3605	He threw himself upon it and fell	53.77287292480469
759/3605	On the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of	88.11573028564453
760/3605	The breeze had been so light all night they had made but little	504.30523681640625
761/3605	At ten oclock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of Dover and at half past ten DArtagnan placed his foot on English land crying Here I am at last   But that was not all they must get to	122.15383911132812
762/3605	In England the post was well	1427.708251953125
763/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before	132.23184204101562
764/3605	In a few hours they were in the	44.207679748535156
765/3605	DArtagnan did not know London he did not know a word of English but he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the dukes hô	47.85063552856445
766/3605	The duke was at Windsor hunting with the	817.62451171875
767/3605	DArtagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke French perfectly well he told him that he came from Paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master	83.4150390625
768/3605	The confidence with which DArtagnan spoke convinced Patrick which was the name of this minister of the	106.38424682617188
769/3605	He ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young Guards	253.68594360351562
770/3605	As for Planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush the poor lads strength was almost	142.883544921875
771/3605	On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues	295.0516662597656
772/3605	In twenty minutes they were on the spot	175.90679931640625
773/3605	Patrick soon caught the sound of his masters voice calling his fal	638.9032592773438
774/3605	Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke asked	6271.5947265625
775/3605	The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont Neuf opposite the Samarit	209.38624572753906
776/3605	A singular introduction   You will find that it is as good as	130.48524475097656
777/3605	Patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited	217.8769989013672
778/3605	No misfortune has happened to the queen cried Buckingham the instant he came up throwing all his fear and love into the	420.33251953125
779/3605	I believe not nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from which your Grace alone can extricate	664.2880249023438
780/3605	What is it I should be too happy to be of any service to	50.542694091796875
781/3605	Speak speak   Take this letter said DArtagn	54.42805862426758
782/3605	This letter From whom comes this letter   From her Majesty as I	622.505859375
783/3605	From her Majesty said Buckingham becoming so pale that DArtagnan feared he would faint as he broke the	295.3316345214844
784/3605	What is this rent said he showing DArtagnan a place where it had been pierced	142.1513671875
785/3605	Ah said DArtagnan I did not see that it was the sword of the Comte de Wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the	53.58738708496094
786/3605	You are wounded asked Buckingham as he opened the	332.01416015625
787/3605	Oh nothing but a scratch said DArtagn	25.663341522216797

789/3605	Patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his Majesty that I humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to	169.23487854003906
790/3605	Come monsieur come and both set off towards the capital at full gall	44.47332000732422
791/3605	THE COUNTESS DE WINTER     As they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from DArtagnan not all that had happened but what DArtagnan himself	252.669921875
792/3605	By adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queens letter short but explicit gave him the	203.00914001464844
793/3605	But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in England had not succeeded in arresting him on the	152.58973693847656
794/3605	The horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of	39.3651237487793
795/3605	DArtagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not	83.72769927978516
796/3605	He kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the	512.2906494140625
797/3605	In fact in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked	156.1059112548828
798/3605	DArtagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled	646.2313232421875
799/3605	On entering the court of his hôtel Buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestib	73.5885238647461
800/3605	DArtagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the st	118.89273071289062
801/3605	The duke walked so fast that DArtagnan had some trouble in keeping up with	61.9767951965332
802/3605	He passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of	122.86611938476562
803/3605	In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same	82.94412231445312
804/3605	Encouraged by this invitation DArtagnan followed the duke who closed the door after	49.229331970214844
805/3605	The two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of	178.64659118652344
806/3605	Over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a fulllength portrait of Anne of Austria so perfect in its resemblance that DArtagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding	167.35003662109375
807/3605	One might believe the queen was about to	110.83976745605469
808/3605	On the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond stud	331.260986328125
809/3605	The duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the c	160.9556121826172
810/3605	There said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with	118.73602294921875
811/3605	The queen gave them to me the queen requires them	223.97882080078125
812/3605	Her will be done like that of God in all	116.61920928955078
813/3605	Then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to	151.77981567382812
814/3605	All at once he uttered a terrible	37.77418518066406
815/3605	What is the matter exclaimed DArtagnan anxiously what has happened to you my Lord   All is lost cried Buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only	76.7112808227539
816/3605	Can you have lost them my Lord or do you think they have been stolen   They have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this	80.57710266113281
817/3605	Hold see The ribbons which held them have been cut with	610.2504272460938
818/3605	If my Lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his	604.3609008789062
819/3605	The only time I have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at	558.4461059570312
820/3605	The Comtesse de Winter with whom I had quarreled became reconciled to me at that	141.99203491210938
821/3605	That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous	1092.58544921875
822/3605	I have never seen her from that	46.06050491333008
823/3605	The woman is an agent of the	85.79425048828125
824/3605	He has agents then throughout the world cried DArtagn	184.6763153076172
825/3605	Oh yes said Buckingham grating his teeth with	274.8351135253906
826/3605	But when is this ball to take place   Monday	693.6333618164062
827/3605	Monday next Still five days before	2710.51611328125
828/3605	Patrick cried the duke opening the door of the chapel Patrick His confidential valet	204.92347717285156
829/3605	The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without	243.0357208251953
830/3605	But although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his	212.8897705078125
831/3605	This was simply because he lived in the hô	182.91806030273438
832/3605	He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own	183.7340850830078
833/3605	Jackson said he go instantly to the Lord Chancellor and tell him that I charge him with the execution of these	127.63431549072266
834/3605	I wish them to be promulgated	2054.72998046875
835/3605	But my Lord if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall I reply   That such is my pleasure and that I answer for my will to no	375.28875732421875
836/3605	Will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his Majesty if by chance his Majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great Britain   You are right	207.153076171875
837/3605	He will say in that case to the king that I am determined on war and that this measure is my first act of hostility against	116.38988494873047
838/3605	We are safe on that side said Buckingham turning toward DArtagn	50.17097854614258
839/3605	If the studs are not yet gone to Paris they will not arrive till after	92.79622650146484
840/3605	How so   I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his Majestys ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an	1405.723876953125
841/3605	DArtagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrig	76.51481628417969
842/3605	Buckingham saw by the expression of the young mans face what was passing in his mind and he	91.50997924804688
843/3605	Yes said he yes Anne of Austria is my true	136.28512573242188
844/3605	Upon a word from her I would betray my country I would betray my king I would betray my	170.07199096679688
845/3605	She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle the assistance I promised them I have not done	179.39292907714844
846/3605	I broke my word it is true but what signifies that I obeyed my love and have I not been richly paid for that obedience It was to that obedience I owe her	204.7027587890625
847/3605	DArtagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are	435.11181640625
848/3605	He was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith	505.4996337890625
849/3605	He was an Irishmanone of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of	83.1536865234375
850/3605	OReilly said the duke leading him into the chapel look at these diamond studs and tell me what they are worth	244.5449676513672
851/3605	The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set calculated one with another what the diamonds were worth and without hesitation said Fifteen hundred pistoles each my	516.189697265625
852/3605	How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them You see there are two	336.063720703125
853/3605	I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by the day after	36.09946060180664
854/3605	You are a jewel of a man	405.56646728515625
855/3605	These studs cannot be trusted to anybody it must be done in the	168.8671417236328
856/3605	Impossible my Lord There is no one but myself can so execute them that one cannot tell the new from the	474.50286865234375
857/3605	And if you wish ever to leave my palace you cannot so make the best of	141.0916290283203
858/3605	Name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must	345.8994445800781
859/3605	He knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to	597.439453125
860/3605	May I be permitted to inform my wife said	163.99264526367188
861/3605	Oh you may even see her if you like my dear	119.32778930664062
862/3605	Your captivity shall be mild be assured and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance I cause	388.7090148925781
863/3605	DArtagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus openhanded sported with men and	369.6241149902344
864/3605	As to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary	339.3501892089844
865/3605	Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a	296.97412109375
866/3605	Then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_	166.46621704101562
867/3605	We need not add that the goldsmith OReilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any	743.228759765625
868/3605	This point settled the duke turned to DArtagn	41.84368133544922
869/3605	Now my young friend said he England is all our	113.00959777832031
870/3605	What do you wish for What do you desire   A bed my Lord replied DArtagn	38.772705078125
871/3605	At present I confess that is the thing I stand most in need	150.69894409179688
872/3605	Buckingham gave DArtagnan a chamber adjoining his	664.9180908203125
873/3605	He wished to have the young man at handnot that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the	108.1149673461914
874/3605	In one hour after the ordinance was published in London that no vessel bound for France should leave port not even the packet boat with	1822.79833984375
875/3605	In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two	83.40016174316406
876/3605	Here said he to him are the diamond studs that you came to bring and be my witness that I have done all that human power could	171.6248321533203
877/3605	Be satisfied my Lord I will tell all that I have	84.76512145996094
878/3605	But does your Grace mean to give me the studs without the casket   The casket would encumber	331.2846984863281
879/3605	Besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to	134.68128967285156
880/3605	You will say that I keep	88.97217559814453
881/3605	I will perform your commission word for word my	757.61376953125
882/3605	And now resumed Buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you   DArtagnan blushed up to the whites of his	108.47400665283203
883/3605	He saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with English gold was strangely repugnant to	93.02217102050781
884/3605	Let us understand each other my Lord replied DArtagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no	66.09184265136719
885/3605	I am in the service of the King and Queen of France and form part of the company of Monsieur Dessessart who as well as his brotherinlaw Monsieur de Tréville is particularly attached to their Majest	100.65541076660156
886/3605	What I have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your	168.8440399169922
887/3605	And still further it is very probable I should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is	65.8144302368164
888/3605	Yes said the duke smiling and I even believe that I know that other person it is   My Lord I have not named her interrupted the young man warm	55.694786071777344
889/3605	That is true said the duke and it is to this person I am bound to discharge my debt of	74.25252532958984
890/3605	We say Proud as a Scotsman murmured the Duke of	569.31982421875
891/3605	And we say Proud as a Gascon replied DArtagn	46.09695816040039
892/3605	The Gascons are the Scots of	158.4684600830078
893/3605	DArtagnan bowed to the duke and was	32.31163024902344
894/3605	Well are you going away in that manner Where and how   Thats true   Fore Gad these Frenchmen have no consideration   I had forgotten that England was an island and that you were the king of	107.6248779296875
895/3605	Go to the riverside ask for the brig _Sund_ and give this letter to the captain he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by	293.44415283203125
896/3605	The name of that port  	223.11061096191406
897/3605	When you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a signa mere fishermans	229.9876251220703
898/3605	You cannot be mistaken there is but	36.203392028808594
899/3605	Afterward   You will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word Forward   Which means   In French _En avant	171.52755737304688
900/3605	He will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to	75.22482299804688
901/3605	You will find in the same way four relays on your	221.7313232421875
902/3605	If you will give at each of these relays your address in Paris the four horses will follow you th	196.00946044921875
903/3605	You already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a	231.65399169921875
904/3605	They were those we rode on and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to	152.02796936035156
905/3605	These horses are equipped for the	1199.174072265625
906/3605	However proud you may be you will not refuse to accept one of them and to request your three companions to accept the othersthat is in order to make war against	66.67131042480469
907/3605	Besides the end justified the means as you Frenchmen say does it not   Yes my Lord I accept them said DArtagnan and if it please God we will make a good use of your	92.72174072265625
908/3605	Perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends I	40.58610153198242
909/3605	Yes my Lord but with the hope of soon becoming	805.5359497070312
910/3605	I depend upon your word my	129.58511352539062
911/3605	DArtagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the rivers	44.607032775878906
912/3605	Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to	230.33201599121094
913/3605	Fifty vessels were waiting to set	3769.563720703125
914/3605	The next day about nine oclock in the morning he landed at	30.826641082763672
915/3605	DArtagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from	96.86695861816406
916/3605	War between England and France was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carous	542.4779052734375
917/3605	I want to know the route I am to follow said DArtagn	32.40985870361328
918/3605	Go from hence to Blangy and from Blangy to Neufchâ	2698.621826171875

920/3605	Have I anything to pay demanded DArtagn	141.8083953857422
921/3605	Everything is paid replied the host and liber	1486.4547119140625
922/3605	Begone and may God guide you   Amen cried the young man and set off at full gall	75.57544708251953
923/3605	Four hours later he was in Neufchâ	1176.65478515625
924/3605	He strictly followed the instructions he had	719.3978271484375
925/3605	Valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting	184.53968811035156
926/3605	He was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill but he found the holsters furnished with similar	130.32823181152344
927/3605	Your address at Paris   Hôtel of the Guards company of Dessess	2008.556640625
928/3605	Which route must I take demanded DArtagnan in his	106.9574966430664
929/3605	That of Rouen but you will leave the city on your	127.2562026977539
930/3605	You must stop at the little village of Eccuis in which there is but one tavernthe Shield of	904.29541015625
931/3605	Dont condemn it from appearances you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as	152.78880310058594
932/3605	Adieu master   A good journey gentlemen Do you want anything   DArtagnan shook his head and set off at full	34.816917419433594
933/3605	At Eccuis the same scene was	4743.06787109375

937/3605	He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve	125.00007629394531
938/3605	Eight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hôtel de Ville for this important	48.49605178833008

969/3605	The king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely	91.0107650756836
970/3605	Sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this I feared some accident might happen to	66.62342071533203
971/3605	If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself there	408.3968811035156

973/3605	The voice of the king was tremulous with	147.7417449951172
974/3605	Everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what	126.05449676513672
975/3605	Sire said the queen I can send for them to the Louvre where they are and thus your Majestys wishes will be complied	90.94646453857422

982/3605	The king came out first from his	127.39116668701172
983/3605	He was in a most elegant hunting costume and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like	267.5085144042969
984/3605	This was the costume that best became the	653.63134765625
985/3605	So dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his	797.4117431640625
986/3605	The cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small c	30.22776985168457
987/3605	The king opened it and found in it two diamond stud	441.2175598144531
988/3605	What does this mean demanded he of the	87.50228881835938
989/3605	Nothing replied the latter only if the queen has the studs which I very much doubt count them sire and if you only find ten ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are	425.9389343261719
990/3605	The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him but he had not time to address any question to hima cry of admiration burst from every	59.731300354003906
991/3605	If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in	82.37268829345703
992/3605	It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admir	166.29261779785156

994/3605	On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the pettico	499.7132873535156
995/3605	The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the stud	125.0073471069336
996/3605	The only question was had she ten or twelve   At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the	211.4964141845703
997/3605	The king advanced toward Madame the President with whom he was to dance and his Highness Monsieur with the	229.9824676513672
998/3605	They took their places and the ballet	74.12612915039062
999/3605	The king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the	156.82559204101562
1000/3605	A cold sweat covered the brow of the	129.88656616210938
1001/3605	The ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen _entrées	1617.1793212890625
1002/3605	The ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the	196.36936950683594
1003/3605	I thank you madame said he for the deference you have shown to my wishes but I think you want two of the studs and I bring them back to	44.612266540527344
1004/3605	With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given	89.53079223632812
1005/3605	How sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more I shall have	273.8560791015625
1006/3605	In fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her Majestys	579.712646484375
1007/3605	What does this mean Monsieur Cardinal asked the king in a severe	88.09870910644531
1008/3605	This means sire replied the cardinal that I was desirous of presenting her Majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself I adopted this means of inducing her to accept	146.92161560058594
1009/3605	And I am the more grateful to your Eminence replied Anne of Austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his	147.6034393310547
1010/3605	Then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her	49.15217590332031
1011/3605	The queen had just regained her chamber and DArtagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly	54.451717376708984
1012/3605	He turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow	33.15861892700195
1013/3605	The face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent M	257.3879089355469
1014/3605	On the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the Swiss guard Germain whither DArtagnan had sent for	55.73694610595703
1015/3605	The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few	209.38055419921875
1016/3605	Bonacieux moved by a double sentimentlove and	1165.2972412109375
1017/3605	At length after winding about for a minute or two M	1808.6046142578125
1018/3605	Bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led DArtagnan into	47.433467864990234
1019/3605	There she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapest	92.42510986328125
1020/3605	The opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she	633.6780395507812
1021/3605	The young man waited in comparative darkness and	1009.2445678710938
1022/3605	The queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of	127.67466735839844
1023/3605	Although DArtagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal	369.78399658203125
1024/3605	He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the	283.1792297363281
1025/3605	At length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapest	273.8226623535156
1026/3605	DArtagnan at once comprehended that this was his recomp	46.644203186035156
1027/3605	He cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his	33.469669342041016
1028/3605	Then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a	194.49644470214844
1029/3605	The door immediately closed and DArtagnan found himself again in complete	60.735721588134766
1030/3605	DArtagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet	46.85203170776367

1037/3605	Silence said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came   But where and when shall I see you again cried DArtagn	62.657352447509766
1038/3605	A note which you will find at home will tell	137.98809814453125

1045/3605	The reader may ask How came Planchet here when he was left stiff as a rush in	463.5795593261719
1046/3605	In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent him to Paris as he did the	462.8815612792969
1047/3605	Has anyone brought a letter for me asked DArtagnan	71.16963195800781

1049/3605	What do you mean blockhead   I mean to say that when I came in although I had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me I found a letter on the green table cover in your	68.61451721191406

1058/3605	While reading this letter DArtagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of	128.13917541503906
1059/3605	It was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted	60.48653793334961

1062/3605	Left alone DArtagnan read and reread his b	614.678955078125
1063/3605	Then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful	225.93333435058594
1064/3605	At length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden	400.9856262207031
1065/3605	At seven oclock in the morning he arose and called Planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding	53.89228820800781
1066/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan I am going out for all day	11.191549301147461

1072/3605	Ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps   Well if you are really afraid Monsieur Planchet resumed DArtagnan I will go without	98.4034194946289
1073/3605	I prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least	222.7978515625
1074/3605	Monsieur does me wrong said Planchet I thought he had seen me at	72.04450988769531

1080/3605	It appears that our journey was a remounting journey then   Exactly so said DArtagnan and nodding to Planchet he went	40.74363708496094
1081/3605	DArtagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with	250.5728759765625
1082/3605	Besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at	206.05126953125
1083/3605	Cloud opposite DEstréess pavilion DArtagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could	281.7771911621094
1084/3605	The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor	321.6327209472656
1085/3605	Bonacieux who was ignorant that DArtagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of Meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster	132.0478515625

1095/3605	A slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux but so slight that DArtagnan did not perceive	59.8670539855957
1096/3605	Ah may you be a true prophet said DArtagnan	28.97332763671875
1097/3605	No what I say replied Bonacieux is only that I may know whether I am delaying	171.76531982421875
1098/3605	Why that question my dear host asked DArtagn	61.1879768371582

1111/3605	Amuse yourself well replied Bonacieux in a sepulchral	81.06295013427734
1112/3605	But DArtagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked	57.48829650878906

1184/3605	As he passed the Hôtel des Gardes he took a glance into the st	58.987430572509766
1185/3605	Three of the four horses had already	105.00284576416016
1186/3605	Planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished	237.08090209960938
1187/3605	Ah monsieur said Planchet on perceiving DArtagnan how glad I am to see	16.15182113647461
1188/3605	Why so Planchet asked the young	34.70799255371094
1189/3605	Do you place confidence in our landlordMonsieur Bonacieux   I Not the least in the	179.3638458251953
1190/3605	And you found it   Traitorous monsie	117.18656921386719
1191/3605	Indeed   Still more as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite	62.86198043823242
1192/3605	It seems you are right Planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to	132.24925231933594
1193/3605	What would you have Planchet What must come is	264.0546569824219
1194/3605	Then that is Monsieurs determination   Undeniably my	759.1249389648438
1195/3605	At nine oclock then be ready here at the hôtel I will come and take	109.2628173828125
1196/3605	Planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third	110.92420196533203
1197/3605	As to DArtagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the Gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of	97.55303955078125
1198/3605	THE PAVILION     At nine oclock DArtagnan was at the Hôtel des Gardes he found Planchet all	121.6142578125
1199/3605	Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a	42.69154357910156
1200/3605	DArtagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed	73.28789520263672
1201/3605	It was quite dark and no one saw them go	59.804969787597656
1202/3605	Planchet took place behind his master and kept at a distance of ten paces from	23.643875122070312
1203/3605	DArtagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of La Conférence and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to	175.8494415283203
1204/3605	In fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneas	263.2173156738281
1205/3605	But why did you not dare to speak aloud Planchetbecause you are afraid   Afraid of being heard Yes monsie	48.02629470825195
1206/3605	Afraid of being heard Why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear Planchet and no one could find fault with	103.00907897949219
1207/3605	Ah monsieur replied Planchet recurring to his besetting idea that Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his	213.7812957763672
1208/3605	What the devil makes you think of Bonacieux   Monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we	41.31595993041992
1209/3605	Monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a	135.4083709716797
1210/3605	And you are very virtuous are you not Planchet   Monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder Had we not better lower our heads   In truth murmured DArtagnan to whom	81.99049377441406
1211/3605	de Trévilles recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me	2364.58837890625
1212/3605	And he put his horse into a tro	24.031417846679688
1213/3605	Planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his	39.56150817871094
1214/3605	Are we going to continue this pace all night asked Planc	111.83113861083984
1215/3605	No you are at your journeys	481.5343933105469
1216/3605	How monsieur And you   I am going a few steps	34.50260925292969
1217/3605	Well if you are cold Planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six oclock in the	47.56129455566406
1218/3605	Monsieur I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that I have not a sou left in case I should be	83.9962158203125
1219/3605	DArtagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to Planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around	27.0773983001709
1220/3605	Good Lord how cold I am cried Planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the	83.71141052246094
1221/3605	In the meantime DArtagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached	267.61492919921875
1222/3605	Cloud but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion	119.46623992919922
1223/3605	It was situated in a very private	191.2419891357422
1224/3605	A high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers	147.97320556640625
1225/3605	He gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he	226.93821716308594
1226/3605	Not the least noise was to be heard it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the	47.11812973022461
1227/3605	DArtagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind	55.25114059448242
1228/3605	The appointed hour was about to	188.94384765625
1229/3605	In fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of	63.92116165161133
1230/3605	Cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous	1064.5772705078125
1231/3605	There was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young	208.90504455566406
1232/3605	His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first	55.08538055419922
1233/3605	Through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the	276.6091003417969
1234/3605	There could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty M	1085.4991455078125
1235/3605	This time without knowing why DArtagnan felt a cold shiver run through his	50.82606887817383
1236/3605	Perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral	382.64666748046875
1237/3605	Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o	142.97003173828125
1238/3605	He drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o	40.8861198425293
1239/3605	He went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this	192.01255798339844
1240/3605	DArtagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to M	155.51473999023438
1241/3605	He clapped his hands three timesthe ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an	659.9434814453125
1242/3605	He then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for	70.43364715576172
1243/3605	He approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and DArtagnan could get no	115.08366394042969
1244/3605	At that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pav	121.39779663085938
1245/3605	Besides DArtagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy	116.92495727539062
1246/3605	In an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pav	111.08394622802734
1247/3605	It was a strange thing and one which made DArtagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful	224.0211181640625
1248/3605	One of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its	143.77154541015625
1249/3605	A table which had been covered with an elegant supper was	241.8121337890625
1250/3605	The decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the	716.929443359375
1251/3605	Everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate	431.6300354003906
1252/3605	DArtagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the	691.1400756835938
1253/3605	He hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of	74.77250671386719
1254/3605	The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the	120.39794921875
1255/3605	DArtagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarkedfor nothing had led him to the examinationthat the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and	353.7654724121094
1256/3605	Besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from Paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward	84.568115234375
1257/3605	At length DArtagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a womans torn	206.1089630126953
1258/3605	This glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable	1475.73046875
1259/3605	It was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty	306.5148010253906
1260/3605	As DArtagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and	366.3954772949219
1261/3605	And yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with M	344.5195007324219
1262/3605	Bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in Paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her	56.6558837890625
1263/3605	But all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over	523.7847290039062
1264/3605	He ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boat	312.1668701171875
1265/3605	There were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to	204.1282501220703
1266/3605	Cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet DArtagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was M	58.16059875488281
1267/3605	DArtagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of M	84.03031158447266
1268/3605	Bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at	139.87440490722656
1269/3605	Cloud and not elsewhere before the DEstréess pavilion and not in another	2123.162841796875
1270/3605	Everything conspired to prove to DArtagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had	36.30838394165039
1271/3605	He again ran back to the châte	58.94109344482422
1272/3605	It appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited	75.99337005615234
1273/3605	The lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the	178.4114532470703
1274/3605	DArtagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its	240.8204803466797
1275/3605	The gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chainedup dog went up to the	161.09996032714844
1276/3605	No one answered to his first	975.2220458984375
1277/3605	A silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked	134.20196533203125
1278/3605	It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise withina timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be	99.43450927734375
1279/3605	Then DArtagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most	169.62161254882812
1280/3605	At length an old wormeaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of DArtagn	355.69970703125
1281/3605	Nevertheless rapid as the movement had been DArtagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old	40.13253402709961
1282/3605	In the name of heaven cried he listen to me I have been waiting for someone who has not	39.54854202270508
1283/3605	Has anything particular happened in the neighborhood Speak   The window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than	131.86802673339844
1284/3605	DArtagnan related his story simply with the omission of	344.7919921875
1285/3605	He told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the	116.98674774169922
1286/3605	The old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when DArtagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing	74.45109558105469
1287/3605	In the name of heaven explain yourself   Oh Monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if I dared tell you what I have seen certainly no good would befall	79.50176239013672
1288/3605	You have then seen something replied DArtagn	87.50629425048828
1289/3605	In that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my	68.61128234863281
1290/3605	As I am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed I went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from	47.93855285644531
1291/3605	In the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddleh	137.6240692138672
1292/3605	These horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as caval	171.34051513671875
1293/3605	Ah my worthy gentlemen cried I what do you want You must have a ladder said he who appeared to be the leader of the	86.66287231445312
1294/3605	Yes monsieur the one with which I gather my	132.40005493164062
1295/3605	Lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused	121.63908386230469
1296/3605	Only remember thisif you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen I am quite sure however we may threaten you you are	129.93817138671875
1297/3605	At these words he threw me a crown which I picked up and he took the	102.03746032714844
1298/3605	After shutting the gate behind them I pretended to return to the house but I immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge I gained yonder clump of elder from which I could hear and see	162.4982452392578
1299/3605	The little old man remained at the coach door the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the saddleh	74.83938598632812
1300/3605	All at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the	45.86616897583008
1301/3605	Then I saw no more but I heard the noise of breaking	93.46228790283203
1302/3605	The woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon st	391.1497497558594
1303/3605	Two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after	136.0074005126953
1304/3605	The leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the	104.36390686035156
1305/3605	His two companions were already on horse	66.27070617675781
1306/3605	He sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was	58.34303283691406
1307/3605	From that moment I have neither seen nor heard	40.59862518310547
1308/3605	DArtagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his	167.18142700195312
1309/3605	But my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and thats a	201.82823181152344
1310/3605	Can you guess said DArtagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition   I dont know	36.96253204345703
1311/3605	But as you spoke to him you must have seen	20.079198837280273
1312/3605	Oh its a description you want   Exactly	265.0179748535156
1313/3605	A tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a	560.4027709960938
1314/3605	Thats the man cried DArtagnan again he forever he He is my demon	548.4915161132812
1315/3605	And the other   Which   The short	77.67247009277344
1316/3605	Oh he was not a gentleman Ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small	146.5247802734375
1317/3605	Poor woman poor woman what have they done with you   You have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old	43.84861373901367
1318/3605	A gentleman has but his word and I have given you	122.56143188476562
1319/3605	With a heavy heart DArtagnan again bent his way toward the	71.82991790771484
1320/3605	Sometimes he hoped it could not be M	320.3056335449219
1321/3605	Bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the Louvre sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her	171.13172912597656
1322/3605	His mind was torn by doubt grief and	535.4725952148438
1323/3605	Oh if I had my three friends here cried he I should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them   It was past midnight the next thing was to find Planc	67.4133529663086
1324/3605	DArtagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find Planchet in any of	77.20293426513672
1325/3605	At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather	455.2513122558594
1326/3605	DArtagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was	34.69469451904297
1327/3605	Besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious	97.41474914550781
1328/3605	He was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or	161.99769592285156
1329/3605	DArtagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest	755.8982543945312
1330/3605	Toward six oclock DArtagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad	376.2235107421875
1331/3605	He was not long in making his	193.16073608398438
1332/3605	The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest Planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which DArtagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its	144.92837524414062
1333/3605	PORTHOS     Instead of returning directly home DArtagnan alighted at the door of	75.63575744628906
1334/3605	de Tréville and ran quickly up the	83.37940979003906
1335/3605	This time he had decided to relate all that had	106.27417755126953
1336/3605	de Tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole	60.286415100097656
1337/3605	de Tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her	174.91062927246094
1338/3605	de Tréville listened to the young mans account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love	139.60659790039062
1339/3605	When DArtagnan had finished he said Hum All this savors of his Eminence a league	168.7266082763672
1340/3605	But what is to be done said DArtagn	8.851821899414062
1341/3605	Nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting Paris as I told you as soon as	174.61729431152344
1342/3605	I will see the queen I will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt	50.41910171508789
1343/3605	These details will guide her on her part and on your return I shall perhaps have some good news to tell	138.69374084472656
1344/3605	DArtagnan knew that although a Gascon	54.04356002807617
1345/3605	de Tréville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his	120.48668670654297
1346/3605	He bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant	110.73786163330078
1347/3605	Determined to put the advice of	68.38910675048828
1348/3605	de Tréville in practice instantly DArtagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his val	84.2725601196289
1349/3605	On approaching the house he perceived	278.9451904296875
1350/3605	Bonacieux in morning costume standing at his	669.2310180664062
1351/3605	All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of DArtagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done	31.879318237304688
1352/3605	In fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental DArtagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his count	438.63360595703125
1353/3605	A rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good	127.11962127685547
1354/3605	All falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true	389.1658020019531
1355/3605	It appeared then to DArtagnan that	47.8936653137207
1356/3605	Bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look	268.6843566894531
1357/3605	In consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before	36.292518615722656
1358/3605	Well young man said he we appear to pass rather gay nights Seven oclock in the morning _Peste_ You seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going	215.5159454345703
1359/3605	No one can reproach you for anything of the kind Monsieur Bonacieux said the young man you are a model for regular	75.72041320800781
1360/3605	It is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness	85.65702056884766
1361/3605	Happiness comes to meet him does it not Monsieur Bonacieux   Bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly	150.4628448486328
1362/3605	Ah ah said Bonacieux you are a jocular companion But where the devil were you gadding last night my young master It does not appear to be very clean in the cross	284.12005615234375
1363/3605	DArtagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud	303.76873779296875
1364/3605	Both were stained with splashes of mud of the same	1487.2147216796875
1365/3605	Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of DArtagn	21.490612030029297
1366/3605	That little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was Bonacieux	1080.6966552734375
1367/3605	The husband had presided at the abduction of his	206.00833129882812
1368/3605	A terrible inclination seized DArtagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained	123.2984848022461
1369/3605	Ah but you are joking my worthy man said DArtagn	24.566387176513672
1370/3605	It appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a	1179.3892822265625
1371/3605	May you not have been philandering a little also Monsieur Bonacieux Oh the devil Thats unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as	288.43499755859375
1372/3605	Oh Lord no said Bonacieux but yesterday I went to	423.4345703125
1373/3605	Mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as I cannot possibly do without one and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud which I have not yet had time to	169.0700225830078
1374/3605	The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions DArtagnan had	130.67926025390625
1375/3605	Bonacieux had named Mandé because Mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from	1789.3690185546875
1376/3605	This probability afforded him his first	2250.4111328125
1377/3605	If Bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret	621.6690063476562
1378/3605	The question then was how to change this probability into a	1395.1077880859375
1379/3605	Pardon my dear Monsieur Bonacieux if I dont stand upon ceremony said DArtagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of	113.29950714111328
1380/3605	Allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment you know that is never refused among	109.66263580322266
1381/3605	Without waiting for the permission of his host DArtagnan went quickly into the house and cast a rapid glance at the	34.245208740234375
1382/3605	He had only been back an hour or two he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first	164.18536376953125
1383/3605	Thanks Monsieur Bonacieux said DArtagnan emptying his glass that is all I wanted of	32.82793426513672
1384/3605	I will now go up into my	50.126461029052734
1385/3605	I will make Planchet brush my boots and when he has done I will if you like send him to you to brush your	182.4755096435547
1386/3605	He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsider	343.40863037109375
1387/3605	At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great	32.904571533203125
1388/3605	Ah monsieur cried Planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more	50.54579162597656
1389/3605	I thought you would never come	64.70561218261719
1390/3605	Whats the matter now Planchet demanded DArtagn	67.19812774658203
1391/3605	Oh I give you a hundred I give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit I received in your	39.493003845214844
1392/3605	When   About half an hour ago while you were at Monsieur de Trév	52.92275619506836
1393/3605	Monsieur de Cavois   In	239.31297302246094
1394/3605	The captain of the cardinals Guards  	272.1183166503906
1395/3605	Did he come to arrest me   I have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling	58.96929168701172
1396/3605	Was he so sweet then   Indeed he was all honey monsie	156.9240264892578
1397/3605	Indeed   He came he said on the part of his Eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the Palais	84.4689712524414
1398/3605	It was called the PalaisCardinal before Richelieu gave it to the	605.8413696289062
1399/3605	What did you answer him   That the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could	47.58135986328125
1400/3605	The snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal replied the young man	250.2434539794922
1401/3605	Oh I saw the snare and I answered you would be quite in despair on your	76.27046203613281
1402/3605	Where has he gone asked Monsieur de Cav	435.91693115234375
1403/3605	And when did he set out   Yesterday	75.09791564941406
1404/3605	Planchet my friend interrupted DArtagnan you are really a precious	13.627408981323242
1405/3605	You will understand monsieur I thought there would be still time if you wish to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet	61.73396301269531
1406/3605	The falsehood would then lie at my door and as I am not a gentleman I may be allowed to	104.08673858642578
1407/3605	Be of good heart Planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious	342.602783203125
1408/3605	In a quarter of an hour we set	11.864413261413574
1409/3605	Thats the advice I was about to give Monsieur and where are we going may I ask without being too curious   _Pardieu_ In the opposite direction to that which you said I was	64.48009490966797
1410/3605	Indeed I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of	343.1576843261719
1411/3605	So then   So then pack up our luggage Planchet and let us be	103.99803924560547
1412/3605	On my part I will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be	47.532249450683594
1413/3605	You may join me at the Hôtel des Gard	63.464927673339844
1414/3605	By the way Planchet I think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low w	110.33190155029297
1415/3605	Ah monsieur you may take my word when I tell you	21.529836654663086
1416/3605	I am a physiognomist I assure	27.754728317260742
1417/3605	DArtagnan went out first as had been agreed	34.17245864868164
1418/3605	Then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three	48.396148681640625
1419/3605	No news had been received of them only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for Aram	472.3147888183594
1420/3605	Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the Hôtel des Gard	33.0914192199707
1421/3605	DArtagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse	35.982643127441406
1422/3605	Thats well said he to Planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the	88.61064147949219
1423/3605	Do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece said Planchet with his shrewd	86.2544937133789
1424/3605	No Monsieur Jester replied DArtagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them	71.51150512695312
1425/3605	Which is a great chance replied Planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of	58.81279373168945
1426/3605	Amen said DArtagnan getting into his	47.86437225341797
1427/3605	As they went from the Hôtel des Gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit Paris by the Barrière de la Villette and the other by the Barrière Montmartre to meet again beyond	72.7296371459961
1428/3605	Denisa strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate	1167.2230224609375
1429/3605	Planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by	97.68681335449219
1430/3605	His natural prudence however never forsook him for a single	188.99583435058594
1431/3605	He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an	150.31297302246094
1432/3605	It followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from DArtagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no	123.70411682128906
1433/3605	Nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of Great	155.0116729736328
1434/3605	Martin the same at which they had stopped on their first	69.61317443847656
1435/3605	The host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the	103.71411895751953
1436/3605	Now as they had already traveled eleven leagues DArtagnan thought it time to stop whether Porthos were or were not in the	90.82183074951172
1437/3605	Perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the Musket	41.041072845458984
1438/3605	DArtagnan was therefore served with miraculous cel	161.22438049316406
1439/3605	The regiment of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and DArtagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a	165.8270263671875
1440/3605	The host desired himself to serve him which DArtagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following	151.5975341796875
1441/3605	Take your glass then and let us	80.80210876464844
1442/3605	But what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility Let us drink to the prosperity of your	317.6087951660156
1443/3605	Your Lordship does me much honor said the host and I thank you sincerely for your kind	289.3133850097656
1444/3605	But dont mistake said DArtagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may thinkfor it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well	217.20358276367188
1445/3605	In hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his	1341.8046875
1446/3605	Now I travel a great deal particularly on this road and I wish to see all innkeepers making a	175.6849822998047
1447/3605	It seems to me said the host that this is not the first time I have had the honor of seeing Monsie	9.41644287109375
1448/3605	Bah I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly and out of the ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at	67.5640869140625
1449/3605	Why I was here only ten or twelve days	61.465049743652344
1450/3605	I was conducting some friends Musketeers one of whom by the by had a dispute with a strangera man who sought a quarrel with him for I dont know	148.34693908691406
1451/3605	Exactly so said the host I remember it	76.624267578125
1452/3605	It is not Monsieur Porthos that your Lordship means   Yes that is my companions	85.04175567626953
1453/3605	My God my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him   Your Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his	76.24893951416016
1454/3605	Why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of	32.232242584228516
1455/3605	He has done us the honor to remain	38.525630950927734
1456/3605	What he had done you the honor to remain here   Yes monsieur in this house and we are even a little uneasy   On what account   Of certain expenses he has	48.224849700927734
1457/3605	Well but whatever expenses he may have incurred I am sure he is in a condition to pay	196.26535034179688
1458/3605	Ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my	1207.57177734375
1459/3605	We have made considerable advances and this very morning the surgeon declared that if Monsieur Porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was I who had sent for	51.07307052612305
1460/3605	Porthos is wounded then   I cannot tell you monsie	19.885568618774414
1461/3605	What You cannot tell me Surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other	43.86904525756836
1462/3605	Yes but in our situation we must not say all we knowparticularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our	189.65902709960938
1463/3605	Well can I see Porthos   Certainly monsie	18.271881103515625
1464/3605	Take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at Number	645.2970581054688
1465/3605	Only warn him that it is	57.51313781738281
1466/3605	Why should I do that   Because monsieur some mischief might happen to	45.3641471862793
1467/3605	Of what kind in the name of wonder   Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your	79.03197479248047
1468/3605	What have you done to him then   We have asked him for	49.863670349121094
1469/3605	The devil Ah I can understand	134.1902618408203
1470/3605	It is a demand that Porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but I know he must be so at	101.15875244140625
1471/3605	As our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the	176.23397827148438
1472/3605	It is true he had been playing the day	94.12385559082031
1473/3605	Playing the day before And with whom   Lord who can say monsieur With some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet	159.5868682861328
1474/3605	When we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to	175.4499969482422
1475/3605	We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentlemans word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be	60.83714294433594
1476/3605	This reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his	113.82488250732422
1477/3605	Since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his	125.68477630615234
1478/3605	What Mousqueton is here then   Oh yes monsie	11.496258735656738
1479/3605	Five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition	136.2825927734375
1480/3605	It appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his	800.02099609375
1481/3605	Unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at	153.6530303955078
1482/3605	The fact is said DArtagnan I have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in Mousqu	35.34904479980469
1483/3605	That is possible monsieur but suppose I should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy I should be a ruined man   No for Porthos will pay	74.71089172363281
1484/3605	Hum said the host in a doubtful	64.14490509033203
1485/3605	The favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes	92.27978515625
1486/3605	If I durst say what I believe on that head   What you believe   I ought rather to say what I	64.9311752319336
1487/3605	What you know   And even what I am sure	33.55278015136719
1488/3605	And of what are you so sure   I would say that I know this great	48.86789321899414
1489/3605	And how do you know her   Oh monsieur if I could believe I might trust in your	44.126678466796875
1490/3605	Speak By the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your	126.38521575927734
1491/3605	Well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many	38.89387893676758
1492/3605	What have you done   Oh nothing which was not right in the character of a	52.43209457397461
1493/3605	Well   Monsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the	37.38408660888672
1494/3605	As he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this	103.36165618896484
1495/3605	And then   Instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe I took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess	65.32552337646484
1496/3605	This was fulfilling the intentions of Monsieur Porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not   Nearly	38.331871032714844
1497/3605	Well monsieur do you know who this great lady is   No I have heard Porthos speak of her thats	34.55419921875
1498/3605	Do you know who this pretended duchess is   I repeat to you I dont know	39.999141693115234
1499/3605	Why she is the old wife of a procurator of the Châtelet monsieur named Madame Coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous	374.8223571777344
1500/3605	It struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the Rue aux O	531.748046875
1501/3605	Has he been wounded then   Oh good Lord What have I said   You said that Porthos had received a sword	105.82452392578125
1502/3605	Yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say	83.43608093261719
1503/3605	Zounds monsieur Because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his	325.27618408203125
1504/3605	As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his	101.96654510498047
1505/3605	It is a wound that confines him to his bed   Ah and a master stroke too I assure	381.0015563964844
1506/3605	Your friends soul must stick tight to his	10473.9365234375
1507/3605	Were you there then   Monsieur I followed them from curiosity so that I saw the combat without the combatants seeing	153.40106201171875
1508/3605	And what took place   Oh The affair was not long I assure	100.97591400146484
1509/3605	They placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when Monsieur Porthos came to the _parade_ he had already three inches of steel in his	93.77307891845703
1510/3605	The stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and Monsieur Porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself	75.34081268310547
1511/3605	Upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was Porthos and not DArtagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and	76.79798889160156
1512/3605	So it was with Monsieur dArtagnan this stranger meant to quarrel   It appears	41.01728439331055
1513/3605	And do you know what has become of him   No I never saw him until that moment and have not seen him	17.43617820739746
1514/3605	Very well I know all that I wish to	27.469833374023438
1515/3605	Porthoss chamber is you say on the first story Number One   Yes monsieur the handsomest in the inna chamber that I could have let ten times	204.59716796875
1516/3605	Bah Be satisfied said DArtagnan laughing Porthos will pay you with the money of the Duchess Coquen	124.04524230957031
1517/3605	And did you convey this answer to your guest   We took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his	150.2999267578125
1518/3605	So that he still expects his money   Oh Lord yes monsieur Yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the	97.6513671875
1519/3605	Do you say the procurators wife is old and ugly   Fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to Pathauds	793.9981689453125
1520/3605	In that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be	95.0867919921875
1521/3605	How not much Twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the	1488.913330078125
1522/3605	He denies himself nothing it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live	368.4916687011719
1523/3605	Never mind if his mistress abandons him he will find friends I will answer for	234.61386108398438
1524/3605	So my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation	162.32919311523438
1525/3605	Monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurators wife and not to say a word of the wound   Thats agreed you have my	126.72176361083984
1526/3605	Oh he would kill me   Dont be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he	34.193050384521484
1527/3605	Saying these words DArtagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interestedhis debt and his	121.92042541503906
1528/3605	At the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number	326.1790771484375
1529/3605	DArtagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the	166.92739868164062
1530/3605	In addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty	227.6110076904297
1531/3605	At the sight of his friend Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy and Mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular	96.80028533935547
1532/3605	Ah _pardieu_ Is that you said Porthos to DArtagn	15.763593673706055
1533/3605	Excuse my not coming to meet you but added he looking at DArtagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me  	21.42752456665039
1534/3605	Has the host told you nothing then   I asked after you and came up as soon as I	69.97579956054688
1535/3605	And what has happened to you my dear Porthos continued DArtagn	8.932746887207031
1536/3605	Why on making a thrust at my adversary whom I had already hit three times and whom I meant to finish with the fourth I put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my	214.72119140625
1537/3605	Truly   Honor Luckily for the rascal for I should have left him dead on the spot I assure	261.3054504394531
1538/3605	And what has became of him   Oh I dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the	60.38529968261719
1539/3605	But you my dear DArtagnan what has happened to you   So that this strain of the knee continued DArtagnan my dear Porthos keeps you in bed   My God thats	27.097135543823242
1540/3605	I shall be about again in a few	48.845340728759766
1541/3605	Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris You must be cruelly bored	127.88439178466797
1542/3605	That was my intention but my dear friend I have one thing to confess to	37.923221588134766
1543/3605	He accepted my challenge and my faith my seventyfive pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the	307.8587341308594
1544/3605	But you my dear DArtagnan   What can you expect my dear Porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said DArtagn	19.726957321166992
1545/3605	You know the proverb Unlucky at play lucky in	10199.44140625
1546/3605	You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its	220.4476776123047
1547/3605	I wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which I stood absolutely in need on account of my	174.79208374023438
1548/3605	Well   Well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered	85.69779968261719
1549/3605	Truly   No so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the	427.2481384277344
1550/3605	But you are here my dear fellow let us speak of	22.900054931640625
1551/3605	I confess I began to be very uneasy on your	64.62858581542969
1552/3605	But your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear Porthos said DArtagnan directing the sick mans attention to the full stewpans and the empty	221.0786590576172
1553/3605	So you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position I am armed to the	218.7747039794922
1554/3605	And yet said DArtagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties	52.834190368652344
1555/3605	And he again pointed to the bottles and the stewp	580.2860107421875
1556/3605	This miserable strain confines me to my bed but Mousqueton forages and brings in	2635.9638671875
1557/3605	Friend Mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of	103.75364685058594
1558/3605	Mousqueton said DArtagnan you must render me a	14.538675308227539
1559/3605	What monsieur   You must give your recipe to Planc	27.42551040649414
1560/3605	I may be besieged in my turn and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your	36.1011848449707
1561/3605	Lord monsieur There is nothing more easy said Mousqueton with a modest	28.74989891052246
1562/3605	One only needs to be sharp thats	891.9995727539062
1563/3605	I was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a po	284.5441589355469
1564/3605	And what did he do the rest of his time   Monsieur he carried on a trade which I have always thought	105.44463348388672
1565/3605	Now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a Catholic coming alone the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in his	480.9432373046875
1566/3605	He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the travelers abandoning his purse to save his	123.21021270751953
1567/3605	It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy	163.23875427246094
1568/3605	For my part monsieur I am Catholicmy father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a Huguen	605.28173828125
1569/3605	And what was the end of this worthy man asked DArtagn	18.51210594177246
1570/3605	Oh of the most unfortunate kind monsie	79.22784423828125
1571/3605	One day he was surprised in a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a	456.40789794921875
1572/3605	Then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and I were	289.8812255859375
1573/3605	And what did you do said DArtagn	10.313298225402832
1574/3605	We let them tell their story out replied Mousqu	143.74610900878906
1575/3605	Then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the Catholic and I on that of the Huguen	333.9952392578125
1576/3605	Two hours after all was over we had done the business of both admiring the foresight of our poor father who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different	95.64990234375
1577/3605	Well I must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent	66.34381103515625
1578/3605	And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher   Yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a	98.7735366821289
1579/3605	The consequence is that when I saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours I had recourse to a little of my old	415.6199645996094
1580/3605	While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince I laid a few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his Highnesss pieces of water I slipped a few lines into his fish	249.4986572265625
1581/3605	So that now thanks be to God we do not want as Monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eelsall light wholesome food suitable for the	1288.3204345703125
1582/3605	But the wine said DArtagnan who furnishes the wine Your host   That is to say yes and	73.46202850341797
1583/3605	How yes and no   He furnishes it it is true but he does not know that he has that	48.00823211669922
1584/3605	Explain yourself Mousqueton your conversation is full of instructive	511.4629211425781
1585/3605	It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in my peregrinations who had seen many countries and among them the New	751.0665893554688
1586/3605	What connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   Patience monsieur everything will come in its	284.07916259765625
1587/3605	This Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in his voyage to	141.2576904296875
1588/3605	This lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between	1959.9517822265625
1589/3605	My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running no	200.7100372314453
1590/3605	I practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the	283.7149963378906
1591/3605	Well do you understand monsieur Our host has a wellfurnished cellar the key of which never leaves him only this cellar has a ventilating	791.8414916992188
1592/3605	Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso and as I now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine thats my point for	645.0374755859375
1593/3605	You see monsieur what the New World has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the	325.14251708984375
1594/3605	Now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it   Thank you my friend thank you unfortunately I have just breakfast	128.9225616455078
1595/3605	Well said Porthos arrange the table Mousqueton and while we breakfast DArtagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left	55.17258071899414
1596/3605	But there the confidence of DArtagnan	61.24262237548828
1597/3605	He only added that on his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent horsesone for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the	99.21228790283203
1598/3605	At this moment Planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at Clerm	60.78367233276367
1599/3605	For the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if Porthos were still at the Great	118.4869384765625

1630/3605	DArtagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our oldfashioned tavern	138.97450256347656

1638/3605	It may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of DArtagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him	108.83657836914062

1675/3605	Exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying	148.09185791015625

1688/3605	DArtagnan thought it was proper to follow this	40.76426315307617
1689/3605	The Pope is the successor of	148.51856994628906

1913/3605	Without reckoning monsieur added Planchet to his masters audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to	248.7037811279297
1914/3605	Do you remember how he cried On DArtagnan on I am taken And when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword One might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were	221.83738708496094
1915/3605	These words redoubled the eagerness of DArtagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid	99.8172607421875
1916/3605	About eleven oclock in the morning they perceived Amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed	52.32901382446289
1917/3605	DArtagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped	356.8305969238281
1918/3605	He entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right	105.91620635986328
1919/3605	Do you remember me said he to the host who advanced to greet	71.35043334960938
1920/3605	I have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which DArtagnan	63.73741912841797
1921/3605	What you dont know me   No monseign	21.073646545410156
1922/3605	Well two words will refresh your	475.16607666015625
1923/3605	Ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice	103.08174896240234
1924/3605	Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his arm	151.88949584960938
1925/3605	Here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for I now recollect	203.7863006591797
1926/3605	It was you who rode off at the moment I had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak	112.85784912109375
1927/3605	Yes it was I so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole	50.87636947631836
1928/3605	Condescend to listen to me and you shall know	238.30270385742188
1929/3605	I had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as Guards or Musket	551.6637573242188
1930/3605	Monseigneur I was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenancesnothing was	288.90948486328125
1931/3605	Go on go on said DArtagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had	103.82575225830078
1932/3605	I took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as I thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coin	211.4512176513672
1933/3605	Again said DArtagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word _coiners	1209.9700927734375
1934/3605	Pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my	211.5958709716797
1935/3605	The authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the	122.07353973388672
1936/3605	But once again that gentlemanwhere is he What has become of him Is he dead Is he living   Patience monseigneur we are coming to	65.59483337402344
1937/3605	There happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape DArtagnan appeared to authorize the	129.4517059326172
1938/3605	That gentleman your friend defended himself	9836.1904296875
1939/3605	Alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon	49.557640075683594
1940/3605	As we were sure of finding him there we left him	114.36898803710938
1941/3605	Yes said DArtagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison	33.093017578125
1942/3605	Good God To imprison him monseigneur Why he imprisoned himself I swear to you he	205.5725555419922
1943/3605	In the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely	179.10693359375
1944/3605	The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and I have heard nothing of either of them	68.71775817871094
1945/3605	As for myself as soon as I recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor to whom I related all that had passed and asked what I should do with my	99.08416748046875
1946/3605	He told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders I had received did not come from him and that if I had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me	61.282318115234375
1947/3605	It appears that I had made a mistake monsieur that I had arrested the wrong person and that he whom I ought to have arrested had	38.69482421875
1948/3605	Ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil To my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own	64.66795349121094
1949/3605	I told him very humblyfor I could not conceal from myself the scrape I had got into by laying hands on one of his Majestys MusketeersI told him I was quite ready to submit to his	226.6744384765625
1950/3605	In the first place said he I wish my lackey placed with me fully	153.84181213378906
1951/3605	We hastened to obey this order for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could	98.48731231689453
1952/3605	But where is Athos now cried DArtagn	28.76041603088379
1953/3605	Where is Athos   In the cellar monsie	24.543588638305664
1954/3605	What you scoundrel Have you kept him in the cellar all this time   Merciful heaven No monsieur We keep him in the cellar You do not know what he is about in the	78.05091094970703
1955/3605	We every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it but alas It is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest	256.427734375
1956/3605	I once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible	172.86553955078125
1957/3605	I heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musket	294.2293701171875
1958/3605	Then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the	127.69775390625
1959/3605	Upon this I went and complained to the governor who replied that I only had what I deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my	175.87969970703125
1960/3605	So that since that time replied DArtagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the	112.12507629394531
1961/3605	So from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the	81.73407745361328
1962/3605	There is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and saus	858.32958984375
1963/3605	And as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to	156.0467529296875
1964/3605	If your friend remains another week in my cellar I shall be a ruined	132.38609313964844
1965/3605	And not more than justice either you ass Could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coinerssay   Yes monsieur you are right said the	267.78607177734375
1966/3605	But hark hark There he is   Somebody has disturbed him without doubt said DArtagn	168.2859649658203
1967/3605	But he must be disturbed cried the host Here are two English gentlemen just	293.58648681640625
1968/3605	Well   Well the English like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the	92.74270629882812
1969/3605	My wife has perhaps requested permission of Monsieur Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has	147.0669708251953
1970/3605	Ah good heaven There is the hullabaloo louder than ever   DArtagnan in fact heard a great noise on the side next the	407.9577941894531
1971/3605	He rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by Planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of	80.70480346679688
1972/3605	The two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and	171.4658203125
1973/3605	One might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogresthe gigantic heroes of popular legends into whose cavern nobody could force their way with	1116.511962890625
1974/3605	There was a moment of silence but at length the two Englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a	207.82704162597656
1975/3605	Planchet said DArtagnan cocking his pistols I will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one	37.65427780151367
1976/3605	Ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have	229.43402099609375
1977/3605	Good God cried the hollow voice of Athos I can hear DArtagnan I	61.37794876098633
1978/3605	Yes cried DArtagnan raising his voice in turn I am here my	21.068450927734375
1979/3605	Ah good then replied Athos we will teach them these door breakers   The gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two	219.10523986816406
1980/3605	They still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to	1533.41455078125
1981/3605	Stand on one side DArtagnan stand on one side cried Ath	22.78713607788086
1982/3605	I am going to fire   Gentlemen exclaimed DArtagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are	82.76561737060547
1983/3605	Patience Athos You are running your heads into a very silly affair you will be	658.6161499023438
1984/3605	My lackey and I will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the	108.54660034179688
1985/3605	You will then have our swords with which I can assure you my friend and I can play tolerably	61.91328430175781
1986/3605	Let me conduct your business and my	266.20880126953125
1987/3605	You shall soon have something to drink I give you my	73.85816192626953
1988/3605	If there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of Ath	459.7180480957031
1989/3605	The host felt a cold sweat creep down his	347.72894287109375
1990/3605	How If there is any left murmured	237.86016845703125
1991/3605	What the devil There must be plenty left replied DArtagn	79.82947540283203
1992/3605	Be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the	871.887451171875
1993/3605	Gentlemen return your swords to their scabb	1079.3580322265625
1994/3605	Well provided you replace your pistols in your	263.4009704589844
1995/3605	Then turning toward Planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musket	228.9349365234375
1996/3605	The Englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumbling	852.7520751953125
1997/3605	The history of Athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the	169.56394958496094
1998/3605	Now gentlemen said DArtagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes I will answer for it you shall have all you	34.294673919677734
1999/3605	Now I am alone my dear Athos said DArtagnan open the door I beg of	16.909154891967773
2000/3605	Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos which the besieged himself	713.9522094726562
2001/3605	An instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of Athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the	79.73912048339844
2002/3605	DArtagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tender	23.562198638916016
2003/3605	He then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that Athos	99.20822143554688
2004/3605	I am dead drunk thats all and never did a man more strongly set about getting	501.7275085449219
2005/3605	By the Lord my good host I must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty	178.1695098876953
2006/3605	Mercy cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master I am a ruined	109.86235809326172
2007/3605	He would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the c	112.75887298583984
2008/3605	Hark I dont think he put the faucet in	2033.306884765625
2009/3605	Do you hear it It is running	419.5553894042969
2010/3605	DArtagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning	89.10824584960938
2011/3605	In the meantime Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head	64.30393981933594
2012/3605	Like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of Rub	2039.53125
2013/3605	He was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive	609.0733642578125
2014/3605	The four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which DArtagnan occupied with	116.99282836914062
2015/3605	In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited	110.91632080078125
2016/3605	The image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of	289.11767578125
2017/3605	Of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten	3460.571533203125
2018/3605	Then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the	91.83506774902344
2019/3605	Athos did not even turn his	69.05586242675781
2020/3605	The host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two	126.21165466308594
2021/3605	Some wine said Athos on perceiving the	54.57330322265625
2022/3605	Some wine cried the stupefied host some wine Why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth I am a ruined man lost destroyed   Bah said Athos we were always	154.8306121826172
2023/3605	If you had been contented with drinking well and good but you have broken all the	193.1638641357422
2024/3605	You pushed me upon a heap which rolled	471.9203796386719
2025/3605	All my oil is lost   Oil is a sovereign balm for wounds and my poor Grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on	748.5509643554688
2026/3605	All my sausages are gnawed   There is an enormous quantity of rats in that	210.0107879638672
2027/3605	You shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated	372.78912353515625
2028/3605	Triple ass said Athos rising but he sank down again	449.4159240722656
2029/3605	He had tried his strength to the	211.41342163085938
2030/3605	DArtagnan came to his relief with his whip in his	39.48133850097656
2031/3605	The host drew back and burst into	182.92137145996094
2032/3605	This will teach you said DArtagnan to treat the guests God sends you in a more courteous	93.95389556884766
2033/3605	God Say the devil   My dear friend said DArtagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you	48.203895568847656
2034/3605	Oh gentlemen said the host I have been	57.50748825073242
2035/3605	I confess it but pardon to every sin You are gentlemen and I am a poor inn	205.83670043945312
2036/3605	Ah if you speak in that way said Athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the c	64.23535919189453
2037/3605	We are not such devils as we appear to	144.0733642578125
2038/3605	Come hither I say and dont be afraid continued Ath	116.39077758789062
2039/3605	At the very moment when I was about to pay you I had placed my purse on the	28.983774185180664
2040/3605	That purse contained sixty pistoles where is it   Deposited with the justice they said it was bad	662.4404296875
2041/3605	Very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pist	295.40374755859375
2042/3605	But Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold	501.16558837890625
2043/3605	If it were bad money there might be some hopes but unfortunately those were all good	407.24993896484375
2044/3605	Manage the matter as well as you can my good man it does not concern me the more so as I have not a livre	104.17875671386719
2045/3605	Come said DArtagnan let us inquire	21.8575439453125
2046/3605	Athoss horse where is that   In the	95.42472076416016
2047/3605	How much is it worth   Fifty pistoles at	226.54803466796875
2048/3605	Take it and there ends the	720.315673828125
2049/3605	What cried Athos are you selling my horsemy Bajazet And pray upon what shall I make my campaign upon Grimaud   I have brought you another said DArtagn	165.85289001464844
2050/3605	Another   And a magnificent one cried the	62.68651580810547
2051/3605	Well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us	279.930419921875
2052/3605	What asked the host quite cheerful	678.4334106445312

2054/3605	There are twentyfive bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my	341.6763000488281
2055/3605	Why this man is a cask said the host	174.450927734375
2056/3605	If he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks I shall soon reestablish my	1330.530029296875
2057/3605	And dont forget said DArtagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two English	77.00418090820312
2058/3605	As he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the	214.9410400390625
2059/3605	Thats well said Athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to Porthos and Aramis But you DArtagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally You have a sad	42.047183990478516
2060/3605	Alas said DArtagnan it is because I am the most	16.61423110961914
2061/3605	Presently And why presently Because you think I am drunk DArtagnan remember this My ideas are never so clear as when I have had plenty of	190.04884338378906
2062/3605	Athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said Trifles only trifles That was his favorite	459.67681884765625
2063/3605	You always say _trifles_ my dear Athos said DArtagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never	103.1267318725586
2064/3605	The drinkdeadened eye of Athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as	500.62078857421875
2065/3605	Thats true said he quietly for my part I have never	158.26246643066406

2067/3605	What do you say   I say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death You are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear DArtagn	97.80805206298828
2068/3605	Except you Athos who never had	77.69281005859375

2072/3605	Not a bad idea said Athos emptying and refilling his	289.3379211425781
2073/3605	Athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so DArtagnan saw that he became	38.87506866455078
2074/3605	He was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to	226.82388305664062
2075/3605	He kept himself upright and dreamed without	2159.678955078125
2076/3605	This somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in	1180.68408203125
2077/3605	Through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the	131.50865173339844
2078/3605	She lived in a small town with her brother who was a cur	100.53334045410156
2079/3605	Both had recently come into the	161.97413635253906
2080/3605	They came nobody knew whence but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they	1398.3206787109375
2081/3605	They were said however to be of good	546.5840454101562
2082/3605	My friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his willfor he was	219.1436767578125
2083/3605	Who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown persons Unfortunately he was an honorable man he married	141.6007537841797
2084/3605	The fool The ass The idiot   How so if he loved her asked DArtagn	253.74134826660156
2085/3605	He took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becoming	211.0556640625
2086/3605	Well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued Athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and f	76.55261993408203
2087/3605	The count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her	319.7280578613281
2088/3605	DArtagnan said Athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her	99.88615417480469
2089/3605	Athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his	72.76324462890625
2090/3605	What do you tell me   Truth my	47.55519104003906
2091/3605	The angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a	447.2578125
2092/3605	And what did the count do   The count was of the highest	58.789913177490234
2093/3605	He had on his estates the rights of high and low tribun	440.2491455078125
2094/3605	He tore the dress of the countess to pieces he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a	282.40252685546875
2095/3605	No less said Athos as pale as a	99.85005950927734
2096/3605	But methinks I need wine and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary	135.13925170898438
2097/3605	Then he let his head sink upon his two hands while DArtagnan stood before him stupef	29.08201026916504
2098/3605	That has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said Athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the	358.9504699707031
2099/3605	God grant you as much Let us	312.3984375
2100/3605	Some ham my boy or we cant	1952.9447021484375
2101/3605	Oh I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night	336.0954284667969
2102/3605	Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was   He was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair	159.8865966796875

2104/3605	He has been hanged and quartered I	493.71185302734375
2105/3605	My God my God cried DArtagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible	103.95440673828125
2106/3605	Taste some of this ham DArtagnan it is exquisite said Athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young mans	131.71449279785156
2107/3605	What a pity it is there were only four like this in the	219.3643798828125
2108/3605	I could have drunk fifty bottles	1344.892822265625
2109/3605	DArtagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewild	40.010501861572266
2110/3605	Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to	117.31767272949219
2111/3605	THE RETURN     DArtagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half	252.793212890625
2112/3605	Besides which the Musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter	202.29368591308594
2113/3605	I was pretty drunk yesterday DArtagnan said he I can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very trem	228.30679321289062
2114/3605	I wager that I uttered a thousand extravag	645.7083129882812
2115/3605	While saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed	80.83583068847656
2116/3605	No replied DArtagnan if I recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common	43.47516632080078
2117/3605	I thought I had told you a most lamentable	131.10093688964844
2118/3605	And he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his	16.567447662353516
2119/3605	My faith said DArtagnan it appears that I was more drunk than you since I remember nothing of the	49.64801025390625
2120/3605	Athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you cannot have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or	314.38427734375
2121/3605	My drunkenness is always sad and when I am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my	673.6104125976562
2122/3605	That is my failinga capital failing I admit but with that exception I am a good drink	614.1085815429688
2123/3605	Athos spoke this in so natural a manner that DArtagnan was shaken in his	70.52640533447266
2124/3605	It is that then replied the young man anxious to find out the truth it is that then I remember as we remember a	92.68164825439453
2125/3605	Ah you see how it is said Athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh I was sure it was sothe hanging of people is my	245.4777374267578
2126/3605	I remember now yes it was aboutstop a minuteyes it was about a	656.9296875
2127/3605	Thats it replied Athos becoming almost livid that is my grand story of the fair lady and when I relate that I must be very	147.91331481933594
2128/3605	Yes that was it said DArtagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue	58.136085510253906
2129/3605	By her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued DArtagnan looking intently at Ath	25.53958511352539
2130/3605	Well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied Athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of	35.001197814941406
2131/3605	I certainly never will get drunk again DArtagnan it is too bad a	134.72073364257812
2132/3605	DArtagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once Athos said   By the by I thank you for the horse you have brought	39.678531646728516
2133/3605	Is it to your mind asked DArtagn	35.566864013671875
2134/3605	Yes but it is not a horse for hard	142.54791259765625
2135/3605	You are mistaken I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the Place	88.96046447753906
2136/3605	Ah you begin to awaken my	664.0692138671875
2137/3605	Regret   Yes I have parted with	148.5325927734375
2138/3605	How   Why here is the simple	88.63739013671875
2139/3605	This morning I awoke at six o	111.56499481201172
2140/3605	You were still fast asleep and I did not know what to do with myself I was still stupid from our yesterdays debau	134.6365966796875
2141/3605	As I came into the public room I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from	378.6295471191406
2142/3605	I drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut n	120.93258666992188
2143/3605	_Pardieu_ said I my good gentleman I have a horse to sell	156.819091796875
2144/3605	Ay and a very fine one I saw him yesterday your friends lackey was leading	302.2601318359375
2145/3605	Do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles Yes Will you sell him to me for that sum No but I will play for	62.949302673339844
2146/3605	No sooner said than done and I lost the	2370.06201171875
2147/3605	Ah ah But please to observe I won back the equipage cried Ath	555.857666015625
2148/3605	Well I must confess it does replied DArtagn	22.887964248657227
2149/3605	That horse was to have identified us in the day of	549.4144897460938
2150/3605	But my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the Musket	66.80975341796875
2151/3605	I was hipped to death and still further upon my honor I dont like English	285.8061828613281
2152/3605	If it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable	182.38052368164062
2153/3605	As to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its	152.4217529296875
2154/3605	Why the devil A horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy   DArtagnan did not	339.8092346191406
2155/3605	It vexes me greatly continued Athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for I am not yet at the end of my	100.89923858642578
2156/3605	After having lost my own horse nine against tensee how nearI formed an idea of staking	3566.38916015625
2157/3605	Yes but you stopped at the idea I hope   No for I put it in execution that very	64.20602416992188
2158/3605	And the consequence said DArtagnan in great	72.55972290039062
2159/3605	What my horse   Your horse seven against eight a point shortyou know the	542.85986328125
2160/3605	Athos you are not in your right senses I	111.55499267578125
2161/3605	My dear lad that was yesterday when I was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this	281.04974365234375
2162/3605	I lost him then with all his appointments and	349.6865234375
2163/3605	Stop a minute you dont know all	192.26808166503906
2164/3605	I should make an excellent gambler if I were not too hotheaded but I was hotheaded just as if I had been	75.05359649658203
2165/3605	Well I was not hotheaded then   Well but what else could you play for You had nothing left   Oh yes my friend there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger and which I had observed	132.46078491210938
2166/3605	This diamond said DArtagnan placing his hand eagerly on his	39.65690231323242
2167/3605	And as I am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once I estimated it at a thousand pist	75.68677520751953
2168/3605	Athos you make me tremble cried DArtagn	16.815139770507812
2169/3605	I mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked	411.0059509277344
2170/3605	What the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it Impossible   Go on go on my dear fellow said DArtagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your	63.20170211791992
2171/3605	We divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles	153.47972106933594
2172/3605	You are laughing at me and want to try me said DArtagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as Minerva takes Achilles in the _Iliad	433.32330322265625
2173/3605	No I do not jest _mordieu_ I should like to have seen you in my place I had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of	101.64620208740234
2174/3605	That was no reason for staking my diamond replied DArtagnan closing his hand with a nervous sp	100.19823455810547
2175/3605	Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge in thirteen throws I had lost allin thirteen	1501.9755859375
2176/3605	The number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of July that   _Ventrebleu_ cried DArtagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding	132.66307067871094
2177/3605	Patience said Athos I had a	42.11488723754883
2178/3605	The Englishman was an original I had seen him conversing that morning with Grimaud and Grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his	45.35337448120117
2179/3605	I staked Grimaud the silent Grimaud divided into ten	969.5361328125
2180/3605	Well what next said DArtagnan laughing in spite of	17.831523895263672
2181/3605	Grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of Grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon I regained the	930.3473510742188
2182/3605	Tell me now if persistence is not a virtue   My faith But this is droll cried DArtagnan consoled and holding his sides with	275.8817138671875
2183/3605	You may guess finding the luck turned that I again staked the	1157.43896484375
2184/3605	The devil said DArtagnan becoming angry	52.71102523803711
2185/3605	I won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then I lost	531.6342163085938
2186/3605	In brief I regained your harness and then	1516.027587890625
2187/3605	That was a superb throw so I left off	958.8037109375
2188/3605	DArtagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his	76.56597900390625
2189/3605	Then the diamond is safe said he timid	95.1574935913086
2190/3605	Intact my dear friend besides the harness of your Bucephalus and	2018.5074462890625
2191/3605	But what is the use of harnesses without horses   I have an idea about	116.6318359375
2192/3605	You have not played for a long time DArtagn	25.67207908630371
2193/3605	And I have no inclination to	60.653934478759766
2194/3605	You have not played for a long time I said you ought then to have a good	66.55867767333984
2195/3605	Well what then   Well the Englishman and his companion are still	51.059471130371094
2196/3605	I remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very	911.2153930664062
2197/3605	You appear to think much of your	284.4413146972656
2198/3605	In your place I would stake the furniture against the	878.4321899414062
2199/3605	But he will not wish for only one	315.5753173828125
2200/3605	Stake both _pardieu_ I am not selfish as you	79.11749267578125
2201/3605	You would do so said DArtagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of Athos begin to prevail in spite of	119.88265228271484
2202/3605	On my honor in one single	661.054931640625
2203/3605	But having lost the horses I am particularly anxious to preserve the harness	527.8255615234375
2204/3605	Never never   The devil said Ath	38.56318283081055
2205/3605	I would propose to you to stake Planchet but as that has already been done the Englishman would not perhaps be	80.77079010009766
2206/3605	Decidedly my dear Athos said DArtagnan I should like better not to risk	40.082359313964844
2207/3605	Good Lord try one throw One throw is soon made   And if I lose   You will	707.9035034179688
2208/3605	But if I lose   Well you will surrender the harness	297.6463928222656
2209/3605	Have with you for one throw said DArtagn	47.56648635864258
2210/3605	Athos went in quest of the Englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy	204.38548278808594
2211/3605	He proposed the conditionsthe two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pist	467.8191833496094
2212/3605	The Englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred pist	509.9990234375
2213/3605	DArtagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified Athos who however consented himself with saying Thats a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsie	246.5712127685547
2214/3605	The Englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the	229.34303283691406
2215/3605	He threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory DArtagnan turned aside to conceal his ill	119.56243896484375
2216/3605	Hold hold hold said Athos wit his quiet tone that throw of the dice is	1528.61083984375
2217/3605	I have not seen such a one four times in my	45.126224517822266
2218/3605	Two aces   The Englishman looked and was seized with aston	59.56607437133789
2219/3605	DArtagnan looked and was seized with	61.31514358520508
2220/3605	Then Monsieur takes his horse back again said the English	71.98291015625
2221/3605	Then there is no revenge   Our conditions said No revenge you will please to recol	221.99940490722656
2222/3605	That is true the horse shall be restored to your lackey monsie	54.511871337890625
2223/3605	A moment said Athos with your permission monsieur I wish to speak a word with my	37.06644821166992
2224/3605	Well Tempter what more do you want with me said DArtagn	119.29530334472656
2225/3605	You want me to throw again do you not   No I would wish you to	59.61307144165039

2227/3605	You know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your	327.826416015625
2228/3605	Well then I repeat you are	71.41258239746094
2229/3605	What is the use of one horse for us two I could not ride	124.19088745117188
2230/3605	We should look like the two sons of Aymon who had lost their	977.2852172851562
2231/3605	You cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent	890.3902587890625
2232/3605	For my part I should not hesitate a moment I should take the hundred pist	81.83527374267578
2233/3605	We want money for our return to	87.89746856689453

2242/3605	Nothing nothing Go on   Your advice then   To take the hundred pistoles DArtagn	37.002811431884766

2246/3605	Take the hundred pistoles my friend take the hundred pistoles   DArtagnan only required one reason to be	37.946022033691406
2247/3605	Besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of Ath	226.47479248046875
2248/3605	He acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the Englishman paid down on the	406.7798767089844

2251/3605	However ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at Crèvecœ	669.3630981445312
2252/3605	From a distance they perceived Aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like Sister Anne at the dust in the	238.49993896484375
2253/3605	_Holà_ Aramis What the devil are you doing there cried the two	170.75718688964844
2254/3605	Ah is that you DArtagnan and you Athos said the young	29.229928970336914
2255/3605	I was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave	172.5803985595703
2256/3605	My English horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the	334.53155517578125
2257/3605	Life itself may be resolved into three words _Erat est fuit	4729.9365234375

2263/3605	At the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the Amiens road pulled up at the inn and Planchet and Grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their	125.83235168457031
2264/3605	The cart was returning empty to Paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to slake the wagoners thirst along the	702.8787231445312
2265/3605	What is this said Aramis on seeing them	125.9399185180664
2266/3605	Nothing but saddles   Now do you understand said Ath	57.48684310913086
2267/3605	My friends thats exactly like me I retained my harness by	1603.6373291015625
2268/3605	_Holà_ Bazin Bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these	1219.6060791015625
2269/3605	And what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked DArtagn	62.76850509643555
2270/3605	My dear fellow I invited them to a dinner the next day replied Aram	106.10166931152344
2271/3605	They have some capital wine hereplease to observe that in	2359.1025390625
2272/3605	I did my best to make them	233.73977661132812
2273/3605	Then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the Jesuit entreated me to get him made a Musket	155.86068725585938
2274/3605	Without a thesis cried DArtagnan without a thesis I demand the suppression of the	692.181884765625

2279/3605	It has four hundred lines and lasts a	1261.7103271484375
2280/3605	My faith my dear Aramis said DArtagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did Latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two	207.62249755859375
2281/3605	You will see continued Aramis that it breathes irreproachable	643.6300048828125
2282/3605	And so my friends we return to Paris Bravo I am	189.01504516601562
2283/3605	We are going to rejoin that good fellow Porth	27.210163116455078
2284/3605	You cant think how I have missed him the great simple	450.47149658203125
2285/3605	To see him so selfsatisfied reconciles me with	1044.269287109375
2286/3605	He would not sell his horse not for a kingdom I think I can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome	209.0693817138672
2287/3605	I am sure he will look like the Great Mogul   They made a halt for an hour to refresh their	288.40997314453125
2288/3605	Aramis discharged his bill placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join Porth	113.46537780761719
2289/3605	They found him up less pale than when DArtagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four	94.54289245605469
2290/3605	This dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb	97344.125

2294/3605	Besides here is a piquant _fricandeau_ and a fillet of	894.5974731445312
2295/3605	I am recruiting myself said Porthos I am recruiting	494.91607666015625
2296/3605	Nothing weakens a man more than these devilish	7968.08251953125
2297/3605	Did you ever suffer from a strain Athos   Never Though I remember in our affair of the Rue Férou I received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same	141.82894897460938
2298/3605	But this dinner was not intended for you alone Porthos said Aram	52.555023193359375

2302/3605	_Pardieu_ replied DArtagnan for my part I am eating veal garnished with shrimps and	395.0666198730469
2303/3605	And I some lamb chops said Porth	1572.25439453125
2304/3605	And I a plain chicken said Aram	607.5844116210938
2305/3605	You are all mistaken gentlemen answered Athos gravely you are eating	242.70310974121094
2306/3605	Horse said Aramis with a grimace of	87.46511840820312
2307/3605	Are we not eating a horse Porthos And perhaps his saddle there	386.3155517578125
2308/3605	No gentlemen I have kept the harness said Porth	92.16443634033203
2309/3605	My faith said Aramis we are all	158.6178436279297
2310/3605	One would think we had tipped the	5775.11865234375
2311/3605	This horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and I dont like to humiliate	289.8151550292969
2312/3605	Then your duchess is still at the waters asked DArtagn	59.09142303466797
2313/3605	And my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen I expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that I gave him to	126.58629608154297
2314/3605	My God yes _gave_ that is the word said Porthos for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis and the stingy fellow would only give me	89.06848907470703
2315/3605	You will observe gentlemen said Athos that Porthos has made the best bargain of any of	89.42400360107422
2316/3605	And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor Porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his	98.81546020507812
2317/3605	There is one comfort we are all in cash said DArtagn	83.56289672851562
2318/3605	Well for my part said Athos I found Aramiss Spanish wine so good that I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lac	243.5057373046875
2319/3605	And I said Aramis imagined that I had given almost my last sou to the church of Montdidier and the Jesuits of Amiens with whom I had made engagements which I ought to have	76.18925476074219
2320/3605	I have ordered Masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which I have not the least doubt you will be marvelously	465.45611572265625
2321/3605	Ay ay said Athos exchanging a smile with DArtagnan and Aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good	108.72801971435547
2322/3605	In short said Porthos when all my expenses are paid I shall have at most thirty crowns	197.8169403076172
2323/3605	And I about ten pistoles said Aram	71.54015350341797
2324/3605	Well then it appears that we are the Crœsuses of the	431.5057067871094
2325/3605	How much have you left of your hundred pistoles DArtagnan   Of my hundred pistoles Why in the first place I gave you	39.05560302734375
2326/3605	You think so   _Pardieu_   Ah that is	12.139389038085938
2327/3605	What a brute of a host Why did you give him six pistoles   You told me to give them to	50.1201286315918
2328/3605	It is true I am too goodnat	50.806514739990234
2329/3605	In brief how much remains   Twentyfive pistoles said DArtagn	59.26019287109375
2330/3605	And I said Athos taking some small change from his pocket I   You Nothing   My faith So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general	158.94000244140625
2331/3605	Now then let us calculate how much we posses in	553.2474975585938
2332/3605	Four hundred and seventyfive livres said DArtagnan who reckoned like Archim	217.53390502929688
2333/3605	On our arrival in Paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said Porth	109.22119140625
2334/3605	Well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw	76.34069061279297
2335/3605	There   Let us dine then said Porthos it is getting	24.372169494628906
2336/3605	The friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton Bazin Planchet and Grim	58.52023696899414
2337/3605	On arriving in Paris DArtagnan found a letter from	43.63775634765625
2338/3605	de Tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the Musket	60.439517974853516
2339/3605	As this was the height of DArtagnans worldly ambitionapart be it well understood from his desire of finding M	569.467529296875

2341/3605	They were assembled in council at the residence of Athos which always indicated an event of some	172.1666259765625
2342/3605	de Tréville had intimated to them his Majestys fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of May and they must immediately prepare their	865.5241088867188
2343/3605	The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilder	449.20123291015625
2344/3605	de Tréville never jested in matters relating to	1004.5824584960938
2345/3605	And what do you reckon your outfit will cost said DArtagn	143.8107452392578
2346/3605	We have made our calculations with Spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred liv	902.977294921875
2347/3605	Four times fifteen makes sixtysix thousand livres said Ath	186.29148864746094
2348/3605	It seems to me said DArtagnan with a thousand livres eachI do not speak as a Spartan but as a procurator   This word _procurator_ roused Porth	99.26817321777344
2349/3605	Stop said he I have an	27.624364852905273
2350/3605	Well thats something for I have not the shadow of one said Athos coolly but as to DArtagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to _ours_ has driven him out of his	122.63351440429688
2351/3605	A thousand livres For my part I declare I want two	130.15110778808594
2352/3605	Four times two makes eight then said Aramis it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the sadd	321.29736328125
2353/3605	Besides said Athos waiting till DArtagnan who went to thank Monsieur de Tréville had shut the door besides there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our	51.881309509277344
2354/3605	What the devil DArtagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his	81.2905502319336
2355/3605	To this preoccupation of his vanity DArtagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less	111.3386459350586
2356/3605	Bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of	173.5560760498047
2357/3605	de Tréville had spoken of her to the	48.361106872558594
2358/3605	The queen was ignorant where the mercers young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure DArtagn	209.73379516601562
2359/3605	Athos did not leave his chamber he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip	122.47368621826172
2360/3605	It will then be said of me that I died for the king so that I shall have performed my duty without the expense of an	125.81632995605469
2361/3605	Porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating I shall follow up on my	133.782958984375
2362/3605	Aramis anxious and negligently dressed said	631.3279418945312
2363/3605	It may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the	636.7199096679688
2364/3605	The lackeys on their part like the coursers of Hippolytus shared the sadness of their	1206.0986328125
2365/3605	The three friendsfor as we have said Athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himselfwent out early in the morning and returned late at	342.54168701171875
2366/3605	They wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind	109.67377471923828
2367/3605	They might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they	833.1558837890625
2368/3605	When they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say Have you found anything   However as Porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to	111.80149841308594
2369/3605	He was a man of execution this worthy Porth	33.04343795776367
2370/3605	DArtagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of	61.20370864868164
2371/3605	He entered after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant	985.9082641601562
2372/3605	As DArtagnan took some precautions to conceal himself Porthos believed he had not been	51.965763092041016
2373/3605	Porthos went and leaned against the side of a	53.478118896484375
2374/3605	DArtagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other	62.42128372192383
2375/3605	There happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of	370.35980224609375
2376/3605	Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the	663.9634399414062
2377/3605	Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the	168.55035400390625
2378/3605	DArtagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which Porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black	433.2255859375
2379/3605	The eyes of Porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the n	619.2545166015625
2380/3605	On her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos and then immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anx	70.38150787353516
2381/3605	It was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her	221.8123321533203
2382/3605	The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of Porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little Negro and the maidserv	711.49365234375
2383/3605	It was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained	1137.3123779296875
2384/3605	Then she cried Ahem under cover of the _mea culpa_ striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward	1182.575439453125
2385/3605	Nevertheless he understood it all but was	429.4235534667969
2386/3605	DArtagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos which amused him	84.12236022949219
2387/3605	He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurators wife of the Rue aux Ours which was the more probable from the church of	1080.8228759765625
2388/3605	Leu being not far from that	2107.8994140625
2389/3605	He guessed likewise by induction that Porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of Chantilly when the procurators wife had proved so refractory with respect to her	1004.8339233398438
2390/3605	Amid all this DArtagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of Porth	69.33110046386719
2391/3605	There were only chimeras and illusions but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras   The sermon over the procurators wife advanced toward the holy	1734.0478515625
2392/3605	Porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand	172.39352416992188
2393/3605	The procurators wife smiled thinking that it was for her Porthos had put himself to this trouble but she was cruelly and promptly unde	439.7682800292969
2394/3605	When she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her	126.21868896484375
2395/3605	When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos Porthos drew his dripping hand from the	174.0991668701172

2397/3605	This was too much for the procurators wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and Porth	275.7707214355469

2399/3605	Monsieur Porthos said the procurators wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes I have something to say to	77.23320007324219
2400/3605	Certainly madame said Porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pl	130.76397705078125
2401/3605	At that moment DArtagnan passed in pursuit of Milady he cast a passing glance at Porthos and beheld this triumphant	107.55289459228516
2402/3605	Magloirea littlefrequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each	8046.37646484375
2403/3605	In the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at	645.9590454101562
2404/3605	And that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat   Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman M	132.60879516601562
2405/3605	Porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a	195.1865692138672
2406/3605	Ah you are quite the pet of the ladies Monsieur Porthos resumed the procurators wife with a	328.7685241699219
2407/3605	Well responded Porthos you may imagine with the physique with which nature has endowed me I am not in want of good	168.5161895751953
2408/3605	Good Lord how quickly men forget cried the procurators wife raising her eyes toward	2844.253173828125
2409/3605	Less quickly than the women it seems to me replied Porthos for I madame I may say I was your victim when wounded dying I was abandoned by the	146.91348266601562
2410/3605	But Monsieur Porthos murmured the procurators wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was	158.0000457763672
2411/3605	I who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de   I know it	123.5621566772461
2412/3605	The Comtesse de   Monsieur Porthos be generous   You are right madame and I will not	31.82806396484375
2413/3605	But it was my husband who would not hear of	246.5140838623047
2414/3605	Madame Coquenard said Porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which I preserve engraved in my	224.0972900390625
2415/3605	Besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather	595.5687255859375
2416/3605	Madame Coquenard I gave you the	671.528076171875
2417/3605	I had but to write to the Duchessebut I wont repeat her name for I am incapable of compromising a woman but this I know that I had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen	130.1636505126953
2418/3605	Monsieur Porthos said she I can assure you that you have severely punished me and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to	46.828155517578125
2419/3605	Fie madame fie said Porthos as if	491.1861267089844
2420/3605	Let us not talk about money if you please it is	121.28022766113281
2421/3605	Then you no longer love me said the procurators wife slowly and	1486.0167236328125
2422/3605	And that is the only reply you make Alas I	225.52688598632812
2423/3605	Think of the offense you have committed toward me madame It remains _here_ said Porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it	167.70120239257812
2424/3605	I will repair it indeed I will my dear Porth	83.72514343261719
2425/3605	Besides what did I ask of you resumed Porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good	68.30889892578125
2426/3605	A loan nothing more After all I am not an unreasonable	744.6224975585938
2427/3605	I know you are not rich Madame Coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from	176.4323272705078
2428/3605	Oh If you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardon	40.94268798828125
2429/3605	Please to know Monsieur Porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurators wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected min	474.6988830566406
2430/3605	That doubles the offense said Porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurators wife for if you are rich Madame Coquenard then there is no excuse for your	607.1956787109375
2431/3605	When I said rich replied the procurators wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word	652.756103515625
2432/3605	I am not precisely rich though I am pretty well	137.9947967529297
2433/3605	Hold madame said Porthos let us say no more upon the subject I beg of	21.051536560058594
2434/3605	You have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between	2075.318359375
2435/3605	Ingrate that you are   Ah I advise you to complain said Porth	55.57357406616211
2436/3605	Begone then to your beautiful duchess I will detain you no	106.22032165527344
2437/3605	And she is not to be despised in my	47.797447204589844
2438/3605	Something whispers me so continued Porthos becoming more and more	165.82859802246094
2439/3605	Rather say that you have a new	97.78883361816406
2440/3605	Not so I speak frankly to	134.6376953125
2441/3605	No object affects me and I even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for	152.82369995117188
2442/3605	But in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to	96.04651641845703
2443/3605	I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my	268.3138427734375
2444/3605	Then I must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of Brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my	163.7613525390625
2445/3605	Porthos observed a last struggle between love and avar	81.85689544677734
2446/3605	And as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey	173.7217559814453
2447/3605	Journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in	3195.494384765625
2448/3605	Have you no friends in Paris then Monsieur Porthos said the procurators	324.6845703125
2449/3605	I thought I had said Porthos resuming his melancholy air but I have been taught my	87.57379150390625
2450/3605	You have some cried the procurators wife in a transport that surprised even	5746.505859375
2451/3605	You are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from Noyon in Picardy you have several lawsuits and no	426.4270935058594
2452/3605	Can you recollect all that   Perfectly mad	36.484954833984375
2453/3605	And be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventysix	488.54730224609375
2454/3605	Seventysix years _Peste_ Thats a fine age replied Porth	113.68032836914062
2455/3605	A great age you mean Monsieur Porth	78.94805908203125
2456/3605	Yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at Porth	89.83197784423828
2457/3605	Fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes	2344.55419921875
2458/3605	You are a woman of precaution I see my dear Madame Coquenard said Porthos squeezing the hand of the procurators wife tender	635.3869018554688
2459/3605	We are then reconciled dear Monsieur Porthos said she sim	298.934326171875
2460/3605	For life replied Porthos in the same	30.258480072021484
2461/3605	DARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN     DArtagnan followed Milady without being perceived by	14631.8056640625
2462/3605	He saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to	100.7240219116211
2463/3605	It was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful	182.68218994140625
2464/3605	DArtagnan therefore returned to the Rue Fé	14.407212257385254
2465/3605	In the Rue de Seine he met Planchet who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing	230.9010772705078
2466/3605	He ordered him to go and saddle two horses in	129.71878051757812
2467/3605	de Trévilles stablesone for himself DArtagnan and one for Planchetand bring them to Athoss	160.19833374023438
2468/3605	Once for all Tréville had placed his stable at DArtagnans	105.65869140625
2469/3605	Planchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier and DArtagnan toward the Rue Fé	17.65582275390625
2470/3605	Athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous Spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into Picard	191.003662109375
2471/3605	He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for DArtagnan and Grimaud obeyed as	26.34515953063965
2472/3605	DArtagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between Porthos and the procurators wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be	124.70858764648438
2473/3605	As for me replied Athos to this recital I am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my	87.21112060546875
2474/3605	Handsome wellbred noble lord as you are my dear Athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicit	485.192626953125
2475/3605	How young this DArtagnan is said Athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to Grimaud to bring another	20.184812545776367
2476/3605	At that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the halfopen door and told his master that the horses were	88.24999237060547
2477/3605	Two horses that Monsieur de Tréville lends me at my pleasure and with which I am now going to take a ride to	57.317440032958984
2478/3605	Well and what are you going to do at	30.014352798461914
2479/3605	Then DArtagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind	148.55801391601562
2480/3605	That is to say you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame Bonacieux said Athos shrugging his shoulders contemptuously as if he pitied human	57.301509857177734
2481/3605	I am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is	204.53172302246094
2482/3605	I do not know why but I imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as I am has an influence over my	38.9659538269043
2483/3605	Well perhaps you are right said Ath	17.391843795776367
2484/3605	I do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once	63.722251892089844
2485/3605	Madame Bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is	62.496578216552734
2486/3605	What is to be said I must divert my attention   Amuse yourself with Milady my dear DArtagnan I wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse	80.16512298583984
2487/3605	Instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to	195.218017578125
2488/3605	My dear fellow said Athos I ride horses when I have any when I have none I go a	145.6896514892578
2489/3605	Well said DArtagnan smiling at the misanthropy of Athos which from any other person would have offended him I ride what I can get I am not so proud as	56.952293395996094
2490/3605	_Au revoir_ said the Musketeer making a sign to Grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just	101.42173767089844
2491/3605	DArtagnan and Planchet mounted and took the road to	15.60027027130127
2492/3605	All along the road what Athos had said respecting M	230.5487060546875
2493/3605	Bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young	34.66954040527344
2494/3605	Although DArtagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercers pretty wife had made a real impression upon his	257.987548828125
2495/3605	As he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to	122.91697692871094
2496/3605	Meantime he was going to try to find out Mil	94.54383850097656
2497/3605	Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew	241.98411560058594
2498/3605	Now in the opinion of DArtagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off M	73.56035614013672
2499/3605	Bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the	74.15394592285156
2500/3605	DArtagnan then only halflied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of Milady he at the same time went in search of Const	136.13003540039062
2501/3605	Thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse DArtagnan completed his short journey and arrived at	93.87620544433594
2502/3605	He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later Louis	107.92845153808594
2503/3605	This person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with	86.92961883544922
2504/3605	Eh monsieur said he addressing DArtagnan dont you remember that face which is blinking yonder   No said DArtagnan and yet I am certain it is not the first time I have seen that vis	23.69085121154785
2505/3605	_Parbleu_ I believe it is not said Planc	37.1131706237793
2506/3605	Why it is poor Lubin the lackey of the Comte de Wardeshe whom you took such good care of a month ago at Calais on the road to the governors country house   So it is said DArtagnan I know him	151.4029998779297
2507/3605	Do you think he would recollect you   My faith monsieur he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of	72.6820297241211
2508/3605	Well go and talk with the boy said DArtagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is	83.34796142578125
2509/3605	At the end of an instants observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw Miladys carriage stop opposite to	137.44888305664062
2510/3605	He could not be mistaken Milady was in	96.81602478027344
2511/3605	DArtagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being	21.942415237426758
2512/3605	Milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her	230.45263671875
2513/3605	The maid approached Planchet whom she took for Lubin and holding out a little billet to him said For your	402.1719055175781
2514/3605	Thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove	149.9759063720703
2515/3605	Then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met DArtagnan who having seen all was coming to	77.58607482910156
2516/3605	For you monsieur said Planchet presenting the billet to the young	29.14509391784668
2517/3605	For me said DArtagnan are you sure of that   _Pardieu_ monsieur I cant be more	14.482499122619629
2518/3605	Oh said DArtagnan this is rather warm it appears that Milady and I are anxious about the health of the same	57.43859100341797
2519/3605	As I said monsieur Lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the	208.02821350097656
2520/3605	Well done Planchet you are the king of lac	69.6098861694336
2521/3605	Now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the	274.04693603515625
2522/3605	At the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside a cavalier richly dressed was close to the	57.92216491699219
2523/3605	The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that DArtagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his	90.61760711669922
2524/3605	The conversation took place in Englisha language which DArtagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful Englishwoman was in a great	112.82648468017578
2525/3605	She terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand	288.4376220703125
2526/3605	The cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate Milady still	227.0217742919922
2527/3605	DArtagnan thought this was the moment to	36.30833053588867
2528/3605	He approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said Madame will you permit me to offer you my services It appears to me that this cavalier has made you very	57.909488677978516
2529/3605	Speak one word madame and I take upon myself to punish him for his want of	106.21221923828125
2530/3605	At the first word Milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good French Monsieur I should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my	95.8395004272461
2531/3605	You must be aware that I was ignorant of that mad	22.460243225097656
2532/3605	What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about cried the cavalier whom Milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach	264.23199462890625
2533/3605	Why does not he go about his business   Stupid fellow yourself said DArtagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage	120.49449920654297
2534/3605	I do not go on because it pleases me to stop	37.938377380371094
2535/3605	The cavalier addressed some words in English to his	142.51025390625
2536/3605	I speak to you in French said DArtagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same	30.28695297241211
2537/3605	You are Madames brother I learnbe it so but fortunately you are not	1114.422119140625
2538/3605	The carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated	247.31446838378906
2539/3605	Well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than I am for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us	40.31679916381836
2540/3605	Ah said the Englishman is it you my master It seems you must always be playing some game or	115.67244720458984
2541/3605	Yes and that reminds me that I have a revenge to	45.427093505859375
2542/3605	We will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice	118.46586608886719
2543/3605	You see plainly that I have no sword said the English	39.44720458984375
2544/3605	Do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man   I hope you have a sword at home but at all events I have two and if you like I will throw with you for one of	73.07994842529297
2545/3605	Needless said the Englishman I am well furnished with such play	563.3544311523438
2546/3605	Very well my worthy gentleman replied DArtagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this	109.6173095703125
2547/3605	Where if you please   Behind the Luxembourg thats a charming spot for such amusements as the one I propose to	113.40253448486328
2548/3605	That will do I will be	148.34559631347656
2549/3605	_A propos_ you have probably one or two friends   I have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with	229.8030242919922
2550/3605	Three Marvelous That falls out oddly Three is just my number   Now then who are you asked the English	988.9130859375
2551/3605	I am Monsieur dArtagnan a Gascon gentleman serving in the kings Musket	24.63059425354004
2552/3605	And you   I am Lord de Winter Baron	334.6710205078125
2553/3605	Well then I am your servant Monsieur Baron said DArtagnan though you have names rather difficult to recol	69.26619720458984
2554/3605	And touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to	376.1978759765625
2555/3605	As he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence DArtagnan went straight to the residence of Ath	39.06270217895508
2556/3605	He found Athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find	77.60742950439453
2557/3605	He related to Athos all that had passed except the letter to	79.9282455444336
2558/3605	Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an English	57.412437438964844
2559/3605	We might say that was his	119.70608520507812
2560/3605	They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the	57.62824249267578
2561/3605	Porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a	81.51455688476562
2562/3605	Aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in Athoss closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing	138.55075073242188
2563/3605	Athos by signs desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of	201.36160278320312
2564/3605	DArtagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they	112.73892974853516
2565/3605	ENGLISH AND FRENCH     The hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the Luxembourg given up to the feeding of	2642.645263671875
2566/3605	Athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to	186.37918090820312
2567/3605	The lackeys were ordered to act as sentin	57.79768371582031
2568/3605	A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the Musket	328.72900390625
2569/3605	Then according to foreign custom the presentations took	6882.66015625
2570/3605	The Englishmen were all men of rank consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise but of	213.183349609375
2571/3605	But after all said Lord de Winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you	48.515018463134766
2572/3605	We cannot fight with such names they are names of shepher	238.38975524902344
2573/3605	Therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said Ath	137.75320434570312
2574/3605	Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the English	87.87132263183594
2575/3605	You played very willingly with us without knowing our names said Athos by the same token that you won our	343.9305725097656
2576/3605	That is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our	175.96786499023438
2577/3605	One plays with anybody but one fights only with	5021.05712890625
2578/3605	And that is but just said Athos and he took aside the one of the four Englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low	55.736228942871094
2579/3605	Does that satisfy you said Athos to his	58.11310958862305
2580/3605	Do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me   Yes monsieur said the Englishman b	38.481990814208984
2581/3605	Well now shall I tell you something added Athos co	82.13622283935547
2582/3605	Why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself	120.125732421875
2583/3605	Why so   Because I am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know I am living so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the	98.971923828125
2584/3605	The Englishman looked at Athos believing that he jested but Athos did not jest the least in the	59.15104675292969
2585/3605	Gentlemen said Athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready   Yes answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen as with one	121.40978240966797
2586/3605	Immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice	1223.5086669921875
2587/3605	Athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing	336.41259765625
2588/3605	Porthos abated no doubt of his toogreat confidence by his adventure of Chantilly played with skill and prud	428.5805358886719
2589/3605	Aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in	233.71981811523438
2590/3605	He hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one the sword pierced his	326.39361572265625
2591/3605	Second Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh As the Englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his	72.09358215332031
2592/3605	Aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lac	405.0328674316406
2593/3605	As to DArtagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword	155.39776611328125
2594/3605	The baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell	187.55474853515625
2595/3605	DArtagnan was over him at a bound and said to the Englishman pointing his sword to his throat I could kill you my Lord you are completely in my hands but I spare your life for the sake of your	61.47220230102539
2596/3605	DArtagnan was at the height of joy he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his	363.0018005371094
2597/3605	As Porthos and Aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his	145.68186950683594
2598/3605	DArtagnan picked it up and offered it to Lord de	20.20157814025879
2599/3605	What the devil would you have me do with that said the English	38.30514907836914
2600/3605	You can restore it to his family said DArtagn	40.022579193115234
2601/3605	His family will care much about such a trifle as that His family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from	208.45578002929688
2602/3605	DArtagnan put the purse into his	13.550167083740234
2603/3605	DArtagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of ass	52.10467529296875
2604/3605	At this time Athos came up to DArtagn	9.903379440307617
2605/3605	What do you mean to do with that purse whispered	81.3238525390625
2606/3605	Why I meant to pass it over to you my dear Ath	36.75168228149414
2607/3605	Me why to me   Why you killed him They are the spoils of	139.48077392578125
2608/3605	Porthos shrugged his shoulders Aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed Ath	103.35673522949219
2609/3605	Then said DArtagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as Lord de Winter desired us to	23.899850845336914
2610/3605	Yes said Athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the English	32.03998565673828
2611/3605	Athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coach	19.813583374023438
2612/3605	This greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even Porthos and this French generosity repeated by Lord de Winter and his friend was highly applauded except by	386.42132568359375
2613/3605	Lord de Winter on quitting DArtagnan gave him his sisters	137.44325256347656
2614/3605	She lived in the Place Royalethen the fashionable quarterat Number 6 and he undertook to call and take DArtagnan with him in order to introduce	271.32989501953125
2615/3605	DArtagnan appointed eight oclock at Athoss	111.42229461669922
2616/3605	This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon	3522.05712890625
2617/3605	He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his	137.91265869140625
2618/3605	According to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot	320.48638916015625
2619/3605	His only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of	411.0318298339844
2620/3605	Then she knew that he was one of the friends of	25.83486557006836
2621/3605	de Tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to Milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with	183.1966094970703
2622/3605	As to the commencement of an intrigue between her and	138.95176696777344
2623/3605	de Wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinals	549.7316284179688
2624/3605	It is not for nothing we are but twenty years old above all if we were born at Tar	95.89125061035156
2625/3605	DArtagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to Athoss and according to custom related everything to	118.53123474121094
2626/3605	Athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of	156.69374084472656
2627/3605	What said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after	197.28292846679688
2628/3605	DArtagnan felt the truth of this rep	32.41446304321289
2629/3605	I loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart while I only love Milady with my head said	147.9346923828125
2630/3605	In getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at	601.7940063476562
2631/3605	The part she plays _pardieu_ It is not difficult to divine that after all you have told	90.78121948242188
2632/3605	She is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your	46.27108383178711
2633/3605	The devil my dear Athos you view things on the dark side meth	402.1053466796875
2634/3605	Can it be otherwise I bought my experience dearlyparticularly fair	9693.5068359375
2635/3605	Milady is fair you say   She has the most beautiful light hair imaginable   Ah my poor DArtagnan said Ath	58.152137756347656
2636/3605	Listen to me I want to be enlightened on a subject then when I shall have learned what I desire to know I will	47.67191696166992
2637/3605	Lord de Winter arrived at the appointed time but Athos being warned of his coming went into the other	106.08663940429688
2638/3605	He therefore found DArtagnan alone and as it was nearly eight oclock he took the young man with	31.34233856201172
2639/3605	An elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the Place	91.51277160644531
2640/3605	Thank him then madame if you have any affection for	55.57188034057617
2641/3605	Milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at	175.38299560546875
2642/3605	The brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with Miladys favorite monkey which had pulled him by the double	145.13735961914062
2643/3605	You are welcome monsieur said Milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of illhumor which DArtagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my	119.43047332763672
2644/3605	The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single	792.6766967773438
2645/3605	Milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to	146.2056121826172
2646/3605	The blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her	186.4966278076172
2647/3605	Lord de Winter perceived nothing of	231.91847229003906
2648/3605	When he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and	110.28020477294922
2649/3605	He filled two glasses and by a sign invited DArtagnan to	112.51996612548828
2650/3605	DArtagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to refuse to pledge	223.9958038330078
2651/3605	He therefore drew near to the table and took the second	68.74227142333984
2652/3605	He did not however lose sight of Milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her	66.59223175048828
2653/3605	Now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her count	246.09056091308594
2654/3605	She bit her handkerchief with her beautiful	128.2415008544922
2655/3605	That pretty little _soubrette_ whom DArtagnan had already observed then came	252.13157653808594
2656/3605	She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English who thereupon requested DArtagnans permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his	188.99530029296875
2657/3605	DArtagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter and then returned to Mil	33.051109313964844
2658/3605	Her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood	447.9461364746094
2659/3605	Those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of	380.5788269042969
2660/3605	She told DArtagnan that Lord de Winter was her brotherinlaw and not her	30.84107208251953
2661/3605	She had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one	136.4141082763672
2662/3605	This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter if Lord de Winter did not	75.83126831054688
2663/3605	All this showed DArtagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this	104.31798553466797
2664/3605	In addition to this after a half hours conversation DArtagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that	224.6923065185547
2665/3605	DArtagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of	167.1688232421875
2666/3605	To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon Milady replied with a smile of	138.06036376953125
2667/3605	The hour came for him to	182.3081817626953
2668/3605	DArtagnan took leave of Milady and left the saloon the happiest of	164.15380859375
2669/3605	On the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_ who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted	272.1573791503906
2670/3605	DArtagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening	59.63541793823242
2671/3605	Lord de Winter was not at home and it was Milady who this time did all the honors of the	76.2340316772461
2672/3605	She appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the	173.82044982910156
2673/3605	DArtagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding Mil	142.29542541503906
2674/3605	He launched into a eulogy of his Eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the kings Guards if he had happened to know	241.00404357910156
2675/3605	Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked DArtagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in	111.3222885131836
2676/3605	DArtagnan replied that he had been sent thither by	24.64423942565918
2677/3605	de Tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as	221.77700805664062
2678/3605	Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips she had to deal with a Gascon who played	122.38915252685547
2679/3605	At the same hour as on the preceding evening DArtagnan	63.3541145324707
2680/3605	In the corridor he again met the pretty Kitty that was the name of the _soubrette	233.97872924804688
2681/3605	She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but DArtagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but	55.38212966918945
2682/3605	DArtagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day Milady gave him a more gracious	86.90475463867188
2683/3605	Every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty _soubrette	182.30018615722656
2684/3605	But as we have said DArtagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor	110.56295013427734
2685/3605	A PROCURATORS DINNER     However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurators	1990.9189453125
2686/3605	On the morrow he received the last touches of Mousquetons brush for an hour and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with	179.68443298339844
2687/3605	His heart beat but not like DArtagnans with a young and impatient	264.08184814453125
2688/3605	No a more material interest stirred his	4966.0439453125
2689/3605	He was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of	416.7579345703125
2690/3605	And yet at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some	147.87628173828125
2691/3605	A shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the	2482.722412109375
2692/3605	In all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive client	923.0068969726562
2693/3605	Although the Musketeer was not expected before one oclock the procurators wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his	353.218017578125
2694/3605	Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward	341.37811279296875
2695/3605	The clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tonguet	1524.2283935546875
2696/3605	It is my cousin cried the procurators	7756.18896484375
2697/3605	Come in come in Monsieur Porthos   The name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but Porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its	93.83145141601562
2698/3605	They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have	107.26368713378906
2699/3605	This last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with	1812.7349853515625
2700/3605	On quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception	273.34283447265625
2701/3605	All these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire Porthos	235.89852905273438
2702/3605	Words might be heard at a distance through all these open	64.5901107788086
2703/3605	The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courte	163.27549743652344
2704/3605	We are cousins it appears Monsieur Porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane	540.7952270507812
2705/3605	The old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and	106.46675872802734
2706/3605	His little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life	441.9069519042969
2707/3605	Unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony	708.3195190429688
2708/3605	During the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his	214.6568145751953
2709/3605	The cousin was received with resignation that was	216.43417358398438
2710/3605	Coquenard firm upon his legs would have declined all relationship with	2706.48291015625
2711/3605	Yes monsieur we are cousins said Porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the	107.66548156738281
2712/3605	By the female side I believe said the procurator malicious	5826.02783203125
2713/3605	Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large	96.61270141601562
2714/3605	Coquenard who knew that a simpleminded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great	1300.59423828125
2715/3605	Coquenard had since the arrival of Porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak	150.0181121826172
2716/3605	Porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the	214.6626434326172
2717/3605	Oh my legs my poor legs where are you murmured Coquenard and he tried to	341.46307373046875
2718/3605	This succor which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the Musketeer toward the procurators	446.8817443847656
2719/3605	They passed into the eating rooma large dark room situated opposite the	452.3702392578125
2720/3605	The clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit	251.53128051757812
2721/3605	Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threaten	161296.59375
2722/3605	Coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by M	1751.475830078125
2723/3605	Coquenard whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the	477.289306640625
2724/3605	He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his	118.77197265625
2725/3605	Oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather	312.58172607421875
2726/3605	What the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said Porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipel	249.9438934326172
2727/3605	Coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his	617.742431640625
2728/3605	Coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient	3930.51025390625
2729/3605	After the soup the maid brought a boiled fowla piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to	175.2474822998047
2730/3605	One may see that you love your family Madame Coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost	1006.32373046875
2731/3605	You are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely   The poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their	317.1635437011719
2732/3605	The fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch to which it had retired to die of old	70.65785217285156
2733/3605	The devil thought Porthos this is poor	136.52720642089844
2734/3605	I respect old age but I dont much like it boiled or	1039.3427734375
2735/3605	And he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his	103.48954010009766
2736/3605	In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearancean enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show	510.3771057128906
2737/3605	But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned counten	1446.284912109375
2738/3605	Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good house	963.3356323242188
2739/3605	Coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to Porthos and M	334.65362548828125
2740/3605	The young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do	197.72471618652344
2741/3605	This brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale top	177.66786193847656
2742/3605	Porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurators wife under the table as it came in search of	191.83372497558594
2743/3605	He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuilthe terror of all expert pal	723.5819091796875
2744/3605	Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed	3670.68212890625
2745/3605	Will you eat any of these beans Cousin Porthos said M	1554.206787109375
2746/3605	Coquenard in that tone which says Take my advice dont touch	836.8507080078125
2747/3605	Devil take me if I taste one of them murmured Porthos to himself and then said aloud Thank you my cousin I am no longer	84.25130462646484
2748/3605	The procurator repeated several times Ah Madame Coquenard Accept my compliments your dinner has been a real	2562.033447265625
2749/3605	Lord how I have eaten  	73.5176773071289
2750/3605	Coquenard had eaten his soup the black feet of the fowl and the only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of	455.9645690917969
2751/3605	Porthos fancied they were mystifying him and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows but the knee of M	277.8354187011719
2752/3605	Coquenard gently advised him to be	1074.8450927734375
2753/3605	This silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to Porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the	162.90725708007812
2754/3605	Upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from M	837.587646484375

2756/3605	Go young men go and promote digestion by working said the procurator grave	5312.1611328125
2757/3605	Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and	2555.04150390625
2758/3605	Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good	1287.4140625
2759/3605	Porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to d	164.97894287109375

2763/3605	Coquenard did not seem to observe	617.5115356445312
2764/3605	This is fine said Porthos to himself I am prettily caught   He passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of M	516.1215209960938
2765/3605	Now said he the sacrifice is consummated Ah if I had not the hope of peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husbands chest  	224.4907684326172
2766/3605	Coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a s	588.055908203125
2767/3605	The procurators wife took Porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a	380.9668273925781
2768/3605	You can come and dine three times a week said M	325.9677734375
2769/3605	Thanks madame said Porthos but I dont like to abuse your kindness besides I must think of my outfit   Thats true said the procurators wife groaning that unfortunate outfit   Alas yes said Porthos it is	115.86090850830078
2770/3605	But of what then does the equipment of your company consist Monsieur Porthos   Oh of many things said Porth	51.32243728637695
2771/3605	The Musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen or the	328.3414611816406
2772/3605	Why they may amount to said Porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by	267.4091796875
2773/3605	I hope it does not exceed She stopped speech failed	2791.541015625
2774/3605	Oh no said Porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres I even think that with economy I could manage it with two thousand liv	130.2528839111328
2775/3605	Good God cried she two thousand livres Why that is a fortune   Porthos made a most significant grimace M	158.71665954589844
2776/3605	I wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business I was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay	304.26275634765625
2777/3605	Ah ah said Porthos that is what you meant to say   Yes dear Monsieur Porth	10.254091262817383
2778/3605	Thus for instance dont you in the first place want a horse   Yes a	71.89533233642578
2779/3605	Well then I can just suit	173.05455017089844
2780/3605	Ah said Porthos brightening thats well as regards my horse but I must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a Musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred liv	246.82554626464844
2781/3605	Three hundred livres Then put down three hundred livres said the procurators wife with a	954.113037109375
2782/3605	It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from	268.117919921875
2783/3605	These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his	556.1864624023438
2784/3605	Then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my val	50.48677444458008
2785/3605	As to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them I have	81.28710174560547
2786/3605	A horse for your lackey resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my	1085.689697265625
2787/3605	But then you understand Madame Coquenard a mule with feathers and	1344.2625732421875
2788/3605	Oh dont let that disturb you cried M	428.4193420410156
2789/3605	My husband has five or six valises you shall choose the	374.1070251464844
2790/3605	There is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the	278.0745544433594
2791/3605	Your valise is then empty asked Porthos with	269.280517578125
2792/3605	Certainly it is empty replied the procurators wife in real	5038.7138671875
2793/3605	Ah but the valise I want cried Porthos is a wellfilled one my	187.46524047851562
2794/3605	Molière had not written his scene in LAvare	3226.52099609375
2795/3605	Coquenard was in the dilemma of Harp	4281.4794921875
2796/3605	These conditions being agreed to Porthos took leave of M	381.3703308105469
2797/3605	The latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but Porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurators wife was obliged to give place to the	390.48297119140625
2798/3605	The Musketeer returned home hungry and in bad	150.75357055664062
2799/3605	SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS     Meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of Athos DArtagnan became hourly more in love with Mil	1003.5512084960938
2800/3605	Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the selfsatisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to	163.05850219726562
2801/3605	Good thought DArtagnan She is charged with some message for me from her mistress she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to	54.964927673339844
2802/3605	And he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air	204.5172882080078
2803/3605	I wish to say three words to you Monsieur Chevalier stammered the _soubrette	86.37920379638672

2806/3605	Well what is to be done   If Monsieur Chevalier would follow me said Kitty timid	49.66056823730469
2807/3605	And Kitty who had not let go the hand of DArtagnan led him up a little dark winding staircase and after ascending about fifteen steps opened a	104.29719543457031
2808/3605	Come in here Monsieur Chevalier said she here we shall be alone and can	54.075103759765625
2809/3605	And whose room is this my dear child   It is mine Monsieur Chevalier it communicates with my mistresss by that	186.6778564453125
2810/3605	She will not hear what we say she never goes to bed before	177.7177734375
2811/3605	The little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which Kitty said led to Miladys	369.867919921875
2812/3605	Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep	77.37042999267578
2813/3605	You love my mistress then very dearly Monsieur Chevalier said	189.2262420654297
2814/3605	Oh more than I can say Kitty I am mad for her   Kitty breathed a second	134.22276306152344
2815/3605	Alas monsieur said she that is too	20.020137786865234
2816/3605	What the devil do you see so bad in it said DArtagn	24.25834083557129
2817/3605	Because monsieur replied Kitty my mistress loves you not at	172.81410217285156
2818/3605	_Hein_ said DArtagnan can she have charged you to tell me so   Oh no monsieur but out of the regard I have for you I have taken the resolution to tell you	38.08896255493164
2819/3605	Much obliged my dear Kitty but for the intention onlyfor the information you must agree is not likely to be at all	233.7675323486328
2820/3605	That is to say you dont believe what I have told you is it not so   We have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self	81.1214599609375
2821/3605	Then you dont believe me   I confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance   What do you think of this   Kitty drew a little note from her bos	29.649564743041992
2822/3605	For me said DArtagnan seizing the	25.33453369140625

2825/3605	As quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was	91.98013305664062
2826/3605	Oh good Lord Monsieur Chevalier said she what are you doing   I said DArtagnan nothing and he read   You have not answered my first	35.05952835083008

2830/3605	Poor dear Monsieur dArtagnan said Kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans	64.48326110839844
2831/3605	You pity me little one said DArtagn	120.61406707763672

2834/3605	Well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your	70.41484069824219

2840/3605	Kitty said he I will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like dont let that disturb	160.4836883544922
2841/3605	And he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a	139.6410369873047

2854/3605	Here am I Milady here am I cried Kitty springing forward to meet her	472.9753723144531
2855/3605	Both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open DArtagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her	117.90018463134766

2865/3605	DArtagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindness	184.935546875
2866/3605	For all this continued Milady I should long ago have revenged myself on him if and I dont know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate	147.433349609375
2867/3605	Oh yes but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond	218.17214965820312

2869/3605	Why this woman was a monster He resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was	441.7872619628906
2870/3605	That will do said Milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave	195.8428955078125
2871/3605	To be sure for Monsieur de Ward	415.7670593261719
2872/3605	Now there is one said Kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor Monsieur dArtagn	46.44682312011719
2873/3605	Go to bed mademoiselle said Milady I dont like	148.0714569091797
2874/3605	DArtagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which Milady fastened herself	84.27188110351562
2875/3605	On her side but as softly as possible Kitty turned the key of the lock and then DArtagnan opened the closet	116.27588653564453
2876/3605	Oh good Lord said Kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you How pale you are   The abominable creature murmured DArtagn	37.86026382446289
2877/3605	There is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and Miladys every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the	118.01261138916016
2878/3605	Thats exactly the reason I wont go said DArtagn	89.9158935546875
2879/3605	She had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much	347.0365295410156
2880/3605	It was a movement of vengeance upon Mil	289.1844177246094
2881/3605	DArtagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the	98.1385269165039
2882/3605	With a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and	143.09632873535156
2883/3605	It must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of M	187.27601623535156
2884/3605	Bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to DArtagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secretsonly she believed she could say she was not	134.4829864501953
2885/3605	As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal Kitty knew nothing about it but this time DArtagnan was better informed than she	94.94139862060547
2886/3605	As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving England he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond stud	104.67794799804688
2887/3605	But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of Milady was increased by his not having killed her brotherin	138.2107391357422
2888/3605	DArtagnan came the next day to Miladys and finding her in a very illhumor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from	105.63350677490234
2889/3605	Kitty came in but Milady was very cross with	644.4010620117188
2890/3605	DArtagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to Milady he had framed a little plan in his	141.47198486328125
2891/3605	He found Kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her	110.12213897705078
2892/3605	Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely sc	9979.2138671875
2893/3605	Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes and she ordered Kitty to come at nine oclock in the morning to take a third	130.6092529296875
2894/3605	DArtagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following	97.98188018798828
2895/3605	The poor girl promised all her lover desired she was	341.2255859375
2896/3605	Things passed as on the night	105.0877914428711
2897/3605	DArtagnan concealed himself in his closet Milady called undressed sent away Kitty and shut the	178.7265167236328
2898/3605	As the night before DArtagnan did not return home till five oclock in the	15.11793327331543
2899/3605	At eleven oclock Kitty came to	370.351318359375
2900/3605	She held in her hand a fresh billet from Mil	234.23403930664062
2901/3605	This time the poor girl did not even argue with DArtagnan she gave it to him at	44.7911376953125
2902/3605	She belonged body and soul to her handsome	1708.4970703125
2903/3605	DArtagnan opened the letter and read as follows   This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love	16.553083419799805
2904/3605	Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I detest	59.652992248535156
2905/3605	If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the     young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit     may obtain his	206.3795928955078
2906/3605	DArtagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this b	179.29039001464844
2907/3605	Oh you love her still said Kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young mans countenance for an	79.26536560058594
2908/3605	I do not love her but I will avenge myself for her	44.50354766845703
2909/3605	Oh yes I know what sort of vengeance You told me that   What matters it to you Kitty You know it is you alone whom I	75.64611053466797
2910/3605	How can I know that   By the scorn I will throw upon	240.06320190429688
2911/3605	But now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness     since not only your letter but your servant assures me that I have     the good fortune to be beloved by	143.38259887695312
2912/3605	She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit     may obtain his	214.69468688964844
2913/3605	I will come and ask mine at eleven oclock     this	72.01174926757812
2914/3605	To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh    	630.8200073242188
2915/3605	From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men     COMTE DE WARDES     This note was in the first place a forgery it was likewise an indelic	1224.6539306640625
2916/3605	It was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do	255.72866821289062
2917/3605	Besides DArtagnan from her own admission knew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for	392.3725891113281
2918/3605	And yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veinspassion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader ple	1686.3475341796875
2919/3605	By Kittys chamber he could gain that of her	2158.81005859375
2920/3605	He would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over	263.4588928222656
2921/3605	He might fail but something must be left to	321.7132568359375
2922/3605	In eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave Paris DArtagnan had no time for a prolonged love	97.54214477539062
2923/3605	There said the young man handing Kitty the letter sealed give that to Mil	422.52874755859375
2924/3605	Poor Kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter	710.3814086914062
2925/3605	Listen my dear girl said DArtagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or	80.2041244506836
2926/3605	Milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the counts that it is I who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de Ward	237.3481903076172
2927/3605	Milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her	334.2262268066406
2928/3605	Alas said Kitty for whom have I exposed myself to all that   For me I well know my sweet girl said DArtagn	91.23644256591797
2929/3605	But I am grateful I swear to	39.729373931884766
2930/3605	But what does this note contain   Milady will tell	62.7206916809082
2931/3605	Ah you do not love me cried Kitty and I am very	116.45022583007812
2932/3605	To this reproach there is always one response which deludes	915.6074829101562
2933/3605	DArtagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great	181.75733947753906
2934/3605	Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all DArtagnan	399.76336669921875
2935/3605	Finally he promised that he would leave her mistresss presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the	149.1396026611328
2936/3605	IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF     Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between	21505.69921875
2937/3605	They dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they	200.9405517578125
2938/3605	This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to find DArtagn	91.63158416748047
2939/3605	Soon as Kitty left him DArtagnan directed his steps toward the Rue Fé	49.03595733642578
2940/3605	Aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cass	63.609745025634766
2941/3605	Athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded	553.7423706054688
2942/3605	Athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free	63.188838958740234
2943/3605	He never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked	169.5013885498047
2944/3605	People in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given	103.5777587890625
2945/3605	The four countenances expressed four different feelings that of Porthos tranquillity that of DArtagnan hope that of Aramis uneasiness that of Athos care	79.42938995361328
2946/3605	At the end of a moments conversation in which Porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his embarrassment Mousqueton	328.1911926269531
2947/3605	He came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously	135.94430541992188
2948/3605	Is it my equipment   Yes and no replied Mousqu	81.50200653076172
2949/3605	Well but cant you speak   Come monsie	42.32852554321289
2950/3605	Porthos rose saluted his friends and followed Mousqu	48.52174758911133
2951/3605	An instant after Bazin made his appearance at the	52.88521957397461
2952/3605	What do you want with me my friend said Aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the	91.72859191894531
2953/3605	A man wishes to see Monsieur at home replied Baz	112.70372009277344

2956/3605	This mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see	59.914119720458984
2957/3605	Has he sent no particular message for me  	120.5125961303711
2958/3605	If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come he said tell him I am from	183.6173553466797
2959/3605	A thousand pardons gentlemen but no doubt this man brings me the news I	302.01806640625
2960/3605	And rising also he went off at a quick	151.07940673828125
2961/3605	I believe these fellows have managed their	1135.593994140625
2962/3605	What do you think DArtagnan said Ath	7.5630388259887695
2963/3605	I know that Porthos was in a fair way replied DArtagnan and as to Aramis to tell you the truth I have never been seriously uneasy on his	31.20440673828125
2964/3605	Go to my dear Athos you have truly inconceivable	144.75405883789062
2965/3605	Oh ay the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice which naturally you took care not to	661.6622924804688
2966/3605	Yes you look there for your outfit I think you	193.7340087890625
2967/3605	I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of Madame Bonacie	140.4646453857422
2968/3605	Yes I understand now to find one woman you court	317.5943908691406
2969/3605	It is the longest road but certainly the most	660.4310913085938
2970/3605	DArtagnan was on the point of telling Athos all but one consideration restrained	54.17292785644531
2971/3605	Athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this Pur	254.15367126464844
2972/3605	He was therefore silent and as Athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth DArtagnans confidence stopped	67.35031127929688
2973/3605	We will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow Aram	69.03096771240234
2974/3605	Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from Tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before Bazin he ran without stopping from the Rue Férou to the Rue de Vaugir	70.68700408935547
2975/3605	On entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with r	153.38577270507812
2976/3605	You have asked for me said the Musket	173.90890502929688
2977/3605	I wish to speak with Monsieur Aram	12.714132308959961
2978/3605	Is that your name monsieur   My very	68.43464660644531
2979/3605	You have brought me something   Yes if you show me a certain embroidered handker	77.86701202392578
2980/3605	Here it is said Aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it	151.80645751953125
2981/3605	That is right replied the mendicant dismiss your lac	161.8736114501953
2982/3605	In fact Bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to	78.06073760986328
2983/3605	At the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to	50.5318489074707
2984/3605	Perform your duty in camp I will do mine	3399.24169921875
2985/3605	Accept that which the bearer brings you make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black	693.6392822265625
2986/3605	Aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript  	327.5981140136719
2987/3605	You may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of Spain     Golden dreams cried Aram	759.4149169921875
2988/3605	Bazin scratched at the door and as Aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come	62.84981155395508
2989/3605	Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce DArtagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to Aramis on leaving Ath	38.17577362060547
2990/3605	Now as DArtagnan used no ceremony with Aramis seeing that Bazin forgot to announce him he announced	86.36314392089844
2991/3605	The devil my dear Aramis said DArtagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from Tours I beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers	92.38809204101562
2992/3605	You are mistaken friend DArtagnan said Aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in onesyllable verse which I began y	237.10374450683594
2993/3605	Well your publisher is very generous my dear Aramis thats all I can	160.0288543701172
2994/3605	How monsieur cried Bazin a poem sell so dear as that It is incredible Oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benser	59.10951614379883
2995/3605	A poet is as good as an abb	57.075904846191406
2996/3605	Ah Monsieur Aramis become a poet I beg of	37.66455841064453
2997/3605	Bazin my friend said Aramis I believe you meddle with my	41.86455535888672
2998/3605	Bazin perceived he was wrong he bowed and went	95.74678039550781
2999/3605	Ah said DArtagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in	106.65090942382812
3000/3605	You are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your	135.90528869628906
3001/3605	Aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his double	314.54473876953125
3002/3605	My dear DArtagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as I am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your	42.477542877197266
3003/3605	My faith said DArtagnan with great	26.617177963256836
3004/3605	It is long since we have had a good dinner and I for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry I confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old Burg	87.59671783447266
3005/3605	Agreed as to the old Burgundy I have no objection to that said Aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of	226.65553283691406
3006/3605	And having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a tal	268.3115234375
3007/3605	The two friends repaired to Athoss and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to	233.4302520751953
3008/3605	As he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy DArtagnan and Aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to	89.04849243164062
3009/3605	They went to find Porthos and at the corner of the Rue Bac met Mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a	52.02914047241211
3010/3605	DArtagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from	20.53873062133789
3011/3605	Aramis look at that horse   Oh the frightful brute said Aram	76.53313446044922
3012/3605	Ah my dear replied DArtagnan upon that very horse I came to	37.82917022705078
3013/3605	What does Monsieur know this horse said Mousqu	72.52554321289062
3014/3605	It is of an original color said Aramis I never saw one with such a hide in my	84.47352600097656
3015/3605	I can well believe it replied DArtagnan and that was why I got three crowns for	40.54419708251953
3016/3605	It must have been for his hide for _certes_ the carcass is not worth eighteen liv	328.6863708496094
3017/3605	She had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent Spanish _genet_ and an Andalusian mule which were beautiful to look	239.86419677734375
3018/3605	The husband heard of the affair on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible	460.40069580078125
3019/3605	Which you are taking back to him said DArtagn	24.523889541625977
3020/3605	You may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to	70.21387481689453
3021/3605	No _pardieu_ though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow	62.00511169433594
3022/3605	That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in	80.91928100585938
3023/3605	But dont let us hinder you Mousqueton go and perform your masters	94.3304443359375

3026/3605	He having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in	214.89410400390625
3027/3605	Meanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the Pont Neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the Rue aux O	200.33578491210938
3028/3605	Arrived there he fastened according to the orders of his master both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurators door then without taking any thought for their future he returned to Porthos and told him that his commission was	211.8490753173828
3029/3605	Coquenard recognized her present and could not at first comprehend this restitution but the visit of Porthos soon enlightened	785.283447265625

3039/3605	There is no harm in trying to buy things cheap Monsieur Porthos said the procurators wife seeking to excuse	654.4683837890625
3040/3605	No madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous	603.4126586914062
3041/3605	And Porthos turning on his heel made a step to	118.99974822998047
3042/3605	Monsieur Porthos Monsieur Porthos cried the procurators	112.21370697021484

3047/3605	Stop in the name of heaven Monsieur Porthos cried	33.32623291015625
3048/3605	Talking with you brings me misfortune said Porth	92.14212036132812
3049/3605	But tell me what do you ask   Nothing for that amounts to the same thing as if I asked you for	41.20215606689453

3057/3605	As was his custom DArtagnan presented himself at Miladys at about nine o	62.484718322753906
3058/3605	He found her in a charming	271.3424377441406
3059/3605	Never had he been so well	64.7099380493164
3060/3605	Our Gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its	99.6983871459961
3061/3605	Her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice Miladys condesc	135.48858642578125
3062/3605	DArtagnan looked at the two women one after the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in their	88.29397583007812
3063/3605	To the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal to the _soubrette_ she had given the heart of a duc	269.6355285644531
3064/3605	At ten oclock Milady began to appear	411.2911682128906
3065/3605	She looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at DArtagnan with an air which said You are very amiable no doubt but you would be _charming_ if you would only	184.89358520507812
3066/3605	DArtagnan rose and took his hat Milady gave him her hand to	46.284114837646484
3067/3605	The young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his	117.51480865478516
3068/3605	This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great	170.95066833496094
3069/3605	It was necessary that DArtagnan should find alone the staircase and the little	62.83699417114258
3070/3605	She heard him enter but she did not raise her	47.94547653198242
3071/3605	The young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed	51.55551528930664
3072/3605	As DArtagnan had presumed on receiving his letter Milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given Kitty a	167.80238342285156
3073/3605	Returning to her own room Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the	238.922119140625
3074/3605	The poor girl under the caresses of DArtagnan lifted her	52.0510368347168
3075/3605	DArtagnan himself was frightened by the change in her count	49.33466720581055
3076/3605	She joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a	185.3846893310547
3077/3605	As little sensitive as was the heart of DArtagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in	232.58815002441406
3078/3605	He did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch only he represented his action as one of simple	891.7805786132812
3079/3605	For the rest this vengeance was very easy for Milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered Kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber	155.0872344970703
3080/3605	de Wardes must take his departure still in	1859.8837890625
3081/3605	Presently they heard Milady retire to her	329.099609375
3082/3605	Hardly was he concealed when the little bell	954.87353515625
3083/3605	Kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two	105.50020599365234
3084/3605	Milady seemed overcome with joy and made Kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with De Wardes when he received the letter how he had responded what was the expression of his face if he seemed very am	372.80474853515625
3085/3605	And to all these questions poor Kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egot	555.1263427734375
3086/3605	Finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached Milady had everything about her darkened and ordered Kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce De Wardes whenever he presented	403.9404296875
3087/3605	Hardly had DArtagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when Kitty reclosed the door of	122.97865295410156
3088/3605	It is I said DArtagnan in a subdued voice I the Comte de Ward	114.54937744140625
3089/3605	Oh my God my God murmured Kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named   Well said Milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter Count Count added she you know that I wait for	115.97156524658203
3090/3605	At this appeal DArtagnan drew Kitty quietly away and slipped into the	218.130126953125
3091/3605	If rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy	730.87158203125
3092/3605	DArtagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not fore	100.83353424072266
3093/3605	Jealousy gnawed his heart and he suffered almost as much as poor Kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next	360.09222412109375
3094/3605	Yes Count said Milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own I am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have	102.51740264892578
3095/3605	Oh tomorrow tomorrow I must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto DArtagn	126.91720581054688
3096/3605	DArtagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with brill	51.39854049682617
3097/3605	The first movement of DArtagnan was to return it but Milady added No no Keep that ring for love of	224.94735717773438
3098/3605	Besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you	154.34970092773438
3099/3605	This woman is full of mysteries murmured DArtagnan to	50.989505767822266
3100/3605	At that instant he felt himself ready to reveal	181.7324676513672
3101/3605	He even opened his mouth to tell Milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added Poor angel whom that monster of a Gascon barely failed to	330.1435852050781
3102/3605	Oh continued Milady do your wounds still make you suffer   Yes much said DArtagnan who did not well know how to	78.59741973876953
3103/3605	Be tranquil murmured Milady I will avenge youand cruelly   _Peste_ said DArtagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet	92.90607452392578
3104/3605	It took some time for DArtagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely	92.1312255859375

3106/3605	He would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabol	321.8023986816406
3107/3605	DArtagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following	385.31256103515625
3108/3605	Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to DArtagnan when he passed through her chamber but Milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the	108.7160415649414
3109/3605	The next morning DArtagnan ran to find Ath	30.48188591003418
3110/3605	He was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for	81.6639175415039
3111/3605	Your Milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive	180.91151428222656
3112/3605	In one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your	416.05242919921875
3113/3605	While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on DArtagnans finger the place of the queens ring carefully kept in a c	133.93052673339844
3114/3605	You notice my ring said the Gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his	197.79110717773438
3115/3605	Yes said Athos it reminds me of a family	136.978515625
3116/3605	It is beautiful is it not said DArtagn	17.5136661529541
3117/3605	I did not think two sapphires of such a fine water	226.85037231445312
3118/3605	Have you traded it for your diamond  	232.0300750732422
3119/3605	It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman or rather Frenchwomanfor I am convinced she was born in France though I have not questioned	187.8732147216797
3120/3605	That ring comes from Milady cried Athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong	150.03448486328125
3121/3605	Her very self she gave it me last	1572.384765625
3122/3605	Here it is replied DArtagnan taking it from his	23.585636138916016
3123/3605	Athos examined it and became very	125.54724884033203
3124/3605	He tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for	267.40216064453125
3125/3605	A shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this	291.4134826660156
3126/3605	It is impossible it can be she said	99.74284362792969
3127/3605	How could this ring come into the hands of Milady Clarik And yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two	586.6846313476562
3128/3605	Do you know this ring said DArtagn	20.405302047729492
3129/3605	I thought I did replied Athos but no doubt I was	39.11338806152344
3130/3605	And he returned DArtagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at	72.51901245117188
3131/3605	Pray DArtagnan said Athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that I shall have no head to converse with	193.87588500976562
3132/3605	Dont ask me for counsel dont tell me you are perplexed what to	186.51858520507812
3133/3605	But stop let me look at that sapphire again the one I mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by	333.4923400878906
3134/3605	DArtagnan took off the ring giving it again to Ath	40.106727600097656
3135/3605	Look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to DArtagnan the scratch he had	68.01780700683594
3136/3605	But from whom did this ring come to you Athos   From my mother who inherited it from her	90.8769302368164
3137/3605	As I told you it is an old family	117.69673156738281
3138/3605	No replied Athos with a singular	19.32128143310547
3139/3605	I gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to	49.775821685791016
3140/3605	DArtagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in Miladys soul whose depths were dark and	191.7718963623047
3141/3605	He took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his	63.13360595703125
3142/3605	DArtagnan said Athos taking his hand you know I love you if I had a son I could not love him	20.64788055419922
3143/3605	I do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about	137.07176208496094
3144/3605	You are right said DArtagnan I will have done with	23.6453914642334

3147/3605	On reaching home DArtagnan found Kitty waiting for	193.16201782226562
3148/3605	A month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and	426.60076904296875

3158/3605	DArtagnan gave the open letter to Kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second	94.00391387939453
3159/3605	She could scarcely believe in her happiness and DArtagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had	79.9602279663086

3181/3605	DARTAGNAN It is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a	496.7680358886719
3182/3605	My brotherinlaw and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in	112.89159393310547
3183/3605	Will it be the same this evening     Your very grateful MILADY CLARIK     Thats all very simple said DArtagnan I expected this	755.5235595703125
3184/3605	My credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Ward	540.1829223632812
3185/3605	Listen to me my dear girl said the Gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive	123.35417175292969
3186/3605	You are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than	84.54564666748047
3187/3605	Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to	1373.08837890625
3188/3605	DArtagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Mil	109.28797912597656
3189/3605	He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her	152.0145721435547
3190/3605	He did not dare to write for fear of not being ableto such experienced eyes as those of Miladyto disguise his writing	415.474365234375
3191/3605	As nine oclock sounded DArtagnan was at the Place	40.696929931640625
3192/3605	It was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as DArtagnan appeared before even he had asked if Milady were visible one of them ran to announce	54.99326705932617
3193/3605	Show him in said Milady in a quick tone but so piercing that DArtagnan heard her in the antech	51.278099060058594
3194/3605	I am at home to nobody said Milady observe to _nobody	1207.166015625
3195/3605	DArtagnan cast an inquiring glance at Mil	25.272010803222656
3196/3605	She was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of	202.17449951171875
3197/3605	The number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two	98.75267028808594
3198/3605	DArtagnan approached her with his usual gall	49.972412109375
3199/3605	She then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable	211.33763122558594
3200/3605	To the questions which DArtagnan put concerning her health she replied Bad very	629.1668701171875
3201/3605	Then replied he my visit is illtimed you no doubt stand in need of repose and I will	357.467529296875
3202/3605	On the contrary stay Monsieur dArtagnan your agreeable company will divert	101.54605865478516
3203/3605	She has never been so kind	56.13406753540039
3204/3605	On guard   Milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brillian	145.06886291503906
3205/3605	At the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her	322.5654602050781
3206/3605	DArtagnan was again in the presence of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her enchant	134.14527893066406
3207/3605	His love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his	210.20947265625
3208/3605	Milady smiled and DArtagnan felt that he could damn himself for that	154.53306579589844
3209/3605	There was a moment at which he felt something like	133.7532958984375
3210/3605	She asked DArtagnan if he had a	22.798946380615234
3211/3605	Have I any need to tell you so Have you not perceived it   It may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be	111.75106811523438
3212/3605	Oh difficulties do not affright me said DArtagn	44.44795227050781
3213/3605	Nothing is impossible replied Milady to true	860.930419921875
3214/3605	Nothing madame   Nothing replied Mil	54.003746032714844
3215/3605	Well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you	55.020545959472656
3216/3605	All that could be required of	94.04973602294922
3217/3605	For everything   For everything cried DArtagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself	74.72286224365234
3218/3605	Well now let us talk a little seriously said Milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to DArtagnans	76.3791732788086
3219/3605	I am all attention madame said	48.89966583251953
3220/3605	Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said I have an	183.59817504882812
3221/3605	You madame said DArtagnan affecting surprise is that possible my Godgood and beautiful as you are   A mortal	168.22506713867188
3222/3605	Indeed   An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the	99.44001007080078
3223/3605	May I reckon on you as an auxiliary   DArtagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to	148.74522399902344
3224/3605	You may madame said he with	194.2255401611328
3225/3605	My arm and my life belong to you like my	246.15863037109375
3226/3605	Then said Milady since you are as generous as you are loving   She	91.861083984375
3227/3605	Well replied Milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of imposs	153.28311157226562
3228/3605	Do not overwhelm me with happiness cried DArtagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to	94.83638000488281
3229/3605	You have understood me then dear Monsieur dArtagnan said Mil	31.364524841308594
3230/3605	I could interpret one of your	1080.8568115234375
3231/3605	Then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown   Instantly   But on my part said Milady how should I repay such a service I know these	111.96570587158203
3232/3605	They are men who do nothing for	160.03036499023438
3233/3605	You know the only reply that I desire said DArtagnan the only one worthy of you and of me   And he drew nearer to	57.587806701660156
3234/3605	Well merit this pretended happiness then   I am at your orders said DArtagn	52.11838150024414
3235/3605	Quite certain said Milady with a last	424.787109375
3236/3605	Only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes   Who told you that I had been weeping said	130.4377899169922
3237/3605	It appeared to me   Such women as I never weep said Mil	201.71641540527344
3238/3605	So much the better Come tell me his name   Remember that his name is all my	58.72065734863281
3239/3605	Yes you must see what confidence I have in you   You overwhelm me with	51.894203186035156
3240/3605	What is his name   You know	12.546767234802246
3241/3605	It is surely not one of my friends replied DArtagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him	100.83051300048828
3242/3605	If it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried Milady and a threatening glance darted from her	222.35769653320312
3243/3605	Not if it were my own brother cried DArtagnan as if carried away by his	62.57729721069336
3244/3605	Our Gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was	318.0849914550781
3245/3605	Alas do you love nothing else in me asked DArtagn	37.5357551574707
3246/3605	I love you also _you_ said she taking his	120.65715026855469
3247/3605	The warm pressure made DArtagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed Milady attacked	366.20404052734375
3248/3605	Oh if that were so I should lose my reason   And he folded her in his	75.6912841796875
3249/3605	She made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to	176.86907958984375
3250/3605	Her lips were cold it appeared to DArtagnan that he had embraced a	132.1788787841797
3251/3605	He was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by	325.0605163574219
3252/3605	He almost believed in the tenderness of Milady he almost believed in the crime of De Ward	314.9011535644531
3253/3605	If De Wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed	380.807373046875
3254/3605	His name is said she in her	201.9034881591797
3255/3605	De Wardes I know it cried DArtagn	73.21157836914062
3256/3605	And how do you know it asked Milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his	72.53031921386719
3257/3605	DArtagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an	31.359411239624023
3258/3605	Tell me tell me tell me I say repeated Milady how do you know it   How do I know it said DArtagn	30.880577087402344
3259/3605	I know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes in a saloon where I was showed a ring which he said he had received from	272.6949157714844
3260/3605	The epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of DArtagnans	72.98104858398438
3261/3605	Well I will avenge you of this wretch replied DArtagnan giving himself the airs of Don Japhet of	247.20269775390625
3262/3605	Thanks my brave friend cried Milady and when shall I be avenged   Tomorrowimmediatelywhen you please   Milady was about to cry out Immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward DArtagn	153.31980895996094
3263/3605	Besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before	209.49159240722656
3264/3605	All this was answered by an expression of DArtagn	48.02771759033203
3265/3605	Tomorrow said he you will be avenged or I shall be	41.24848175048828
3266/3605	No said she you will avenge me but you will not be	37.60346984863281
3267/3605	With women perhaps but not with	1274.2677001953125
3268/3605	But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with	86.99671173095703
3269/3605	Fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back	4530.54345703125
3270/3605	And then accompanying the glance with explanatory words That is but too just said she tender	851.401123046875
3271/3605	Oh you are an angel exclaimed the young	29.796432495117188
3272/3605	Except that which I ask of you dear	145.5461883544922
3273/3605	But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness   I cannot wait till	23.797651290893555
3274/3605	It will be useless for him to find you	59.58755111694336
3275/3605	She rang the bell and Kitty	302.0382385253906
3276/3605	Go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven oclock we will then terminate this	126.6059799194336
3277/3605	Kitty will conduct you to my	447.5272216796875
3278/3605	The poor girl almost fainted at hearing these	126.09578704833984
3279/3605	Well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue Do as I bid you show the chevalier out and this evening at eleven oclockyou have heard what I	93.89030456542969
3280/3605	It appears that these appointments are all made for eleven oclock thought DArtagnan thats a settled	119.95745086669922
3281/3605	Milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tender	168.36422729492188
3282/3605	But said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of Kitty I must not play the	130.2483367919922
3283/3605	This woman is certainly a great	526.183349609375
3284/3605	What was most clear in the matter was that DArtagnan loved Milady like a madman and that she did not love him at	62.70741653442383
3285/3605	But he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of	320.1010437011719
3286/3605	He wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce	62.06424331665039
3287/3605	He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in Miladys apartment which was to be seen through the blind	111.90315246582031
3288/3605	It was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the	26.222923278808594
3289/3605	With this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of DArtagn	113.19766235351562
3290/3605	He recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he reentered the hôtel and flew toward Kittys	300.1634216308594
3291/3605	The poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but Milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise DArtagnan had made and opening the door said Come	113.4679183959961
3292/3605	All this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that DArtagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he	168.48460388183594
3293/3605	He imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in	472.60247802734375
3294/3605	He however darted not the less quickly toward Milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over	5081.18359375
3295/3605	As the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward	288.17724609375
3296/3605	This last thought of love counseled her to make this last	420.62225341796875
3297/3605	DArtagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his	30.5407657623291
3298/3605	It was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently	165.2095184326172
3299/3605	A secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but selflove but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murm	215.8761444091797
3300/3605	And then our Gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with De Wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself   He was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the	322.1824035644531
3301/3605	Milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to	390.81304931640625
3302/3605	But DArtagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrust	173.53257751464844
3303/3605	This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady whose questions became more	1155.1239013671875
3304/3605	Then DArtagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not	62.02273178100586
3305/3605	Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron	1142.3828125
3306/3605	DArtagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to renounce by pardoning De Wardes the furious projects she had	850.03125
3307/3605	He shall die then since you condemn him said DArtagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of	101.58248138427734
3308/3605	We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady but DArtagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its pal	109.10797882080078
3309/3605	Seeing DArtagnan about to leave her Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Ward	179.03453063964844
3310/3605	I am quite ready said DArtagnan but in the first place I should like to be certain of one	16.43154525756836
3311/3605	That is whether you really love me   I have given you proof of that it seems to	27.854337692260742
3312/3605	And I am yours body and soul   Thanks my brave lover but as you are satisfied of my love you must in your turn satisfy me of	183.73585510253906
3313/3605	Is it not so   Certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied DArtagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account   What have I to fear   Why that I may be dangerously woundedkilled	36.18694305419922
3314/3605	Impossible cried Milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swords	413.4239807128906
3315/3605	You would not then prefer a method resumed DArtagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless   Milady looked at her lover in	223.7156219482422
3316/3605	The pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful	138.5547332763672
3317/3605	Really said she I believe you now begin to	90.0469741821289
3318/3605	No I do not hesitate but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes since you have ceased to love	178.2877197265625
3319/3605	I think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastis	122.38150787353516
3320/3605	Who told you that I loved him asked Milady	128.4345245361328
3321/3605	At least I am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and I repeat that I am really interested for the	104.0624771118164
3322/3605	And why _you_   Because I alone know   What   That he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he	111.09761810302734
3323/3605	Indeed said Milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for I really cannot tell what you	119.88082122802734
3324/3605	And she looked at DArtagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves	35.506099700927734
3325/3605	Yes I am a man of honor said DArtagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and I am satisfied I possess itfor I do possess it do I not   Entirely go	42.222694396972656
3326/3605	Well I feel as if transformeda confession weighs on my	519.684326171875
3327/3605	A confession   If I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not   Without	41.136234283447266
3328/3605	Then if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me  	136.33204650878906
3329/3605	DArtagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Miladys but she evaded	89.46968078613281
3330/3605	Do not lie my angel said DArtagnan smiling that would be	84.55174255371094
3331/3605	What do you mean Speak you kill	207.0987548828125
3332/3605	Be satisfied you are not guilty toward me and I have already pardoned	73.6743392944336
3333/3605	What next what next   De Wardes cannot boast of	1506.824951171875
3334/3605	How is that You told me yourself that that ring   That ring I have The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the DArtagnan of today are the same	221.2899169921875
3335/3605	The imprudent young man expected a surprise mixed with shamea slight storm which would resolve itself into tears but he was strangely deceived and his error was not of long	279.8757019042969
3336/3605	Pale and trembling Milady repulsed DArtagnans attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of	227.4362335205078
3337/3605	DArtagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen to implore her pardon but she with a strong movement tried to	349.4068298339844
3338/3605	Great God cried DArtagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and	309.57855224609375
3339/3605	But Milady felt herself denounced even by his	961.1016235351562
3340/3605	The young man now knew her secret her terrible secretthe secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except	475.3199157714844
3341/3605	She turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded pant	369.9868469238281
3342/3605	Ah wretch cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret You shall	293.1391296386719
3343/3605	Although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding	476.2893981933594
3344/3605	He recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabb	91.68254089355469
3345/3605	But without taking any heed of the sword Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her	167.16835021972656
3346/3605	Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable	789.9053344726562
3347/3605	As all this however bore some resemblance to a duel DArtagnan began to recover himself little by	157.11428833007812
3348/3605	Well beautiful lady very well said he but _pardieu_ if you dont calm yourself I will design a second _fleurdelis_ upon one of those pretty cheeks   Scoundrel infamous scoundrel howled Mil	429.3836364746094
3349/3605	But DArtagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to Kittys	462.5157470703125
3350/3605	At the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach Kitty opened the	666.1166381835938
3351/3605	DArtagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from	209.710693359375
3352/3605	With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while Kitty pushed the	374.4889831542969
3353/3605	Then Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the	328.72869873046875
3354/3605	Every blow was accompanied with terrible imprec	249.0377197265625
3355/3605	Quick Kitty quick said DArtagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel for if we leave her time to turn round she will have me killed by the	106.09979248046875
3356/3605	But you cant go out so said Kitty you are	474.29974365234375
3357/3605	Thats true said DArtagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in thats	213.32244873046875
3358/3605	But dress me as well as you are able only make haste think my dear girl its life and death   Kitty was but too well aware of	197.04788208007812
3359/3605	In a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a	682.0029296875
3360/3605	She gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the	82.77711486816406
3361/3605	Milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hô	961.6219482421875
3362/3605	The porter was drawing the cord at the moment Milady cried from her window Dont open   The young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent	198.36460876464844
3363/3605	The moment she lost sight of him Milady tumbled fainting into her	260.15704345703125
3364/3605	The confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his	218.0262451171875
3365/3605	He crossed the court ran up the two flights to Athoss apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it	111.72166442871094
3366/3605	Grimaud came rubbing his halfopen eyes to answer this noisy summons and DArtagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lac	429.0610656738281
3367/3605	In spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his	220.7917938232422
3368/3605	Holloa there cried he what do you want you strumpet Whats your business here you hussy   DArtagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the	301.72528076171875
3369/3605	At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a	341.54254150390625
3370/3605	He then concluded it must be an	104.08019256591797
3371/3605	Hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man I am DArtagnan dont you know me Where is your master   You Monsieur dArtagnan cried Grimaud	30.176183700561523
3372/3605	Athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyespetticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with	536.7333374023438
3373/3605	Come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be	59.07457733154297

3377/3605	Are you _sure_ that the _other_ is dead   _The other_ said Athos in so stifled a voice that DArtagnan scarcely heard	48.90859603881836
3378/3605	Yes she of whom you told me one day at Am	164.6706085205078
3379/3605	Athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his	57.44135665893555
3380/3605	This is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight	51.885196685791016
3381/3605	Fair said Athos is she not  	30.968935012817383
3382/3605	Blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows  	105.89974212646484
3383/3605	Tall wellmade She has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left  	874.5944213867188
3384/3605	The _fleurdelis_ is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices  	585.395263671875
3385/3605	But you say she is English   She is called Milady but she may be	70.2588119506836
3386/3605	Lord de Winter is only her brotherin	102.2401123046875
3387/3605	I will see her DArtagnan   Beware Athos	70.73848724365234
3388/3605	You tried to kill her she is a woman to return you the like and not to	170.5330047607422
3389/3605	She will not dare to say anything that would be to denounce	121.45540618896484
3390/3605	She is capable of anything or	322.7310485839844
3391/3605	Did you ever see her furious   No said Ath	50.39912796020508
3392/3605	A tigress a panther Ah my dear Athos I am greatly afraid I have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us   DArtagnan then related allthe mad passion of Milady and her menaces of	250.625
3393/3605	You are right and upon my soul I would give my life for a hair said Ath	54.905540466308594
3394/3605	Fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave	32.13446044921875
3395/3605	We are going according to all probability to La Rochelle and once gone   She will follow you to the end of the world Athos if she recognizes	65.2304916381836
3396/3605	Let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone   My dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said Ath	176.18801879882812
3397/3605	Do you perchance think I set any great store by life   There is something horribly mysterious under all this Athos this woman is one of the cardinals spies I am sure of	171.96192932128906
3398/3605	If you go out do not go out alone when you eat use every	266.31646728515625
3399/3605	Mistrust everything in short even your own	1258.57861328125

3401/3605	In the meantime said Athos I renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go I will go with	82.61968994140625
3402/3605	You must return to the Rue des Fossoyeurs I will accompany	46.25807189941406
3403/3605	But however near it may be replied DArtagnan I cannot go thither in this	80.73070526123047
3404/3605	Thats true said Athos and he rang the	106.83821105957031
3405/3605	Athos made him a sign to go to DArtagnans residence and bring back some	60.58721923828125
3406/3605	Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set	428.1089172363281
3407/3605	All this will not advance your outfit said Athos for if I am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with Milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to	97.22981262207031
3408/3605	The jewel is yours my dear Athos Did you not tell me it was a family jewel   Yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told	68.25514221191406
3409/3605	It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is	103.39646911621094

3412/3605	I take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature Never that ring is defiled DArtagn	239.85025024414062
3413/3605	Sell a jewel which came from my mother I vow I should consider it a profan	214.21243286132812
3414/3605	Pledge it then you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on	114.11257934570312
3415/3605	With that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of us	256.97967529296875
3416/3605	You are a capital companion DArtagnan said he your neverfailing cheerfulness raises poor souls in aff	753.0525512695312
3417/3605	Well let us pledge the ring but upon one	246.95103454589844
3418/3605	What   That there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for	23.138532638549805
3419/3605	I dont need the quarter of such a sumI who am still only in the Guardsand by selling my saddles I shall procure	293.2626037597656
3420/3605	What do I want A horse for Planchet thats	122.20796203613281
3421/3605	Besides you forget that I have a ring	173.90542602539062
3422/3605	To which you attach more value it seems than I do to mine at least I have thought	188.0248565673828
3423/3605	Yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great	245.98733520507812
3424/3605	It is not only a valuable diamond but it is an enchanted tal	640.1296997070312
3425/3605	I dont at all understand you but I believe all you say to be	86.6380844116211
3426/3605	Let us return to my ring or rather to	469.3626708984375
3427/3605	You shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or I will throw it into the Seine and I doubt as was the case with Polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to	195.00254821777344
3428/3605	Well I will take it then said DArtagn	10.940816879272461
3429/3605	At this moment Grimaud returned accompanied by Planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments	74.3573989868164
3430/3605	DArtagnan dressed himself and Athos did the	26.832542419433594
3431/3605	When the two were ready to go out the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his	93.32544708251953
3432/3605	They arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoye	114.587890625
3433/3605	Bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at DArtagnan hate	52.779136657714844
3434/3605	Make haste dear lodger said he there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs and you know women dont like to be kept	235.74932861328125
3435/3605	Thats Kitty said DArtagnan to himself and darted into the	45.21352005004883
3436/3605	Sure enough Upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a trem	111.22986602783203
3437/3605	As soon as she perceived him she cried You have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her	153.89295959472656
3438/3605	Remember it is you who have ruined me   Yes yes to be sure Kitty said DArtagnan be at ease my	70.86820220947266
3439/3605	But what happened after my departure   How can I tell said	122.90056610107422
3440/3605	The lackeys were brought by the cries she	107.26516723632812
3441/3605	There exist no imprecations she did not pour out against	389.5804138183594
3442/3605	Then I thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose I was your accomplice so I took what little money I had and the best of my things and I got	151.8813934326172
3443/3605	Poor dear girl But what can I do with you I am going away the day after	45.76010513305664
3444/3605	Help me out of Paris help me out of France   I cannot take you however to the siege of La Rochelle said DArtagn	39.105525970458984
3445/3605	No but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for	173.55426025390625
3446/3605	My dear little love In my country the ladies do without chambermaid	2793.422607421875
3447/3605	But stop I can manage your business for	244.0398712158203
3448/3605	We have something very important to say to	47.49936294555664
3449/3605	I understand said Athos but why not Porthos I should have thought that his duchess   Oh Porthoss duchess is dressed by her husbands clerks said DArtagnan	38.18684387207031
3450/3605	Besides Kitty would not like to live in the Rue aux O	532.3754272460938
3451/3605	Isnt it so Kitty   I do not care where I live said Kitty provided I am well concealed and nobody knows where I	328.443359375
3452/3605	Meanwhile Kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me   Monsieur Chevalier far off or near said Kitty I shall always love	102.10983276367188

3456/3605	I attach great importance to the question I am about to put to	46.71757888793945
3457/3605	I cried Athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an add	109.6951675415039
3458/3605	You to be sure said DArtagnan pressing Athoss	23.257822036743164
3459/3605	You know the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacie	319.5701599121094
3460/3605	Besides Kitty will tell nothing will you Kitty You understand my dear girl continued DArtagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came	252.31210327148438

3467/3605	He has gone said he and the house door is	136.0652618408203
3468/3605	He has gone to make his report and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dove	309.1370544433594
3469/3605	Well then let us all fly said Athos and leave nobody here but Planchet to bring us	94.38888549804688
3470/3605	Aramis whom we have sent for   Thats true said Athos we must wait for Aram	15.07484245300293
3471/3605	The matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for	131.6002960205078
3472/3605	Aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring Will it be really rendering you a service DArtagnan   I shall be grateful to you all my	42.74645233154297
3473/3605	Madame de BoisTracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces I believe for a trustworthy	806.0631103515625
3474/3605	If you can my dear DArtagnan answer for Mademoiselle   Oh monsieur be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting	20.817739486694336
3475/3605	Then said Aramis this falls out very	186.482666015625
3476/3605	He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to	121.77987670898438
3477/3605	And now my dear girl said DArtagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be	26.371320724487305

3482/3605	Aramis returned home and Athos and DArtagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapp	245.8937530517578
3483/3605	As the Gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the	130.83914184570312

3485/3605	Athos and DArtagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musket	84.75231170654297
3486/3605	Besides Athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers	102.36152648925781

3495/3605	But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his	85.76979064941406
3496/3605	How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said Ath	165.58729553222656
3497/3605	That is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for	35.50758361816406
3498/3605	Well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the Jews	112.30534362792969
3499/3605	What will you   This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the	133.8832244873047
3500/3605	Go and tell him the ring is his DArtagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with	51.398590087890625
3501/3605	Reflect Athos   Ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make	211.98660278320312
3502/3605	Go DArtagnan go Grimaud will accompany you with his musket	64.35600280761719
3503/3605	A half hour afterward DArtagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any	68.21509552001953
3504/3605	It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not	238.50494384765625
3505/3605	A VISION     At four oclock the four friends were all assembled with Ath	140.6437225341797
3506/3605	Their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquietfor behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the	454.67059326171875
3507/3605	Suddenly Planchet entered bringing two letters for DArtagn	38.21731185913086
3508/3605	The one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green	1789.8587646484375
3509/3605	The other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his Eminence the cardinal d	126.9566650390625
3510/3605	At the sight of the little letter the heart of DArtagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his	60.69600296020508
3511/3605	He therefore seized the little epistle and opened it	173.53506469726562
3512/3605	Thats a snare said Athos dont go DArtagn	70.0926742553711
3513/3605	And yet replied DArtagnan I think I recognize the	36.443443298339844
3514/3605	Between six and seven oclock the road of Chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of Bond	445.06927490234375
3515/3605	But suppose we all go said DArtagnan what the devil They wont devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all   And besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said Porth	124.85889434814453
3516/3605	But if it is a woman who writes said Aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her DArtagnan which is not the part of a	86.7885513305664
3517/3605	We will remain in the background said Porthos and he will advance	44.47074890136719
3518/3605	Yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gall	99.2247314453125
3519/3605	Bah said DArtagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in	57.080589294433594
3520/3605	Besides we must try our own	185.53866577148438
3521/3605	Bah let us enjoy that pleasure said Aramis with his mild and careless	166.4544677734375
3522/3605	Gentlemen said DArtagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by	119.56517791748047
3523/3605	Besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said Porthos and that will be a	57.6692008972168
3524/3605	But this second letter said Athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be	191.94764709472656
3525/3605	For my part I declare DArtagnan I think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bos	115.65773010253906
3526/3605	Well said he let us see gentlemen what are his Eminences commands and DArtagnan unsealed the letter and read  	69.19746398925781

3531/3605	Hum I would not go at all said Aram	52.05790328979492

3533/3605	I am of Aramiss opinion said Porth	45.93665313720703

3535/3605	I neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meConstance	467.8802795410156

3538/3605	Let us do better than that said Athos do not let us leave him during the whole	39.00923156738281
3539/3605	Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three Musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon	185.65220642089844
3540/3605	It is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal Monsieur de Tréville must think us	44.31180953979492
3541/3605	To a certainty Athos said Aramis you were meant to be a general of the army What do you think of the plan gentlemen   Admirable replied the young men in	59.645938873291016

3544/3605	I have no horse said DArtagnan but that is of no consequence I can take one of Monsieur de Trév	29.25885009765625
3545/3605	That is not worth while said Aramis you can have one of	50.007965087890625
3546/3605	One of yours how many have you then asked DArtagn	39.63642501831055

3548/3605	Well my dear Aramis you dont want three horses I cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three   Therefore I only purchased two said Aram	145.74850463867188
3549/3605	The third then fell from the clouds I suppose   No the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his	105.17642974853516
3550/3605	That makes no difference said Aramis coloring and who affirmed as I said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it	303.16387939453125
3551/3605	It is only to poets that such things happen said Athos grave	147.971435546875

3553/3605	You cannot for a moment imagine DArtagnan that I would commit such an offense toward   The unknown giver interrupted DArtagn	121.15035247802734
3554/3605	The one you bought will then become useless to you   Nearly	204.71554565429688

3583/3605	At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of	585.1611328125

3585/3605	DArtagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was	130.88755798339844
3586/3605	At length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of Sèv	121.98583984375
3587/3605	A presentiment instantly told DArtagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so	82.83009338378906
3588/3605	Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a	282.4861755371094

3597/3605	If that be the case said DArtagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to	114.29839324951172
